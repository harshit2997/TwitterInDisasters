Everest may have shrunk: Report

The devastating earthquake that has rocked Nepal not only killed thousands but may have also shrunk the height of the world's tallest peak — Mount Everest — by about 2.5 cm, according to analysis of satellite data.

The first good view of the aftermath of Nepal's deadly earthquake from a satellite showed that a broad swath of ground near Kathmandu lifted vertically, by about 1 metre, which could explain why damage in the city was so severe.

The data also indicated the tallest mountain in the world, Mount Everest, got a wee bit shorter, Live Science reported.

The new information comes from Europe's Sentinel-1A radar satellite.

Scientists are racing to interpret the Sentinel data, which were made available last week just hours after the satellite passed over Nepal.

The devastating 7.8-magnitude earthquake that struck Nepal on April 25 has claimed over 8,500 lives and injured another 16,390 people.

Researchers detected the vertical shift in the ground by comparing before-and-after radar images from the satellite using a technique that produces an image called an interferogram.

The resulting images have rainbow-coloured areas that represent the movement of the ground between the times each radar image was taken. Each colourful fringe on the European Space Agency's Nepal interferogramme reflects about 2.8 centimetres of vertical movement.

The results will be refined in the coming weeks, with as scientists further analysis the images and additional data from satellites become available.

According to the early analysis, a region 120 km long by 50 km) wide lifted upward by as much as 3 feet during the earthquake, said Tim Wright, a geophysicist at the University of Leeds in the United Kingdom.
