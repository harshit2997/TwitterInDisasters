WASHINGTON, D.C., May 11 /CSRwire/ - Donors from more than 106 countries have given more than $3 million for Nepal Earthquake Relief in less than two weeks through the crowdfunding community, GlobalGiving. The donations have come from more than 28,000 donors, including young children, grandparents, Nepali citizens, climbers who have summited Mt. Everest, and leading companies and their employees.

GlobalGiving’s Nepal Earthquake Relief Fund supports 69 vetted, locally driven nonprofits responding to the tragedy in Nepal. A single donation to GlobalGiving’s Nepal Earthquake Relief Fund fuels both the immediate work of first responders as well as long-term recovery efforts by local organizations.

"Empowering our global community to support one another is at the heart of our mission," said Mari Kuraishi, Co Founder and President of GlobalGiving. "With GlobalGiving, it’s possible for anyone in the world to make a meaningful, positive difference, especially after a tragedy like this earthquake. We’re inspired to see people from all over the world giving what they can to support the survivors in Nepal."

Initial funding has been disbursed to the mix of partners that have been first responders providing emergency rescue and relief, including IsraAid, MAP International, Women LEAD, and Save the Children. The fund is also supporting the long-term rebuilding and recovery effort by Nepali organizations including Environmental Camps for Conservation Awareness, Ama Ghar, and Empower Dalit Women of Nepal. GlobalGiving posts regular updates that are also emailed to donors on how the funds are being put to work: http://www.globalgiving.org/projects/nepal-earthquake-relief-fund/updates/

In order to ensure that local nonprofits are not inundated with a one-time flood of funding without ongoing support to sustain their recovery efforts, a generous donor is matching the first donation of all new recurring monthly donations to the Fund, or to individual recovery projects in Nepal. Details about this recurring donation match offer can be found at:http:///www.globalgiving.org/recurring-donations-matched/nepal-matching/

GlobalGiving’s corporate partners have also joined the effort to support relief and recovery in Nepal. Discovery Communications, Ford Motor Company Fund, TripAdvisor, and VMware Foundation were among the first to pledge grants to the Nepal Earthquake Relief Fund, giving more than $470,000. Companies including BlackRock, Celanese Foundation, Discovery, DuPont, Ford, Lilly, NetSuite, Nike, VMware, and others are matching employee donations or providing additional contributions.

Other companies are also supporting the relief and recovery effort: “beyond funding and network connections, we'll also be supporting Nepali organizations with technical and capacity support,” said Britt Lake, Senior Director of Programs at GlobalGiving. “For example, several of our partners expressed a need to track data about their work, and we’ve connected them with a company, Journey, that is working with them to develop custom mobile apps to help meet those needs.”

GlobalGiving’s focus is on supporting the locally driven long-term recovery effort by Nepali organizations in the months and years that follow this disaster. Nepali NGOs have been part of the GlobalGiving community for more than a decade. Prior to the earthquake on April 25th, GlobalGiving had helped raise more than $1.3 million for more than 100 projects in Nepal. GlobalGiving vets each of its nonprofit partners and requires regular reporting on how funds are used.
