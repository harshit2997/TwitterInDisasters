New Delhi: The earthquake that struck Nepal on Saturday, killing more than 5,500 people besides claiming scores of lives in India and China, seems to have brought a new thaw in India-Pakistan relations.

Pakistan prime minister Nawaz Sharif called his Indian counterpart Narendra Modi on Thursday to express his condolence over the loss of lives in India.

Later, in a series of posts on Twitter, Modi said he had suggested to Sharif that all countries in South Asia should together conduct training exercises for personnel in disaster relief and rescue.

“PM Sharif appreciated this idea & told me that we should take up such an initiative,” one of Modi’s tweets said.

Sharif and Modi also discussed the recent unseasonal rain and the consequent damage to crops, another of Modi’s tweets said.

Sharif’s call to Modi came a day after news reports quoted the Pakistani PM as saying that India has failed to respond to Pakistan’s desire for good relations.

Thursday’s interaction is the second time in recent weeks that adversity has brought together the two countries, who have fought four wars since their independence from British rule in 1947.

On 8 April, Modi telephoned Sharif to thank him for rescuing 11 Indian nationals from war-torn Yemen as well and sending them back home by a special aircraft. The Indians were brought to Karachi from Yemen by the Pakistan navy ship Aslat.

India also said on Thursday that it will never “provoke” a conflict at the border with Pakistan but will not back off if there is any attack, asserting that a befitting reply will be given, the Press Trust of India reported. “India will never provoke conflict by being the first to open fire across the borders but will never back off,” PTI quoted home minister Rajnath Singh as saying. “Our forces will give a befitting reply to shelling and gunfire from across the border.” Singh was speaking in the context of ceasefire violations by Pakistan along the Line of Control(LoC) and International Border, which is guarded by the Border Security Force(BSF).
