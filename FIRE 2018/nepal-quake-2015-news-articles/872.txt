Rains and fresh tremors tonight added misery in Nepal hampering rescuers from wading through tonnes of rubble of flattened homes and buildings to look for survivors of the earthquake that has killed over 2,500 people, including five Indians, and left more than 6,000 others injured.

With no electricity, Kathmandu, the capital of Nepal, looked a ghost town with rains pounding the city, forcing the closure of the airport where chaotic scenes were witnessed with stranded foreign tourists desperate to go home.

“Still raining, adds to the misery. Only consolation is that it may ease the water crisis in some of the shelters,” Nepali Times Editor Kunda Dixit tweeted.

Nepal authorities said Sunday that at least 2,430 people in that country had died in Nepal alone, not including the 18 people that the Nepal Mountaineering Association says died in an earthquake-triggered avalanche on Mount Everest. Another 61 people died from the quake in India and a few in other neighboring countries.

Stepping up relief and rescue operations in quake-hit Nepal, India today deployed over two dozen aircraft and choppers along with nearly 1000 trained personnel and said the situation in the Himalayan nation was “very, very serious”.

A slew of steps have been taken for speedy evacuation of stranded tourists including goodwill visas to foreigners and mobilising of buses and ambulances to bring them by road. Over 1,000 people have been flown from there since yesterday.

Earlier, Prime Minister Narendra Modi held a meeting to review the situation in the quake-hit Nepal where death toll has crossed 22,00 mark. Modi has directed speeding up of efforts to save and evacuate people from Nepal.

Meanwhile, weather department has predicted widespread rains and thundershowers in Nepal which may trigger landslides. The IMD has asked asked people to remain alert.

“Weather Forecasting Centre of Indian Meteorological Department has predicted fairly widespread rain/ thundershower

activity over Nepal during next the 4 hours.

“The activity is most likely to become widespread on April 27 and 28 with the possibility of isolated heavy thunderstorm activity, particularly over eastern part of Nepal,” the Ministry of Earth Science said in a release.

A powerful, magnitude 6.7 aftershock has shaken the Kathmandu area of Nepal a day after the massive earthquake devastated the region, sending people yelling and running for open ground. Tremors were felt in most parts of north and northeast India including Kolkata, Siliguri and Assam. Minutes after the first aftershock, Nepal felt another measuring 5.0 in magnitude.

The US Geological Survey says the aftershock on Sunday registered at a shallow depth of 10 kilometers (6 miles). 1,910 people were killed in Nepal, at least 57 in India, 17 in Tibet and two in Bangladesh. Two Chinese citizens died at the Nepal-China border.
