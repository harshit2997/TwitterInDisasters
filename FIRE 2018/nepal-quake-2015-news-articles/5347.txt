Bungie Raised Over $400k for Nepal Earthquake Relief in One Week
</headline>

<text>
Together with the Destiny community, developer Bungie raised over $400,000 to aid in disaster relief funds for Nepal.

This amount was gathered over the course of one week from the sale of t-shirts and will be donated to Direct Relief, an organization helping with medical treatment in the disaster-torn Kathmandu region.

Bungie has pledged $15 for every shirt sold up to $50,000 between now and Wednesday, May 13. With this, they hope to raise an additional $100,000 in relief funds.

They aren't the first video game company to raise money toward Nepal relief, as Ubisoft also launched a campaign pledging to match the donations to the Canadian Red Cross up to $100,000.

Bungie also recently revealed when the House of Wolves DLC would be going live. Read IGN's Destiny review to learn more about Bungie's multiplayer shooter.
