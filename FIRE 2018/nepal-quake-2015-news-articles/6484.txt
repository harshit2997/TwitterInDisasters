BOISE -- A Boise family was traveling in the Mount Everest region of Nepal when a massive 7.9-magnitude earthquake hit. They're sharing photos of the devastation and rallying support for quake victims.

John Caka met his wife, Nawang, when she was 15 years old. Nawang came to the United States as an exchange student and lived with a family in Utah.

"She happened to come to my little private school in Utah," said John Caka.

The couple dated for years and eventually married in 2009. They made the decision to move to Idaho in 2013 for John's work.

Now raising 21-month-old Jonas, the family planned a trip back to Nepal.

"I really wanted to see my grandma because she is getting really old," said Nawang.

After weeks visiting family high in the Himalayas, the earthquake hit.

"So I just hear it shake and the windows were making a really loud noise, too," said Nawang.

She was napping with Jonas when the shaking started and immediately threw her arms around him. The two rode out the earthquake together in Nawang's family lodge.

Meanwhile, John was hours away on a trek to see Everest.

"I started to hear really, really loud, it was a rumbling thunder and then all of a sudden the whole mountain just started to jump back and forth," he said.

John steadied himself on a narrow yak trail, and once the rumbling stopped, he hiked hours back to where his wife and son were.

"We couldn't really believe that this was happening," he added.

The family was safe, but Nawang's village was destroyed.

"Just literally their lives have crumbled," said John.

With tears in her eyes, Nawang remembers the devastation.

"I just was in shock," she said. "Not just their house. People have lost their loved ones."

Now back in Idaho, the Cakas are urging everyone to keep the Nepali people in their thoughts and prayers.

"Everyone right now is trying to help Nepal and I mean it's going to take a long time to get back to the same place," said Nawang.

But with time and support, Nawang hopes the nation will heal.

"Just help out as much as we can," she added.

Nawang has set up a GoFundMe page to support her home village of Khumjung.
