Looking for some weekend listening? Well, look no further.

Here are the top five Radio Active tracks of the week:

The explosion of the Nova Scotia craft beer scene

Our Radio Active beer columnist Jason Foster recently visited Halifax, where more and more micro-breweries are opening up. He brought Portia Clark a sample to try.





Help for Nepal

Five Edmonton women are joining forces to raise money to rebuild schools in earthquake-ravaged Nepal.

NDP candidate from Maskwacis says she faced racism on the campaign trail

Katherine Swampy spoke to Portia Clark about her experience while campaigning for the NDP in Devon-Drayton Valley.

The mountain turned to mush

When a 7.8 magnitude earthquake rattled Nepal last month, Suru Patel of St. Albert was trekking down a six kilometre path to a base camp on Mount Everest. The quake triggered an avalanche that killed 19 climbers. He is back home in St. Albert. He told his story to Radio Active's Portia Clark.

Catholic trustee won't resign

Catholic school trustee Patricia Grell has roused the ire of her board chair for supporting the parents of a seven-year old transgender student. The student was born a boy but feels like a girl. Her parents say she should be allowed to use the girls' bathroom but Edmonton Catholic Schools say that the student has to use a gender neutral bathroom.

Catholic school board chair Debbie Engel says that trustees usually resign when they publicly oppose decisions made by the board. Grell says she isn't going anywhere.
