Race to rescue quake Britons: Eight Scots missing as Nepal death toll hits 2,500
</headline>

At least eight Scots are missing and up to 70 Britons are feared to have died in the tragedy which struck on Saturday lunchtime near the Himalayas.

The quake, measuring 7.8 on the Richter scale and centred on a region north-west of capital Katmandhu, was the biggest to hit the area in more than 80 years.

The majority of fatalities were reported in Nepal, with deaths also confirmed in India, Tibet, Bangladesh and the Nepal-China border.

Eighteen climbers from different nations perished as base camp was swallowed by an avalanche following Saturday’s quake.

One survivor said Everest “moved” during the terrifying ordeal and another said it was “like an atomic bomb going off”.

Among the Scots unaccounted for is Darren Smith from South Queensferry. The 27-year-old’s sister, Kerry Smith, said the last contact she had with her brother was while he was in Kathmandu.

She believes he left there last Thursday to head for the Annapurna Circuit Trek to do the walk along with his 26-year-old girlfriend Fiona Lamont.

The couple were not with an organised group and Ms Smith believes they would be heading between the towns of Bahundanda and Jagat.

Others Scots who are believed to be missing include Ross Smith, 22, from Castle Douglas, Dumfriesshire, Ann Hardy, 47, from Kirkcaldy, Fife and Archie Rainey, 18, from Glasgow.

However, Matthew Thorne, 36, from Stirling – known as “Buddy” – who was believed to be missing, is now said to have been traced after a social networking profile was updated to read: “Matthew’s family have been notified that he is alive and well and making his way cautiously out the region.”

Meanwhile, Glaswegian Jacqueline Toal, who is in Kathmandu, was also traced safe-and-well after being listed as missing.
