SINGAPORE - Two Republic of Singapore Air Force (RSAF) C-130 aircraft carrying sustenance and medical supplies departed for Nepal's capital Kathmandu on Thursday morning, the Ministry of Defence (Mindef) said in a statement.

Six Singapore Armed Forces (SAF) personnel from the Changi Regional Humanitarian Assistance and Disaster Relief Coordination Centre (RHCC) and eight personnel from the Royal Brunei Armed Forces (RBAF) were on board the planes which took off at 5am and 11am.

The two armed forces are providing aid to Nepal in the wake of an earthquake with magnitude 7.8 which shook the country on April 25. The death toll has exceeded 5,000.

Mindef said that the additional RHCC personnel will join the team that is already on the ground assisting the Nepalese disaster management authorities and military in coordinating the relief effort.

The RBAF personnel will join the SAF medical team deployed to Gokarna town. Both armed forces will work alongside in providing medical assistance to the earthquake victims there.

"The deployment of RBAF personnel was coordinated through the Brunei international liaison officer to the RHCC, and demonstrates the excellent defence ties between the SAF and RBAF," Mindef said.
