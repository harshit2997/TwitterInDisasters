A Nepalese man killed his Indian roommate in Kuwait after the victim made fun of the victims of a devastating earthquake in Nepal during a drinking session at night.



The Arabic language daily 'Al Anba' said the Nepalese told police he waited for the Indian to go to bed before stabbing him many times.



“He confessed to the crime after he was arrested on the next day. He told police that he decided to kill the Indian after he started to make fund of the quake victims in his country,” the paper said.
