THE Rotary Club of Ledbury along with other clubs around the region has joined the campaign to help those affected by the dreadful earthquake in Nepal. Emergency Shelter survival boxes have already been dispatched and these instantly provide vulnerable families with emergency shelter and vital aid, until food and other supplies can reach them. The boxes which cost approximately Â£600 each are purchased in the UK so that all monies are spent in ensuring aid is sent where it is most needed. The Rotary Club of Ledbury were in the town May 2, to hold a major collection, which will be used to fund more boxes. Spokesperson Jan long said; "Ledbury people have a reputation for their compassion and generosity and we hope that they will help us to help others". The Shelter boxes contain specially designed tents and numerous other items including thermal blankets, water filtration units, cooking equipment, tools and mosquito nets and well as items for children.
