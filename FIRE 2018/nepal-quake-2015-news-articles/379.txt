It is being reported that at least eleven Irish citizens are trapped in Nepal following a devastating earthquake earlier today.

The group, understood to be from Co Wexford, left for Nepal on Friday morning.

It contains Riverchapel parish priest Fr Tom Dalton and local businesswoman Catherine Jordan.

It is believed the group had just landed in the country and were close to the airport in Kathmandu when the earthquake occured.

The devastating quake measuring 7.9 magnitude struck west of the ancient Nepali capital of Kathmandu today, killing 876 people and injuring hundreds of others, doctors and witnesses said.

The most powerful quake to hit the impoverished Himalayan nation in 81 years triggered an avalanche on Mount Everest, the world's highest mountain, sparking fears that climbers are among the dead.
