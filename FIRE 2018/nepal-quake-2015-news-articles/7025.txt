Mackenzie Higgins guides a UH-1Y Huey for takeoff at the Tribhuvan International Airport in Kathmandu, Nepal, May 5. Marines with Marine Light Attack Helicopter Squadron 469 and Marine Medium Tilt Rotor Squadron 262 carried supplies in a UH-1Y Huey and MV-22 Ospreys to Charikot, Nepal. The supplies will provide Nepalese people with shelter after a 7.8 magnitude earthquake struck central Nepal, April 25, causing fatalities, injuries and significant damage. The government of Nepal declared a state of emergency and requested international assistance. The U.S. military, at the direction of the U.S. Agency for International Development, will continue to support Nepal as needed. HMLA-469 and VMM-262 are attached to Marine Aircraft Group 36, 1st Marine Aircraft Wing, III Marine Expeditionary Force. Higgins is a UH-1Y crew chief with HMLA-469 from Pala Way, California.

CHARIKOT, Nepal - The search continues for six U.S. Marines and two Nepalese service members who were aboard a missing UH-1Y Huey helicopter. The aircraft went missing May 12 near Charikot, Nepal, while conducting rescue and recovery operations following the earthquakes that occurred earlier that day. The Huey was flying in support of Joint Task Force 505 supporting Operation Sahayogi Haat.



Finding the missing service members is priority, but support to Nepal as they deal with the aftermath of the recent quakes continues. Two UH-1Y Hueys with Marine Light Attack Helicopter Squadron 469, and two MV-22B Ospreys with Marine Medium Tiltrotor Squadron 262, flew approximately 29 flight hours yesterday.



The two Hueys, whose priority was the rescue and recovery of the missing service members, evacuated 14 Nepalese locals affected by the recent earthquakes yesterday. Additionally, the Ospreyâ€™s supported the movement of search and rescue teams looking for survivors of the 12 May earthquake.



The Indian and Nepalese militaries continue to provide support to the search for the missing service members.



The names and identities of the personnel on board the missing UH-1Y Huey are being withheld due to the unknown status of the service members and to allow for proper notification of next of kin for all the service members.



Additional details will be provided as they become available.
