Firsthand knowledge of Nepal raises fears

Belinda Bow, a 3 Angels Nepal ambassador, was in Nepal in 2014 to film Latitude, a documentary about human trafficking.

BELINDA Bow’s heart sank when she learnt of the Nepal earthquake on Saturday.

The Redhead businesswoman’s first thoughts were for all the children and volunteers she has worked with as part of 3 Angels Nepal.

She joined a group of Novocastrians on a trip to Nepal in March 2014 to film Latitude, a documentary about human trafficking.

‘‘The images I have seen are of complete devastation. It’s terrible, particularly in Kathmandu,’’ Ms Bow, a 3 Angels Nepal ambassador said.

‘‘We have been in touch with some of our friends, who are safe. But there are likely to be aftershocks.’’

Ms Bow said the devastation would be compounded by the country’s haphazard building codes.

‘‘They tend to use small parcels of land and build upwards when they can afford to; it’s pretty frightening,’’ Ms Bow said.

‘‘It doesn’t take much movement for the whole thing to collapse and that creates a domino effect.’’

The maze-like network of streets around Kathmandu is making it more difficult to find survivors.

‘‘It’s going to be very difficult to find people because the buildings are so close together. There are laneways everywhere,’’ she said.

The Nepali-Indian border is more than 1600kilometres long. India surrounds the country on three sides while China borders the country on the north.

An estimated 54 Nepali girls disappear across the border each day destined for brothels in Mumbai, Bangalore, Delhi, Siliguri and Kolkata.

Many of the trafficked women are from poor, rural regions.

Their families allow them to be taken away on the false pretence of wealthy marriages or well-paid employment.

In addition to educating young woman, 3 Angels also helps border patrols to stop the trafficking.
