Nepal earthquake: Brisbane nurse describes terror as new quakes shake region
</headline>

BRISBANE nurse Ruth Jebb has described the terror of being caught in Nepal’s latest deadly earthquakes.

The experienced aid worker, who has flown to the disaster-stricken nation to coordinate the health response, had just touched down in Kathmandu and was in a taxi en route to the Red Cross headquarters last night when the magnitude-7.4 earthquake struck.

“The scariest moment I have had in a long while,” Ms Jebb told The Courier-Mail in an email.

“Safe and sound though and trying my best to get to work.”

A magnitude 6.3 quake and aftershocks followed about 30 minutes later.

Ms Jebb left Brisbane late Monday night to coordinate the disease prevention and surveillance efforts in the aftermath of the magnitude-7.8 earthquake that killed more than 8000 people on April 25.

The official death toll of the latest tremblors is 48 but expected to rise quickly today after emergency teams arrive at the most stricken villages west of Kathmandu.

“The need here is even more so after today,” said Ms Jebb, an emergency clinical nurse consultant at Princess Alexandra Hospital.
