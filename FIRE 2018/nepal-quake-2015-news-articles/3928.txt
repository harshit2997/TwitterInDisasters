Himalayan tragedy: Adopt villages, kids in Nepal, Akhilesh Yadav tells SP leaders

SP workers undertake relief operations in Nepal.

Chief Minister Akhilesh Yadav has asked a group of party leaders to adopt villages and children as part of a rebuilding exercise in quake-hit Nepal. A team of 50 party workers led by youth brigade leaders are camping in the neighbouring country to carry out relief work.

Sources said Akhilesh, too, is likely to visit Nepal in coming days after the situation improves. Akhilesh shares good relationship with Nepal President Ram Baran Yadav and a team of the country’s leaders had visited Lucknow when Akhilesh took charge as the CM in 2012. He had also paid a two-day visit to Nepal last year.

“We are working here for past four days. There are places where relief material has not reached yet. We have briefed the CM about several villages that have been totally devastated with high number of casualties. The CM has asked us to adopt and rebuild at least one village, adopt children who have lost their parents and take care of their upbringing,” said Sunil Singh Yadav, party’s state executive member and currently leading the team of workers in Nepal.

For this, SP leaders are short-listing villages. “We went to Budhana Pamang village which is nearly 18 kilometres from Kathmandu. It is completely ruined and we were the first to reach there with relief material. We have spoken to the villagers. Soon, we will chalk out a plan to rebuild the houses there,” Dr Imran Idris, a doctor who is part of the SP team, told The Indian Express over phone from Nepal.

As per the plan worked out by the SP, construction material will be arranged from bordering UP districts. Since a large number of Nepal citizens live in UP, the children, following their guardians’ permission, will be admitted in schools in UP under their patronage. Relief materials to help locals restart their lives will also be provided.

“We are not concerned about the money as there are many in our party who are ready to contribute. After the relief material exercise is over, it will take years to rebuild Nepal and we can contribute with our small share in it,” Ajit Pratap Singh, an MBA and part of the SP team, said.
