Georgia Relief Agencies Respond To Nepal Earthquake

UPDATE 2 (4/27 11:15am):

Habitat for Humanity is also sending assistance to Nepal. The Atlanta-based housing charity is sending 20,000 emergency shelter kits to the country. Habitat says it will also send engineers and engineering students to look at houses damaged by the quake. “Based on our assessment, Habitat will either construct transitional (temporary) shelters or move immediately into new home (core) construction,” Habitat CEO Jonathan Reckford said in a statement.

The charity had already selected Nepal for its annual work project featuring Jimmy and Rosalynn Carter. Reckford says it’s too early to know what impact the quake will have on the project.

UPDATE (4/27 10:30am):

An Atlanta man is missing in Nepal. The Atlanta Journal-Constitution reports 71-year-old Martin Emanuel was on a trekking expedition in a national park north of Kathmandu when the quake hit Saturday. He was travelling with a local guide. Family members say they haven’t heard from Emanuel since last Thursday.

His wife says she’s optimistic Emanuel is alive. Communication has been difficult in Nepal, following the earthquake.

Meanwhile, FOX5 reports that members of Georgia's Nepalese community held a vigil for quake victims in Lilburn Sunday night.

EARLIER:

Two Georgia-based agencies are on the ground in Nepal, following Saturday’s 7.9 magnitude earthquake.

Atlanta-based CARE had 150 staff in country before the quake. Now, it’s bringing in additional staff to help more than 75,000 Nepalese with everything from temporary shelter to water purification.

“More than 40,000 people are getting treatment in hospital, but there is no room inside the hospitals,” Santosh Sharma, CARE’s emergency response coordinator in Kathmandu said in a statement. “Many are getting treated in the compound of the hospital. Medical supplies are an urgent need. All of the particularly vulnerable – children, breastfeeding mothers, people with chronic diseases – they have been suffering a lot. It’s essential to get help to these people as quickly as we can.”

MAP International, a Christian relief agency based in Brunswick, is airlifting medicines to Nepal, including antibiotics and wound care items. “Our first shipment of critical medicines is already underway and will provide 10,000 people with medical aid for 90 days,” MAP’s Senior Medicines Officer Kipp Branch said in a statement.
