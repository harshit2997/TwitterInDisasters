</headline>

<text>
Prime Minister Sushil Koirala today appealed to Nepalese people to donate blood as hospitals badly needed it to treat more than 6,000 people injured in the killer quake.



Koirala, after chairing a cabinet meeting, also asked the bussinessmen to open big departmental stores to ease food supplies shortage.



The government has directed all pharmacies near hospitals to operate normally.Defying the government's directives will attract stern action, according to myrepublica.Com.Following the meeting, the government also appealed for contributions to the Prime Minister's Disaster Relief Fund.Racing against time, rescuers today waded through tonnes of rubble of flattened homes and buildings in Nepal to look for survivors of the earthquake that has killed over 2,350 people, including five Indians, and left more than 6,000 others injured.
