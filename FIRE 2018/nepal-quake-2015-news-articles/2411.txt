20 Images That Show That Nepal Isn't Giving Up
</headline>

<text>
Nepal is witnessing the worst earthquakes series it has witnessed in the last eight decades. On April 25, a massive earthquake measuring 7.8 on the Richter scale hit the Himalayan country with a epicentre around 34 km ESE of Lamjung. With more than 30 aftershocks in the first 24 hours followed by yet another quake measuring 6.7 on April 26, a sense of despair spread through the capital city of Kathmandu leaving residents terrified and running helter-skelter for help. The quake left behind vast trail of devastation. Each time the city shuddered with aftershocks, thousands from across the world felt the urge to join those in pain.

With so much loss of life, property and history, Nepal is struggling to come to terms with the large-scale devastation but there is still hope from an otherwise grim and morbid setup. People from all walks of life, irrespective of nationalities, caste and creed have come together to provide comfort in times of pain.

As the Himalayan nation tries to rebuild itself bit by bit, here are some images that will restore people’s faith in the strongest human emotion ‘Hope’.
