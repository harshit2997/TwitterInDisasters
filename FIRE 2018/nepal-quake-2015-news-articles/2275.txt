A vigil will be held in Ashford tonight to pay respects to the victims of the Nepal earthquake disaster.

The event has been organised by hospital worker Kamala Gurung, from the town, and will take place in Victoria Park, off Jemmett Road, at 6pm.

Members of the Nepalese community will gather at the park to light candles and pray for those who have died, been injured or affected by the catastrophic earthquake.

The estimated death toll has risen past 3,600 after the quake struck on Saturday morning, police in Nepal said.

A further 6,500 are thought to be injured as the rescue effort gets under way.

The 7.8 magnitude earthquake destroyed homes, businesses and temples in the capital of Kathmandu. Another 53 are believed to have died in India and 17 in Tibet.

Fears are growing for a Kent man in Nepal who has not been heard from since the earthquake hit.

The family of Matt Carapiet, 23, from Peverel Drive, Bearsted, have appealed for him to get in touch and confirm he is safe.
