Seventeen people are reported to have been killed in the Tibet Autonomous Region in Southwest China by the 8.1 magnitude earthquake that hit Nepal Saturday afternoon.



Four are confirmed as missing, while at least 55 others are injured. The counties of Nyalam and Gyirong in Xigaze Prefecture are among the hardest hit areas.



Rescuers are braving heavy snow and rain to reach places that have been cut off by landslides. The first batch of disaster relief materials is en route to Xigaze.



They include 1,000 cotton quilts, 1,000 mattresses, 300 tents, 100 generators, 200 tons of cooking oil, and three days' food for 2,000 people. The supplies are set to arrive by noon today. Temporary shelters will be set up.

17 people are reported to have been killed by the quake in the Tibet Autonomous Region in Southwest China.
