India sent 135 people from their emergency response team along with 18 tons of supplies. The Indian Air Force helped to evacuate people to safety from Kathmandu. Singapore is sending 55 people in a rescue team and $100,000. Israel told Nepal the government is preparing rescue and humanitarian teams. Norway pledged $3.9 million. Pakistan opened a field hospital and sent 2,000 meals. The British Red Cross immediately dispatched teams to help right after the earthquake hit.
