TBILISI, April 25 (Xinhua)-- President of Georgia Giorgi Margvelashvili on Saturday expressed his deep sorrow to the people of Nepal over the heavy losses of lives in the powerful earthquakes that struck parts of the Asian nation Saturday.

"I would like to express my deepest sorrow over the Nepal tragedy, which killed more than 600 people. I offer my condolences to the families of those deceased and the people of Nepal," Margvelashvili declared in a statement.

Georgian Prime Minister Irakli Gharibashvili also expressed his condolences to the Nepalese people.

Twin powerful earthquakes shook Nepal Saturday, leaving more than 700 people dead in the country. The quake also strongly jolted the neighboring regions in China's Tibet Autonomous Region. A total of 13 people were killed and another four remain missing in Tibet, local authorities said.

According to Georgian Embassy to India, which also covers Nepal, there were no reports of Georgian civilians injured or killed in Saturday's earthquakes.
