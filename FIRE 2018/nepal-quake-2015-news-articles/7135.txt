Geologists in Nepal have warned that repeated aftershocks following the devastating April 25 earthquake, pose serious threats to around 20 glaciers leading to a potential outburst.

According to a report published on Monday in Kantipur daily, experts warned locals living in lower riparian areas of these glaciers near Mount Everest should remain vigil.

Till Sunday evening, over 160 aftershocks were recorded by Nepal's National Seismological Record Centre.

Such repeated aftershocks made the land around the glaciers very vulnerable and weak, Nepal University's Centre for Meteorology and Hydrology chief, Rijan Bhaktha Kayastha said.

Among the 20 vulnerable glaciers situated in quake risk areas, three glacial lakes -- Thulagi, Tsho Rolpa and Imja -- could pose a serious threat, he said.

State owned department of hydrology and meteorology has said that it will conduct field study at upper Himalayan region to asses the situation in the area.

Satellite images taken by the department showed that water level in these glaciers was intact but it needs further field study.
