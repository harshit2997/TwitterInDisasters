Aussie aid worker describes terror of living through Nepal’s second quake

13/05/2015

An Australian aid worker who lived through yesterday's powerful earthquake has described the moment she fled in fear for her life.

Save the Children's Sarah Ireland, a veteran of humanitarian responses in places like Iraq and Myanmar, was at the Nepalese Department of Education when the powerful quake struck. She said, "It was very scary and definitely the largest quake I've experienced. Thankfully we all survived, so the focus quickly swung back to the relief effort and getting on with the job of helping those made homeless by the two quakes that have now hit Nepal."

"Just days ago a Save the Children relief flight carrying 44 tonnes of tarpaulins, tents, hygiene kits, household kits and other supplies left Manila and has now arrived in Nepal, so we are well placed to scale up our response. With the monsoon rains due in a matter of weeks, we must respond to people's needs as quickly as possible," added Ms Ireland.

Ms Ireland said shelter was a huge need in Nepal after the quakes damaged or destroyed over 540,000 homes, displacing around 2.8 million people.

"Tuesday's earthquake has meant that many families are back to sleeping outside for fear of falling debris from buildings or further aftershocks. With the monsoon rains weeks away, and the possibility of more damage from this latest strong aftershock, yesterday's earthquake has reinforced the pressing need for durable and long-lasting shelter solutions."

Ms Ireland also expressed concern for the psychological welfare of children in Nepal whom have lived through two terrible earthquakes and multiple aftershocks. "Many children were already suffering from the disruption, loss and trauma caused by the first earthquake, however the strength of Tuesday's quake, plus additional damage to homes and buildings, reinforces the need for psychosocial support through the set-up of child friendly spaces or similar programs, giving children the support they need now and to mitigate the possible long-lasting psychological and social impact."

Save the Children has so far reached 67,000 people in quake affected Nepal, distributing vital items including tarpaulins and hygiene kits, and working to establish mobile health clinics to provide basic primary health care.
