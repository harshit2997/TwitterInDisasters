Melbourne aid worker Jessica Letch caught up in second Nepal earthquake

MELBOURNE aid worker Jessica Letch barely felt her feet hit the ground as she ran to safety when a second major earthquake struck Nepal on Tuesday.

The Red Cross aid was at a meeting in a government building in Kathmandu that began to shake under what proved to be a 7.3-magnitude tremor.

Ms Letch had initially thought the tremor was an aftershock to last month’s 7.8-magnitude earthquake, which killed more than 8000 people, but quickly realised she was wrong.

“There was a moment where everybody paused and felt the wobbling,” she said from Nepal.

“When we realised it was sustaining and getting stronger there was this wave of reaction and everybody leapt from their seats, and chairs were overturned. To be honest I didn’t feel a lot of the earthquake because my feet hardly hit the ground we were all rushing to get out the door.”

Ms Letch travelled to Kathmandu in the aftermath of the quake that devastated the region on April 25.

The building she had been working in on Tuesday was already structurally affected.

“It was the only meeting room left as so many of the other spaces had been destroyed by the (April 25) earthquake,” she said.

The experienced relief worker said people in Kathmandu are still sleeping in tents with Tuesday’s tremor compounding concerns.

“It’s not been the same since the first earthquake and this has deepened that fear and anxiety,” Ms Letch said.

“I have colleagues who are still sleeping outside after the first earthquake and one who is hosting nine families.”

Foreign Affairs Minister Julie Bishop said Australia would continue to help the region.

“Australia is providing more than $20 million in assistance to support the people of Nepal following the 25 April earthquake. In addition, two ADF C-17 aircraft delivered 15 tonnes of humanitarian relief and 31 Australian government officials travelled to Nepal and Bangkok to assist in Australia’s humanitarian and consular response,” Ms Bishop said.

“We will continue to engage closely with the government of Nepal and other partners to determine any further needs relating to this latest earthquake.”

Authorities still hold grave concerns for an Australian man who went missing in the Langtang region afterlast month’s earthquake.

Australians have been advised to reconsider travel to Nepal while relief and recovery efforts continue.
