As millions of quake-hit people across various parts of the country, including the Capital city, are bearing the brunt of the April 25 earthquake, a group of Muslim people have come forth to the aid of people (humanity), disregarding the religious differences.

The Muslim people from Balkawa, Mahanaur in Siraha district, have sent some relief materials to the quake-hit people in Kathmandu on Sunday evening.

The 47 sacks of relief materials sent by the Muslim community here include food items, 35 tents and 33 blankets among others, according to a local Pappu Khan.

Khan believed that the relief materials, collected by some Muslim youths like him from door-to-door collection, will help the distraught victims to some extent. RSS
