KATHMANDU, Nepal — Authorities in Nepal on Wednesday raised the death toll from a magnitude 7.3 aftershock to 91 people as troops combed a remote district northeast of Kathmandu for a U.S. military helicopter that was missing with eight people aboard.

More than 2,400 were injured in the quake that occurred Tuesday afternoon, the largest of a series of aftershocks centered in Nepal since an enormous April 25 temblor, according to police officials.

An additional 17 people died in northern India, according to local news reports, 16 of them in the state of Bihar.

U.S. military officials said a UH-1Y Huey aircraft, which was participating in relief operations, went missing Tuesday while delivering aid and retrieving casualties from the Charikot area, near the quake's epicenter. The aircraft was carrying six U.S. service members and two Nepalese soldiers, said Capt. Cassandra M. Gesecki, spokeswoman for the 3rd Marine Expeditionary Brigade.

The aircraft belonged to Marine Light Attack Helicopter Squadron 469, based at Camp Pendleton, Calif.

The Nepali army was told that the helicopter may have come down in a river, and had mobilized 400 soldiers to aid in the search, a Nepalese army official told Reuters news agency.

However, Gesecki said reports that the helicopter had been found were “just rumors.”

“There's been no confirmed communication” with the aircraft, she said, adding that there was no indication it had crashed.

Tuesday's earthquake was centered 47 miles northeast of Kathmandu close to the Chinese border, according to the U.S. Geological Survey. It unleashed fresh landslides in parts of northern Nepal still recovering from the magnitude 7.8 April 25 tremor, which killed more than 8,150 people and flattened or damaged hundreds of thousands of buildings nationwide.

Many families fled their homes Tuesday night and slept in open fields in Kathmandu and elsewhere. In the Tudikhel area of Kathmandu, 11-year-old Bhim Magar awoke Wednesday to find that many of his older family members had gone to fetch belongings from their house, believing they would not return there for several days.

“We were rolling on the ground because it was shaking so violently,” the boy recalled.
