The death toll quickly climbed to more than 1,400 Saturday in the aftermath of the devastating earthquake in Nepal that left much of the country's capital city of Kathmandu in ruins, caused avalanches on Mt. Everest 100 miles away and shook people and structures as far away as India, Tibet and Bangladesh.

The 7.8 magnitude quake struck about 50 miles outside Kathmandu Saturday, and by late Saturday, the death toll from the quake had topped 1,400, with heavy damage to the historic center of Kathmandu where buildings collapsed and crushed countless people inside them.

Another 34 people died in India, according to officials there.

The historic Dharahara tower, which had been a landmark of Kathmandu since it was built in 1832, collapsed during Saturday's earthquake, trapping an estimated 200 people under the rubble.

The avalanches triggered on the world's highest mountain by the high-powered quake killed eight people and injured many more. Nepalese tourism board officials said portions of the base camp used by hundreds of climbers to ascend Mount Everest were covered by the avalanche and the toll could include climbers and their guides, known as Sherpas.

While accounts could not be verified, friends and family of climbers on the mountain took to Twitter to seek information and support.

"Please. Anyone who is awake, please pray for my little brother Zachary who is on Mt Everest, I'd appreciate every prayer you have spare," tweeted Hugh Sheridan, an Australian actor and television personality.

Late Saturday, Secretary of State John Kerry issued a statement of grief for Nepal over the tragedy, and said the U.S. was dispatching assistance.

"We are working closely with the government of Nepal to provide assistance and support. [U.S. Ambassador to Nepal Peter] Bodde has issued a disaster declaration in order to immediately release an initial $1 million for humanitarian assistance. USAID is preparing to deploy a Disaster Assistance Response Team and is activating an Urban Search and Rescue Team to accompany disaster experts and assist with assessments of the situation," Kerry said.

On Saturday Israeli Prime Minster Benjamin Netanyahu also said his country would send a search and rescue team, and follow up with another plane to evacuate Israelis who were living or vacationing there.
