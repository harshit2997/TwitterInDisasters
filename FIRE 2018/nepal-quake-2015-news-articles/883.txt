Death Toll from Nepal Quake Rises to More Than 1,000



KATHMANDU  The death toll from the magnitude-7.8 earthquake that struck the Himalayan nation of Nepal on Saturday has risen above 1,000, according to officials, who have been updating the count throughout the day and say it will certainly climb further.



A total of 1,170 people are confirmed dead, most of them in the countrys central valley, where Kathmandu is located, sources with the Interior Ministrys National Emergency Operation Center told Efe.



Officials have not yet indicated how many were injured in the temblor, which also was felt in China, where 13 people died, and in India, where the death toll in listed at 34.



Rescue workers, meanwhile, continue to comb through the rubble of collapsed buildings in search of survivors, while authorities attempt to gauge the full extent of the damage nationwide.



Thousands of people in Kathmandu remain in the streets and plan to spend the night outdoors out of fear that aftershocks could bring down their homes.



Expressions of solidarity poured in from leaders around the world, including Spanish King Felipe VI and Queen Letizia, who sent a condolence telegram to Nepals president, Ram Baran Yadav.



Among the fatalities were at least 10 foreign climbers who died on Mount Everest, a Nepalese Tourism Ministry source told Efe.



Spanish climber and photographer Javier Camacho Gimenez, who was at the base camp of Mount Lhotse, also located in the Himalayas and the worlds fourth-highest peak, told Efe by phone that the earthquake caused an avalanche on Mount Pumori that buried some base camps where Chinese and Japanese mountaineers were staying.



The earthquake, which struck shortly before noon and whose epicenter was located some 80 kilometers (50 miles) northwest of Kathmandu, is being called the worst in Nepals recent history and one of the most powerful in the past decade in the region.
