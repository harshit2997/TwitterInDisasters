BC Red Cross worker on the way to Nepal says witnessing devastation never gets easier

VANCOUVER (NEWS1130) – The BC Red Cross is sending relief aid to the most devastated regions of Nepal.

Lise-Anne Pierce is a veteran when it comes to disaster zones, most recently travelling to Haiti after the major earthquake in 2010. Now she’s on her way to Kathmandu to help provide shelter for displaced people, and she’s expecting the worst.

“By nature, a disaster is chaotic and difficult, so in the early days, it makes sorting out where the needs are and who’s most at need and all the assessment very diffcult,” she says. “Time is ticking and the urgency to be able to provide people with basic shelter and that safety and security is very important – water and sanitation is an essential.”

Pierce’s role with the Red Cross is coordinating all the agencies who are providing things like tents and tarps in a well-organized manner.

She emphasizes it’s essential to provide relief to those who are most devastated by the disaster. “Health care is a major consideration at this point.”

Before hitting the ground in Nepal, Pierce has the arduous task of preparing herself emotionally for what she’ll see when she arrives. She says witnessing devastation never gets easier, but her family is a great support for her.

“Beforehand, it’s always a little bit nerve-wracking to know what you’re going to face and how you’re going to cope – you can never really tell. I work for an organization that trains us really well and there are lots of checks and balances in place, meeting with support for debriefing and while I’m on the ground there are lots of people to talk to.”

“The team is close-knit and we support each other really well, and when we get home, there’s lots of support for us there too.”

The Red Cross needs donations, and it’s easy for you to help. Pierce says they’re looking for financial contributions, as it’s easier and quicker than transporting food and water donations from BC.

“British Columbians are always generous and very supportive and we’re very grateful for that,” she tells us.
