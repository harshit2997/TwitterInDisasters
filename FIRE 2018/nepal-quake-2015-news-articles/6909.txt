Save the Children have released a statement saying that the reports claiming Cristiano Ronaldo donated $7.8m for victims of Nepal earthquake victims

Contrary to reports, Real Madrid star, Cristiano Ronaldo did not donate any money to earthquake victims in Nepal.

French magazine, So Foot, reported that the current Ballon d'Or holder donated the sum of $7.8m to aid survivors of the earthquake in Nepal through the Save the Children charity.

Save the Children have however revealed that that they did not receive any donation for the player.

"The global ambassador for Save the Children, Cristiano Ronaldo, has used his voice and his global visibility to raise awareness of the problems faced by the most vulnerable children around the world, including those affected by the earthquake in Nepal," the charity said in a statement.

"The latest information on the donation of Cristiano Ronaldo to the emergency response of Save the Children in Nepal is false. After the second earthquake, which has brought further devastation to the country, the NGO wants to thank Cristiano Ronaldo and other influential people for their support in publicising the situation facing children and families in Nepal."
