Patna: At least 150 Indians who reached Indian border at Raxaul from Nepal Monday morning were sent to their homes by different trains and 10 buses were dispatched to Pokhra in the neighbouring country by Bihar government for transporting back stranded citizens.

"The state government has facilitated journey of 150 people by trains to different locations who reached Raxaul by road from Nepal this morning," Principal Secretary Disaster Management department Vyas Jee told PTI.

He said the state government had sent 10 buses to Pokhra to bring back stranded Indians. Five more buses would go there soon for the purpose.

Meanwhile, Chief Minister Nitish Kumar is taking stock of situation in the state as the quake has claimed 51 lives and left 173 injured and issuing necessary direction to officials, Chief Minister Office said.

As per CM order, all schools and colleges in the state were closed for today and tomorrow in view of the tense situation.

A report from Motihari, headquarters of East Champaran district along Indo-Nepal border which has suffered the maximum casualty in Bihar in the quake, District Magistrate Bharat Kumar Dubey and Superintendent of Police Sunil Kumar are in Raxaul to monitor facilities in relief camps there.

District Public Relation Officer Madhusudan Prasad said police, magistrates and team of doctors were working round the clock in relief camps in Raxaul.

In Sitamarhi, the district administration has arranged water and generator sets in open space in Dumra airport ground, Raghunath Jha school compound among others for the people who have been taking shelter there.

About 200 patients have been shifted from Emergency, Surgical and Orthopaedic wards of Darbhanga Medical College and Hospital (DMCH) to other hospitals in the town as the building is old and not in good condition, District Magistrate Kumar Ravi said.

Chief Minister Nitish Kumar took a round of various parks and historic Gandhi maidan till late last night to be with citizens who have taken shelter there out of fear of quake. He directed administration to make proper arrangements for water and electricity in these structures for the people.
