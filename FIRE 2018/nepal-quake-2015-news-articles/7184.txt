new zealand engineers to assess nepal quake damage

Wellington: A team of engineers from New Zealand will visit Nepal to assess the destruction caused by the April 25 earthquake, Foreign Minister Murray McCully said on Monday.

"The Nepalese government has requested assistance from New Zealand experts with damage assessments of public infrastructure, including government buildings and hospitals," Xinhua news agency quoted McCully as saying.

"Four New Zealand engineers, with considerable experience in earthquake strengthening, have volunteered their time and are en route to Nepal," he said.

"This group of engineers will be in Kathmandu for a week. In addition to undertaking damage assessments, they will also help determine whether a larger contingent of 10 to 12 engineers is required," the minister added.

The New Zealand government has already given a financial aid of $1.48 million to Nepal.
