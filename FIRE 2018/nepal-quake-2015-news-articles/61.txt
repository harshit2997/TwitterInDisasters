New Delhi: As many as four aircraft including a C-130 plane carrying three tonnes of relief supplies and a 40-member rescue team were on Saturday pressed into service to assist Nepal after it suffered a devastating earthquake in which hundreds of people have been killed.



While two C17 globemasters took off from Hindon airbase, one aircraft was being sent from Bhatinda, Foreign Secretary S Jaishankar told reporters.



The relief supplies include tents and blankets as asked by the Nepalese government, he said, noting that in the meeting chaired by Prime Minister Narendra Modi, the message was very strong that “we should do whatever possible to help Nepal”.



Similarly, Pakistan Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif extended all assistance to India and Nepal. Sharif offered condolences and help besides instructing its Missions in the two countries to approach their respective host governments to ascertain the damages caused and the requirement of relief assistance.
