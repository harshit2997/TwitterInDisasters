A baby girl born at a field hospital set up in quake-hit Kathmandu by the Indian Army has been named Bharti by her mother to express her love for India.



The baby's mother, Bhawana Sapkota Pudasaini, was initially admitted at the Kathmandu Medical college, but after the fresh quake on May 12 hit the Himalayan nation, she was was shifted to Sinamangal Indian Army Field Hospital where she delivered the girl child yesterday, army officials said.



The mother has named the baby "Bharti" to express her love and respect for India, the officials said.The entire field hospital community celebrated the birth of the baby girl together with the members of Kathmandu Medical College.Since the hospital was already preoccupied with earthquake victims and also because the building was not safe the doctors asked her delivery to be done at the Indian Army field hospital.The death toll from Tuesday's 7.3-magnitude temblor rose to 117. The powerful quake struck the Himalayan nation just when it had begun to rebuild itself following the devastation from the monster temblor less than three weeks ago.Over 200 aftershocks were recorded measuring 4 or more magnitude after the devastating April 25 earthquake that killed more than 8,000 people across Nepal.
