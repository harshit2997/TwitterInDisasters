China's representative to the United Nations has called for sustained international support and assistance for disaster relief and recovery in Nepal.

Liu Jieyi said the Chinese government has mobilized more than 40 helicopters and airplanes to deliver 650 tons of supplies to Nepal.

Following the quake on Tuesday, the Chinese government announced another batch of emergency aid worth a total of 13 million US dollars. This is now being prepared and will reach disaster-stricken areas as soon as possible.
