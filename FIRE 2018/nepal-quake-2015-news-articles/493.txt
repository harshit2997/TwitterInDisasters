The government is sending $1 million ($1.07 billion) of emergency funds to help Nepal after a devastating earthquake there killed more than 2,000 people, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs said, Sunday.

Three Koreans were hurt in the tragedy, the ministry added.

The ministry announced in a statement that Korea gave its deep condolences and sympathy to Nepal and its people.

"The government also plans to actively consider dispatching emergency relief measures," the statement said.

On Saturday, the magnitude-7.8 earthquake ripped through large swathes of the Himalayan country and the death toll is expected to rise. The powerful tremor also sent aftershocks through northern India, and caused an avalanche on Mount Everest.

Among the injured Koreans, one was working for a Korean company participating in a hydroelectric power plant construction project 70 kilometers north of Kathmandu, according to the ministry.

The two others were traveling in Syabrubesi.

The worker's injury is not life-threatening, but one of the two tourists was seriously hurt.

The ministry has set up an emergency team to check if there are additional injuries among Koreans. The ministry said that it is aware of some 650 Koreans in Nepal, with a number of tourists visiting there.

Separately, the Korean Red Cross announced later in the day that it has decided to donate $100,000 for the quake-stricken country, along with thousands of blankets and emergency kits.

The charity organization also launched fundraising on- and offline from the day it occurred.

The international community is rushing to help the country in the aftermath of the earthquake, Nepal's worst in 81 years.

The U.S. government has pledged $1 million in immediate assistance to Nepal, also dispatching a disaster response team there. China also sent a search and rescue team, comprised of 62 members and six dogs.

The Canadian government has pledged $5 million and Sri Lanka and Pakistan are also offering medical aid.
