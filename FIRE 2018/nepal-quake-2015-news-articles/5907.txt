Read on for article

IsraAID’s Search and Rescue Team (SAR) in Kathmandu has rescued a young woman five days after a catastrophic hit Nepal.

Krishna Devi Khadka had been trapped in a hotel for five days in an air pocket covered by a body.

The complicated extraction took many hours, with IsraAID’s SAR team leading international efforts that included SAR teams from France, Norway, and Nepal. When the rescuers reached her, a medical team from IsraAID’s Mexico-based partner CADENA set-up an IV drip and stabilise Ms. Khadka.

When the young woman was finally extracted and carried away to a waiting ambulance, the large crowd which had gathered found hope that others may yet be alive.

As Ms. Khadka was rushed to hospital, the team returned to the building as signs of a potential second survivor were felt.

So far, the international non-governmental aid agency “IsraAID” has sent search & rescue (SAR) and medical teams to Nepal to assist the victims of the recent earthquake.
