KATHMANDU - Thousands are fleeing the Nepalese capital as rumors of shortage of food and water are spreading while the outcome of home and international relief operations remains uncertain, said diplomatic sources here Wednesday.

The death toll from the 7.9-magnitude quake last weekend now stood at 5,057 and a total of 10,915 others were injured, said the Ministry of Home Affairs on Tuesday. Thousands are still missing.

In the Nepalese capital and surrounding areas, many collapsed houses and their ruins remain not cleaned and many bodies are believed to be trapped underneath.

In the tourist town of Bhaktaur, the residential areas were virtually torn apart by the quake and all the residents are living outdoors or in tents. Some families are staying on trucks or in vehicles.

Nepalese troops and police are patrolling the streets of devastated areas and the security and order situation remain calm and peaceful in general.

Rescue helicopters have been unable to land in remote mountainous areas. Shambhu Khatri, a technician on board one of the helicopters, said entire hillsides had collapsed in parts of the worst-hit Gorkha district, burying settlements, and access was impossible.

"The big challenge is to find a place to land," he said.

Nepalese Prime Minister Sushil Koirala warned the death toll could rise as high as 10,000. While still battling food and water shortages, the Himalayan nation announced three days of mourning from Wednesday.
