MADISON (WKOW) -- Nepali students studying in Madison are devastated to hear of the massive earthquake that killed more than 1,800 people in their home country.



Members of UW-Madison's Nepal Student Association say they tried desperately to get in touch with their loved ones across the world on Saturday.

"The phone lines were down, so it was a lot of struggle to find information about what's going on in Nepal - certainly we see a lot of information on Facebook, social media - lots of texts going back and forth," says Surendra Prajapati.



Prajapati tells 27 News his immediate family was not hurt in the earthquake, but some of his friends have lost their homes.
