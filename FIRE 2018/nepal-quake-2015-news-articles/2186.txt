Qatar has started an air bridge to Nepal, upon the directives of HH the Emir Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad al-Thani, to supply aid to the Nepalese population affected by a massive earthquake that has killed more than 2,000 and injured a lot more.

Two aircraft laden with Qatari aid materials left on Sunday from Doha, Qatar News Agency (QNA) reported. Each plane carried 60 tonnes of relief materials including foodstuffs, medicines, power generators and tents.

Two other aircraft will leave on Monday with 120 tonnes of relief materials, in addition to a field hospital provided by Qatari Red Crescent (QRC) to deliver medical aid to the affected people.

The Standing Committee of Emergency, Rescue, Relief and Humanitarian Aid, headed by Lekhwiya, undertook the task of preparing the relief materials and coordinating with the concerned authorities.

The aid materials are being flown into the Nepalese capital of Kathmandu by the Qatar National Search and Rescue Team to be handed over to the local authorities for distribution to affected areas, QNA added.

QRC had on Saturday issued an emergency appeal to raise QR12mn for the relief of Nepal earthquake victims and allocated QR1mn for emergency relief operations concerning health, sheltering, water, sanitation and restoring family links.

The Government of Nepal has established a Prime Minister Disaster Relief Fund to receive financial assistance for the rescue and recovery of the victims of the devastating earthquake.
