<text>
THE Nepalese Community Limerick will hold a candlelit vigil this Wednesday, April 29 from 5pm at Bedford Row to honour the victims of the devastating earthquake that hit Nepal at the weekend, which has so far claimed more than 4,000 lives.

The group will be collecting donations in aid of the relief effort in Nepal and is encouraging Limerick locals to attend and show their support for the Nepalese community.

Amrit Shrestha, spokesperson for Nepalese Community Limerick, said: “We ask you to please stand with us at this difficult time. There are many Nepalese people in Limerick and Ireland but we still do not know how many have been affected by this tragedy.

“There is also a large Irish population in Nepal who will need our support. Nepalese Community Limerick would like to reach out to anyone who needs our help. We hope that the people of Limerick will join us on Wednesday to honour the victims, to raise awareness and to fundraise for the survivors.”

Donations can also be made by bank transfer to Nepalese Community Limerick, Account Number: 21202728, IBAN: IE78BOFI90431721202728.
