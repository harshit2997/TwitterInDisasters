(Photo: AP)[/caption] The Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS), which is often in the line of fire over alleged religious discrimination, has a different face. The right body has extended a major helping hand in Nepal, which has been devastated by a massive earthquake, killing at least 6200 injuring thousands others. The RSS has appointed its second-in-command, Dattatreya Hosbole, to coordinate relief work in Nepal, and as many as 1000 of its workers are working 24x7 to provide relief and rescue to those hit by the quake. In addition to setting up several shelters, housing those displaced by the earthquake, the RSS members have been working non-stop to ensure necessary food items for the victims. Workers of the group are also rescuing victims from flood-hit areas. However, reports said that the RSS has been facing policy obstacles in the relief work. A regulation by the Nepal government that all the relief materials and funds need to be routed through it is likely to hamper the operation. Meanwhile, over 16,000 RSS workers from Gujarat will raise funds for quake-torn Nepal victims and help in the relief and rehabilitation works. Gujarat RSS media in-charge Pradeep Jain told reporters here today that the massive fund collection drive will be held on May 1 across the state.
