Nepal: Israel rescues surrogate babies, leaves mothers behind

Israel has received criticism from the world for the selective rescue of people caught in the tragedy in Nepal. In the aftermath of the earthquake that has killed over 6,000 people, the country rescued 26 surrogate Israeli babies, while choosing to ignore the mothers, according to a time.com report.

A Boeing-747 brought 15 babies back from Nepal to Israel on 28 April, but the surrogate mothers were not allowed to travel. However, the country is reportedly willing to ease immigration hurdles to fly pregnant surrogate mothers to Israel. The country is also running a field hospital on the ground in Kathmandu.

While India was the favoured destination for Western nations for surrogacy in the past, a new law in 2013 prevented gay men and couples married less than two years from using surrogate mothers in the country. Those who were midway through the process had to move the mothers to Nepal for delivering babies, while several Israeli surrogacy agencies also later moved to Nepal.

Meanwhile within Israel as well, a debate has been kicked off over reviewing the country's surrogacy laws as well as the government expenditure on rescuing surrogate babies.
