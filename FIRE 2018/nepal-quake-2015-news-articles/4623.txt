ISLAMABAD - Foreign Secretary Aizaz Ahmad Chaudhry on Sunday said Pakistan supports Afghan-led and Afghan-owned reconciliation process to ensure peace, security and development in the region.

Talking to newsmen here at Foreign Office, he said stability in neighboring Afghanistan is critical to peace in South Asia as a stable Afghanistan will ensure peace in the region.

"We believe peace in Afghanistan would mean peace for the whole region," he said.

The Foreign Secretary said Pakistan has repeatedly offered to facilitate reconciliation process to ensure peace and security in Afghanistan.

Replying to a question about recent process of dialogue between representatives of Taliban and Afghan government in Qatar, the Foreign Secretary said it is "Track-II" dialogue and expressed the hope that it will prove successful creating way for formal talks.

He said Pakistan fully supports this reconciliation process being held in Qatar.

According to details a 20-member delegation from Afghanistan had reached Qatar to hold two-day talks with Taliban representatives aimed at ending Afghanistan's long war.

Qatar's Foreign Ministry confirmed that it was hosting "reconciliation" talks to help try to deliver security, peace and stability to the Afghan people.

As these are "Track-II" talks, therefore all the participants are of the view that they are attending the talks in an individual capacity and no one participates as representative for any government or party.

Even, Afghan presidential spokesman Ajmal Abidy said members of the country's High Peace Council would attend the talks in Doha in their 'personal capacity only'.

According to reports, Afghan President Ashraf Ghani, elected last year, has pushed for peace talks with the Taliban.

Pakistan on Sunday once again assured Nepal that it will continue its relief operation for the earth-quake victims in Nepal.

"Pakistan under special directives from Prime Minister Muhammad Nawaz Sharif stands shoulder to shoulder with their Nepali brothers and sisters in this need of hour," said Foreign Secretary Aizaz Ahmed Chaudhry.

He said Pakistan was the first country to respond by sending relief and rescue teams to Nepal soon after the devastated earthquake that hit Nepal in last week of April, and actively continued its relief operation till today.
