ByHe himself survived the deadly calamity - he even saw buildings collapse in front of his eyes - but Pune based mountaineer Umesh Zirpe has decided to stay back to help victims of the Himalayan tragedy in Nepal.Zirpe has contacted the volunteers of his organisation Giripremi in Pune and asked them to be prepared to travel to Nepal for rescue operations if necessary. On Saturday, Umesh and 12 other mountaineers from Pune reached Kathmandu airport safely. According to Zirpe, there are still many people from Maharashtra stuck in various parts of Nepal."The situation here is extremely critical," Zirpe told Mirror from Kathmandu. "The roads are full of debris and those who survived the calamity are shattered. At this moment, they are in need of three things: moral support, blood, and money. After seeing the devastation here, I have decided to stay back to help others." Zirpe had led the Pune-based team that conquered Mt Everest in 2012.He had again taken a team of mountaineers to the Everest base camp. He and his team had returned to Kathmandu when the tragedy struck on Saturday. "We had landed in Kathmandu and I was travelling in a car when I suddenly felt that whole car was shaking," Zirpe said. "Initially I thought the cars of the car got punctured but later we realized that it was something bigger. As we realised that it was an earthquake, I and the car driver just left the vehicle and ran through the middle of the road."Zirpe said he saw buildings "collapsing and turning into debris in a flash. It was the ugliest scene. The people here lost their homes and they are shattered."After seeing his team of 12 mountaineers off at Kathmandu airport, Zirpe decided to stay back. "I have a long association with Nepal and I have friends in local organisations who help us during mountaineering expeditions. Now in their crisis, I thought we should help them," he said. "Apart from Nepali nationals, there are several Maharashtrian people including families and mountaineers who are stuck there and I thought of helping them out."Zirpe is helping victims in Kathmandu and nearby areas. On Sunday, he visited a local hospital and got the details of people especially from Maharashtra who are admitted."They are in need of help and now I am helping the local organisations to provide help to the needy people."
