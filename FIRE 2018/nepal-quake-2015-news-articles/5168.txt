Kathmandu people will remember Pak Army’s support: Nepal army chief

RAWALPINDI: The Nepal Army chief, General Gaurav SJB Rana, has said that the people of Kathmandu would remember Pakistan because doctors from the Pakistan Army were present round the clock and they camewith ample stock of medicines.

He expressed these remarks during his visit to the Pakistan Army Field Hospital in Bhaktapur, Nepal, on Sunday, says a press release issued by Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR).He expressed his gratitude for wholehearted support extended by Pakistan and the Pakistan Army during the recent earthquake in Nepal.

The Nepalese army chief met Pakistani relief workers and appreciated their efforts to provide solace to the earthquake victims in Nepal. The Pakistan Army field hospital at Bakhtapur is the main source of receiving medical aid for the earthquake-affected people of Nepal.

The Pakistani Army Urban Search and Rescue teams are also round the clock busy in rescue work.Earlier, last week Ms Valerie Amos, Under-Secretary General for Humanitarian Affairs and Emergency Relief Coordinator, along with Christos Stylianides, European Commissioner for Humanitarian Aid and Crisis Management also visited the Pakistan Army field hospital in Bakhtapur. They praised the state-of-the-art field camp and rescue and relief efforts by the Pakistan Army doctors and Urban Search & Rescue (USAR) team.
