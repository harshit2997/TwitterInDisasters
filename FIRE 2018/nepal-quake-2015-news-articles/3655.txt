The search and rescue operation is well into Day Four now and international aid continues to arrive in Kathmandu. China was among the first contributors to the huge international effort. Letâ€™s take a look at how their operations are coping with the intensity of the search, rescue and treatment of the Nepalese people.

After 34 hours of continuous efforts, a Chinese rescue team successfully pulls out another live victim from a collapsed building in Kathmandu,

The lucky survivor received on-site medical treatment and was rushed to a nearby hospital.

"For now the survivor's vital signs are quite stable, we just checked on him, and gave him some preliminary treatment. His leg had been stuck for too long, so we gave him some treatment to prevent crush injury syndrome, and gave him intravenous fluids and oxygen," Wang Guanjun, medical worker with Chinese International Rescue Team, said.

Apart from dispatching rescue and medical personnel, the Chinese government has also promised to provide 20 million yuan ($3.3 million USD) in humanitarian aid to Nepal.

The aid includes supplies of tents, blankets and generators. The first batch is being delivered today. And it has pledged to offer further support according to Nepal's demands.

Meanwhile, another five tons of supplies -- donated by companies and Chinese expatriates -- were to be flown to Nepal in two shipments from Guangzhou in southern China.

"The first batch, mainly tents, landed in Nepal in the early hours of Tuesday, and the second will contain communications and lighting equipment, food and medicine. We hope the people of Nepal can receive these supplies as soon as possible," Lin Li with Cargo Department of China Southern Airlines, said.

The airport in Kathmandu is overstretched as international aid keeps pouring into the country, but the Chinese government says they are coordinating to ensure all the supplies get delivered.
