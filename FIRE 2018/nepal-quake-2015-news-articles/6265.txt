KATHMANDU/PATNA: There was panic in Kathmandu, which bore the brunt of the massive April 25 earthquake, as people rushed out of their homes onto the streets. People held each other as they ran for safety, crying and making desperate calls to their near ones in Kathmandu. On many roads, people stopped their vehicles midway to run for cover.Fear gripped Nepal's Parliament too. Members fled as the Parliament building shook when Communist Party of Nepal (Unified Marxist Leninist) representative Vishnu Poudel was speaking on the rehabilitation of the survivors of the earlier earthquake."It was very scary. The ground shook violently," Reena Shrestha told TOI. Her house at Teku in Kathmandu had developed cracks at many places on April 25. "This time the cracks have widened," she said. Her father-in-law, Janakman, who had survived the 1934 earthquake that was stronger than the last two ones, too, was out in the lawn."Most of the damage has taken place in Sindhupalchowk and Dolakha districts," said Laxmi Prasad Dhakal, Nepal's home ministry spokesperson. Kodari is located in Sindhupalchowk district, where the maximum deaths took place in last month's earthquake.Reports said houses and shops had collapsed in Charikot and Sunkhani (both in Dolakha district), Chautara (Sindhupalchowk district) and Salleri and Namche (both in Solokhumbhu district), which lies at the foot of Everest. Incidents of house and wall collapse were reported from Sallaghari in Bhaktapur, an ancient city 10km east of Kathmandu, Teku and Sitapaila in the Nepalese capital. The serial tremors triggered landslides at three places in Sindhupalchowk, through which the Araniko Rajmarg connecting Kathmandu with Tibet passes.Reports said the impact of the earthquake was felt in Tibet's Jilong and Zhangmu regions as well as Lhasa. In the April 25 earthquake, around 25 people had died on the Tibetan side of the border, where Chinese doctors had treated many injured Nepalese.After an emergency meeting, Nepal's Prime Minister Sushil Koirala told the media, "We must maintain our calm and face the disaster together." Home minister Bamdev Gautam added, "Twenty districts have been hit this time."
