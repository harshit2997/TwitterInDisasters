Outdoor E-commerce Company, The Clymb, And Nepal’s Ace the Himalaya Seek Trekkers to Volunteer in Gorkha Region
</headline>

<text>
Kathmandu, NEPAL – Trek for nine days, labor for four. That’s the opportunity for a 13-day program beginning late September to rebuild villages in the hard-hit Gorkha region at the epicenter of Nepal’s devastation. Trekking volunteers will provide priceless sweat equity along with much needed dollars the help purchase construction supplies.

Portland, Oregon based The Clymb, an e-commerce business that sells outdoor gear, apparel and adventure travel trips, and their on-site partner in Nepal, Ace the Himalaya, are organizing this relief effort. This program has 8 departures beginning in September 2015, and running through next May 2016. These departures will avoid the monsoon season and give time from now until Fall for the arrival city, Kathmandu, and the airport to begin receiving visitors once again.

This trip is dedicated to rebuilding lives. 100% of proceeds will go to the Sambhav Nepal Foundation, a local NGO dedicated to rebuilding villages decimated by this tragic natural disaster. Much of the money will go to purchasing supplies to rebuild the local infrastructure.

Trekking and volunteering will take place in Annapurna: Poon Hill, Pokhara and Ghorepani.

The Clymb is exclusively promoting this tour that is operated by long-term partner Ace the Himalaya. Ace has been working in these communities for years and its founder and many of its porters/guides are from the regions accessed by trekking volunteers. More than 35 Ace employees lost their homes in the earthquake, reports Prem K. Khatry, Ace founder and director.

Luis Vargas, Vice President of the travel business for The Clymb says, “We’re proud to offer these departures for the adventurous and big hearted who are sure to have a very special and lasting experience. Nepal is an extraordinary destination, made magical by the warmth and smile of its people. Getting tourism dollars back in, and quickly, will be a key piece to a sustained recovery.”
