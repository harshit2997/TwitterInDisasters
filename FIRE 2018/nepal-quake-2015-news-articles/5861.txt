#5: Uber & Puppies

Uber offered up more than rides Thursday in some Canadian cities. In honor of National Adopt-A-Shelter-Pet day, users of the ride service could order puppies on demand. All they had to do was choose the puppies option in the app, and for a $30 donation, a dog was delivered to their office for 15-minutes of playing and cuddling. Those who took advantage of the offer welcomed the adorable distractions.



#4: Identical Triplets

When an Indiana couple says their babies are special, the world agrees. That's because, despite the one in a million chance, they have identical triplets. Ashley and Matthew Alexander are adjusting to life with their three healthy little girls. The couple welcomed Ella Shae, Sophia May and Alexis Kay to their family back in March. Since then, the husband and wife team have gotten their nightly feeding, burping and changing routine to about an hour and a half, but still says it is all but impossible for either of them to get three straight hours of sleep each night.





#3: Ford Recall

It has not been a good week for Ford and owners of the 2014 Ford fusion. Ford Motor Company issued three recalls for the car this week. One involves a latch that can cause a door to open without warning. The second concerns an issue that could cause the fuel pump to seize and the car to stall while being driven. The final recall involves a steering gear motor problem that could result in the loss of power steering.



#2: Nepal

Nepal's government is encouraging people to go ahead with their plans to climb Mount Everest. Officials plan to re-open the routes up the Avalanche-stricken mountain as early as next week. Meanwhile, the rescue and recovery operations haven't stopped and six days after the devastating earthquake many people in Nepal are desperate for aid. Government officials say they still urgently need half-a-million tents to provide shelter to what is a huge number of people displaced amid the devastation.





#1: Freddie Gray

A Baltimore police investigation into the death of Freddie Gray found no evidence he suffered injuries during his arrest which caused his death. The medical examiner determined gray slammed into the back of the police van, breaking his neck where his head injury matched a bolt in the van. Investigators also revealed that the van stopped four times; one more stop than previously reported. No word on why or what happened. The medical examiner's office says Freddie Gray's autopsy report could be delivered to the state's attorney's office as soon as today.
