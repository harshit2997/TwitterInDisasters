Las Vegans are answering the call for help in Nepal. Nonprofits are sending groups of volunteers.

Among those headed to Nepal is Levon Budding. On Monday, he decided to leave the comfort of his Las Vegas home and travel nearly 8,000 miles.

Budding recently spent time in Nepal.

"I [have] a lot of photos from my last time there," he said.

Budding will be traveling with fellow volunteers with the JRM Foundation, a nonprofit that works to prevent girls from being forced into human trafficking.

"The people there (Nepal) are so compassionate. They are so easygoing and so friendly. I feel for them," Budding said.

Budding's grandparents served as missionaries in Nepal for a decade. He fears the situation there will only get worse.

"Considering the water is mostly shut off, where are they going to get water? Most people are homeless and it's monsoon season now. Where are they going to go to the bathroom? Cholera is going to become a serious danger," Budding said.

Budding is bringing masks, rice and water filters. He'll be distributing medicine at three campsites.

"There's a lot that we can do here that can go a really long way over there. A very little amount of money - $150 -it can pay for an entire year of school over there at a really decent school," Budding said.

This was the biggest earthquake to strike the region since the 1930s. That quake killed about 17,000 people.

Budding paid for his own plane ticket and supplies. The JRM Foundation has already raised $17,000 for the relief effort.
