CHENNAI: They survived the devastating earthquake in Nepal and returned to Chennai on Monday but the enormity of the disaster and the human tragedy it caused have forged itself indelibly on a group of twelve people from the state who were on a holiday in Kathmandu when the earth caved in.Ramesh Babu, a printer by from Vellore, his family and friends recalled how the quake unleashed panic and mayhem, left bodies strewn amid rubble everywhere and the smell of death hanging thick in the air. They had no food or water for two days and they had to sleep out in the open, but they were among those lucky to make it through the calamity: The Nepal government on Monday revised the toll from the earthquake to 4,000 and the number of injured to 6,500.Babu said he went to Kathmandu last week via Kolkata with his family and friends. "We were in the hotel when we heard of the earthquake around 11.30am," he said, adding that Durbar Square, a Unesco world heritage site in front of the old royal palace, fell like a pack of cards."Our hotel room was heaving. We could only pray for our safety," Babu said. "None of us had seen anything like it before.""We ran around desperately for help. The children were terrified and we were frantic to return home," he said. "There were bodies everywhere. People were shocked and there was a palpable sense of fear and distress among everyone."An Indian Air Force aircraft evacuated the group, taking them to Delhi, where officials put them up at Tamil Nadu Bhavan. "We finally had a meal once we got to Delhi," Babu's wife Manjula said. Babu said airline officials cancelled their return flight three times because Kathmandu was teeming with tourists wanting to get out. We are thankful to the IAF for safely evacuating us," he said.The three teens in Babu's group, R Priyanka, D Soumya and P Pavithra, said they could not help crying when they saw rescuers pulling bodies from under debris. "Our prayers are with the people of Nepal," Priyanka said.Niaz Ahmed, another survivor from Gudiyatam in Vellore district, was unhappy with officials at the Indian embassy. "The officials could not have been less helpful. They did not provide us with any information," he said. "I had to sleep in an open field for two days. But what I went through is nothing compared to the huge tragedy that is still unfolding in Nepal."
