Chinese representative to the United Nations on Friday called for sustained international support and assistance for disaster relief and recovery in Nepal.

"As a least developed country and a landlocked developing country, Nepal is in urgent need of sustained international support and assistance for disaster relief, rehabilitation, post- disaster reconstruction and long-term development," said Liu Jieyi, China's permanent representative to UN at a session of the General Assembly on Nepal held Friday.

Besides the urgent needs of the affected population, members of the international community must support the priority areas identified by the Nepalese government, such as disaster prevention, preparedness and reconstruction, help Nepal with capacity building in disaster response and ensure effective coordination of international efforts with Nepal's national endeavors, Liu said.

In terms of humanitarian aid, China has provided much-needed assistance for the Nepalese government and its people.

"Immediately after the Earthquake, President Xi Jinping and Premier Li Keqiang sent messages of condolences to their Nepalese counterparts to express the solidarity of the Chinese government and people with the Nepalese government and people, and to pledge our readiness to provide all possible help to Nepal's rescue and relief efforts," Liu said.
