Bishop reports 'very, very frightening scene' after earthquake in Nepal

April 28, 2015

Bishop Paul Simick of Kathmandu said that the April 27 earthquake created “a very, very frightening scene” in the capital city of Nepal.

Bishop Simick—the only Catholic bishop in Nepal—told Aid to the Church in Need that he “saw houses falling like a pack of cards,” and people “running in all directions to save their lives.”

Aftershocks have kept the city’s people in fear, the bishop continued, reporting that he ran out of his own office during one tremor.

Although estimates of the death toll in Nepal have reached 4,000, Bishop Simick said that it is impossible to provide an accurate accounting of the damage, because communications have been cut off to many areas. He asked for prayers for victims of the earthquake and for survivors who are grieving, injured, and homeless.
