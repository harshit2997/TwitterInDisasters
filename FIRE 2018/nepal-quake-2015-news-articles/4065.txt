Norwegians help save woman in Nepal
</headline>

Norwegian, French and Israeli rescue workers were involved Thursday in the dramatic rescue of a woman found under the rubble in Kathmandu, five days after a killer quake devastated the city in Nepal.

The 24-year-old woman, Krishna Kumari Khadka, was still alive and her rescue sparked impromptu applause from crowds following the operation that was launched after two dogs from the Norwegian search and rescue team Norsar alerted crews to her presence under the rubble.

It took the crews most of the afternoon to dig her out. She was immediately sent to a local hospital by ambulance. Another person found near her was declared dead at the scene.

“It’s incredible that we could find her, and save her,” one of the Norwegian rescue workers told state broadcaster NRK. “After all the years of training, and all the work with our dogs, it was worth it.”
