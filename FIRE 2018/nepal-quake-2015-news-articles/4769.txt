The devastating earthquake that rocked the nation on April 25 has apparently brought together the otherwise divided political leaders of the country.

Top thee leaders of major political parties, who remained sharply divided in the constitution drafting process, visited different places together on Wednesday to assess the scale of the damage and the ongoing rescue and relief distribution in the quick-hit areas.

After visiting Rasuwa and Nuwakot districts, Prime Minister and Nepali Congress President Sushil Koirala, CPN-UML KP Sharma Oli and UCPN (Maoist) Chairman Pushpa Kamal Dahal arrived here in Dhading for inspection.

Lawmakers of Dhading district also accompanied the top leaders.

After disembarking from the helicopter together with Oli and Dahal at Dhadingbesi on Wednesday, PM Koirala said “all the political parties of Nepal are ready to work together to cope with any kind of national crisis.”

Chief District Officer Basudev Ghimire informed the top leaders including the Prime Minister about the efforts being employed for rescue and relief operation. He said that Rs 118.7 have been distributed as relief in the district.

PM Koirala admitted the failure on the government’s part to make advance preparation to cope with natural disasters like earthquake. He assured that the government would bring relief package and rehabilitation programme.
