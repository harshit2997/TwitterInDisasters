Latest Nepal quake 'seemed like it went forever'
</headline>

<text>
Aid agencies and volunteers already in Nepal thanks to last month's devastating earthquake now have to deal with the aftermath a second quake, almost as strong.

Overnight the Himalayan nation was struck by a 7.3 tremor, killing dozens and injuring more than 1100.

Kiwi volunteer Nate Durkin says at first, he just thought it was another run-of-the-mill aftershock.

"Fifteen seconds in we realised it was actually going to be something quite big," he said on TV3's Paul Henry programme this morning, via phone.

"It seemed like it went forever – it was a really long earthquake."

Save the Children's Sudarshan Shrestha was in a hospital when it began, interviewing a doctor on how the Nepalese health system has been coping with the thousands of people needing medical attention over the past two weeks.

He too thought it was just going to be a minor shake of the type that comes four or five times a day.

"But then it started to increase in intensity, and that's when we had to run out of the hospital."

World Vision NZ chief executive Chris Clarke has concerns the impact of the quakes will be having on children.

"Things were starting to settle down, they were getting the children used to the idea that maybe they'll be alright… then suddenly, wham."

Mr Durkin is also worried, saying the Nepalese have a tendency to hide their emotions when times are tough.

"On the surface the Nepalese people come across as being the most resilient people in the world, and they're not affected. It's one of those cultures where they won't really show they're really, really suffering," he said.

"I'm really concerned for them, and I'm sure that deep down, everyone is really, really suffering here."
