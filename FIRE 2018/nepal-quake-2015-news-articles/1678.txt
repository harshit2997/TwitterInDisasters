A Melbourne mother of two on her first expedition to Mount Everest had nowhere to hide when avalanche washed away her base camp tent on Saturday, a trekking company says.

Renu Fotedar, 48, is among at least 19 people killed at the Everest base camp, with some 200 Australians believed to be still missing in Nepal after Saturday's 7.8 magnitude earthquake.

Dreamers’ Destination Treks and Expeditions managing director Temba Tsheri said Sherpas on the trek with Ms Fotedar had told him she didn't stand a chance.

"There was no time. It was so fast. They couldn't do anything," Mr Tsheri told the Herald Sun.

"There was a big sound. They didn't get the chance to run away. There was no place to hide.

"I lost one Australian, one Chinese and two Sherpas, and all my friends are in hospital, more than 12. It's horrible."

The expeditions company said Ms Fotedar's body has been recovered and is being taken to the capital Kathmandu.

Ms Fotedar was a counsellor, had been living in Switzerland for three years and had two sons, aged 17 and 15.

She studied holistic and transpersonal counselling at the Phoenix Institute of Australia from 2005-07 and founded the Athena International Academy of Behavioral Sciences and Evolutionary Human Skills.

As the death toll passes 3600, Foreign Minister Julie Bishop says more than 1150 Australians are confirmed safe in Nepal.

Australian embassy officials in Kathmandu are trying to confirm the welfare of all Australians in affected areas including India and Bangladesh.
