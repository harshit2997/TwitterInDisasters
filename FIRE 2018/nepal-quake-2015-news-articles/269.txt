The brother of an Ormskirk man who survived the Nepal earthquake told of his family’s overwhelming relief.

Nicholas Roxburgh, 27, originally from Ormskirk and a Liverpool FC supporter, has been out in Nepal for the last nine months working on his PhD.

He was caught in the midst of the enormous 7.8 magnitude quake that struck between the capital Kathmandu and Pokhara.

The quake struck before noon yesterday and was most severely felt in the capital as well as the densely populated Kathmandu Valley.

A magnitude 6.6 aftershock hit about an hour later and smaller aftershocks continued to ripple through the region for hours.

The death toll is now over 1,100 in Nepal.

Speaking to the ECHO, his brother Alasdair, 29, told of the family’s relief. He said: “Nicholas managed to get through to my dad earlier. I’ve not spoken to him but he’s okay. He’s a bit shaken up, as you’d expect.

“It was a very painful five hours waiting to hear from him. It was a shock when we heard about the earthquake.

“Luckily my brother is quite savvy and made his way to the embassy. We knew he’d try to make contact.”

Nicholas was due to fly home on Monday but his flight has been cancelled.

Alasdair tweeted earlier today: “Had contact from my brother - he’s fine if a little shaken. Currently at British embassy. Thank you @foreignoffice for your help. #Nepal”.
