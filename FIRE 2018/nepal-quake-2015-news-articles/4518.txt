The NCW Chairperson, Lalitha Kumaramangalam appealed to the people to donate female-oriented relief material to the Nepal earthquake victims at her office on Wednesday. “The National Commission for women along with Government of India and various other women organizations like Group of Intellectuals and Academicians have decided to pro-actively help women who have been stuck unfairly/unkindly by the disaster in Nepal. While, the Government of India is doing wonderful work in disaster relief, women have special needs. We have decided to help the government of India and Prime Minister Narendra Modi to meet the special needs of women by providing relief supply such as sanitary towels, baby wipes, baby diapers and things like saffron or antiseptic liquids etc so that women’s needs are also met and addressed,” said Kumaramangalam.

The National Commission for Women took this initiative on the pressure of a newly formed women’s organization called Group of Intellectuals and Academicians. GIA is a women’s organization which consists of socially active professional women like doctors, lawyers, chartered accountants, writers, social workers, entrepreneurs etc. They appealed to Lalitha Kumaramangalam for providing basic needs of females and babies as food, clothing and shelter are not enough.

While various organizations have been sending useful items for the victims, things specific to females have escaped attention. The group has suggested NCW to make arrangements like sarees, undergarments for females, sanitary napkins, baby diapers or nappies, baby wet wipes for cleaning, paper disposal bags for disposing napkins and soiled diapers, small toys, baby milk powder and baby food etc.

“Our group has given a representation to National Commission for Women’s chairperson that women have special needs. We need to address them. Sarees, sanitary napkins, towels, baby food etc. We have asked Lalitha Ji to appeal to the entire nation that we are there with them for strength and support. We Indian women are there to provide help to the Nepalese women,” said Monika Arora, convener of GIA.

The organization is planning to appeal to women entrepreneurs, professionals, FICCI ladies organization, Indian Women Network for contribution to the victims of Nepal particularly female oriented relief material.
