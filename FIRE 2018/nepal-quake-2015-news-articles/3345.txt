The city’s architectural history stretches back hundreds of years when the area was an important trading post between what is now India and China. At the time, the region was home to three city-state kingdoms, which competed to build bigger and more-beautiful buildings.

The mixture of influences and the competition between kingdoms gave birth to a uniquely Nepalese style of architecture that uses a lot of brick, intricately carved and painted wooden windows, doorways, and support beams as well as tiled roofs. The most prominent palaces and temples are flanked by various stone and metal sculptures and often have multitiered roofs, a look that is echoed in pagodas across Asia.

Unesco said in a statement on its website that the monuments in the Katmandu Valley and several other national heritage sites in the area “have been heavily affected” by the quake.

“The monumental zones represent the highly-developed architectural expression of religious, political and cultural life of Kathmandu Valley, with a concentration of monuments unique and unparalleled in the world,” says Unesco’s description of the region on its website. “It boasts a unique symbiosis of Hinduism, Buddhism and Tantrism in its culture, which is still as alive today as it was hundreds of years ago.”
