On behalf of the Government and people of the Republic of South Africa, His Excellency President Jacob Zuma has conveyed a message of condolences to the Government and people of the Federal Democratic Republic of Nepal, following a massive earthquake on Saturday, 25 April 2015, that claimed over 1 000 lives.

"Our thoughts are with the people of Nepal and neighbouring countries in the aftermath of the earthquake that has struck the Kathmandu Valley. On behalf of the Government and people of South Africa, I send my deepest condolences to the Government of Nepal and to everyone affected, particularly to the families and friends of those killed and injured," said President Zuma.

The South African High Commission in Colombo, Sri Lanka, is in contact with authorities in Nepal and is on standby to assist South African nationals.
