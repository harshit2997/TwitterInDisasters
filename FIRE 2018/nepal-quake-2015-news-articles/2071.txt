BEND, Ore. -- A young man from Bend who was among the thousands of people missing after a massive earthquake hit Nepal on Saturday is alive and well, his aunt says via Twitter.

Joshua contacted us at 6:15am today alive and well from Beni Nepal!! He needed to dodge a few landslides but okay. Full hearts this morning! â€” Susan Edwards (@nearthebeach) April 27, 2015

Joshua Edwards, 19, is an elite rock climber and was making his way through the area alone, on his dream vacation. His family told KGW he was traveling the world hiking and climbing.

Edwards even graduated from high school early so he could hike the Pacific Coast Trail and go on from there.

The last time Edwards' family heard from him was on Monday. They said he was in the village of Mukitnath and headed to the Annapurna Conservation area to climb. He had been in Lamjung just three days earlier, which was the epicenter of Saturday's Nepal earthquake.

Edwards' father lives in Bend. The family is using social media to try and circulate his photo, hoping someone will recognize him and share any information they may have about his possible whereabouts.
