CALGARY, ALBERTA--(Marketwired - Apr 28, 2015) - Shaw Communications Inc. (TSX:SJR.B) (NYSE:SJR) today announced it will match employee donations dollar-for-dollar to the Canadian Red Cross up to a maximum of $100,000.

To help customers stay connected to their family and friends, all Shaw Phone customers will be given complimentary long distance calling to Nepal until Monday, May 25. Shaw customers will also be given access to Indian-based English-language news channel ATN NDTV 24/7 at no cost to access local coverage through to Wednesday, May 6, 2015.

Shaw will also match all employee donations to the Canadian Red Cross dollar-for-dollar up to $100,000 to help provide critical supplies and aid in rescue and recovery efforts. Aligning with the Federal Government's donation matching program, every dollar donated by Shaw employees could be matched twice, resulting in three dollars of aid to Nepal.

"Our hearts go out to all those affected by the extraordinary impact of Saturday's devastating earthquake in Nepal," says Brad Shaw, CEO, Shaw Communications. "As relief efforts continue we are committed to supporting the effort and doing everything we can to keep our customers connected."
