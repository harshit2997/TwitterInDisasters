A C-130 aircraft of the Bangladesh Air Force on Sunday reached Nepal with 10 tonnes of relief materials.



The relief materials were sent at the directive of Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina to help the affected people of devastating earthquake that hit Nepal on Saturday, leaving nearly 2,000 people dead.

PM’s Press Secretary AKM Shameem Chowdhuri said the cargo aircraft of the Air Force with 34-member team, including representatives of the Foreign Ministry, 6 army medical teams and Air Force crews reached the Nepalese capital with 10 tonnes of relief materials, including tents, different types of medicine, dry food, water and blankets on behalf of Bangladesh.

After the handover of the relief items, an expert medical team would stay there in Nepal to provide medical treatment to the quake-affected people and return home on completion of their works.

Previously, Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina’s Special Assistant Mahbubul Hoque Shakil said quoting the head of the government “Bangladesh will help the neighbour to tackle the catastrophe”.

Bangladesh would also provide medical and humanitarian aid, he said.
