The group were expecting to leave base camp and begin their long-awaited hike on Saturday morning but had not been heard from since.

Before her husband Scott was found, Nicole Stuart said she had been trying to stay positive.

“I’m trying to stay positive but there are all these images coming through — it’s that constant ‘what if’ type of thing,” she said.

“My gut feeling is that he’s okay.”

The families heard the group were well just after 4pm today.

Queensland friends Ben Flanders and Jai Williams also n managed to contact their families this afternoon after they were caught up in the earthquake while trying to climb to Mt Everest base camp.

Initially 12 Queenslanders were reported missing but this number is believed to have increased by at least two. The families of eleven of these have confirmed to The Courier-Mail that they have heard from their relatives to let them know they were safe.

Jackson Casagrande, 22, text his family about 6.10pm Saturday night saying he was safe but mother Iris Casagrande said she was still frantic.

“He said there were no buildings or powerlines but with all the aftershocks, you just don’t know what the situation is.”

Others have been accounted for, including intrepid hiker Alyssa Azar, who at 18 years old was on her second attempt to hike the world’s highest peak.

Almost 550 Australians have been confirmed as travelling in Nepal at the time of the earthquake with Foreign Minister Julie Bishop saying more than 200 were already accounted for.

“While there are reports of extensive loss of life, at this point there are no reports of Australians deaths,” Ms Bishop said.

She urged Australians to try to contact their family and friends directly.
