Planned holiday in Nepal turns to fundraising mission for St. Agatha man

The Peak Freaks-First Steps mission would build a school with earth-filled used rice bags, which are laid out like bricks, covered with chicken wire and then plastered over. The simple technique provides more give than traditional mud brick walls, making them able to resist earthquakes of up to 7.8 magnitude.

Huber, who works as chief financial officer for tech startups Sweet Tooth and P and P Optica, says he plans to use his contacts in the community to reach a fundraising goal of $25,000. The money raised will go to Mennonite Central Committee's Nepal relief efforts.

"It may be lofty, but I think this community should be good for it," he said.

"For me, part of this is to rally behind the belief that friends, family and community can make a difference."

Huber admits he was alarmed at the speed with which public and media attention have moved on to other topics because the people of Nepal are still in dire need.

"I think that made my resolve even greater to not let this disappear," he said.

Several elements of his own life seem to converge in his desire to help in Nepal, Huber said. His parents came to Canada as immigrants — his father from Romania, his mother from Poland — with nothing and made a good life here. As someone living in a country filled with opportunity, "I want to give something back."

For several years, his family sponsored a Nepalese child, Elina Tamang, through Plan Canada. As he looks at the photos of the grave-faced young girl, standing in a field with her mother — she's probably 14 or 15 now — he feels a strong urge to do what he can to help.

"It's unimaginable, what happened," he said. "I feel a sense of duty to say life is not things, life is about experiences. I want to make a difference if I can, even in a small way."
