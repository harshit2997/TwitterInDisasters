DEHRADUN: Contributing their bit to help victims of the devastating earthquake that hit Nepal last week, as many as about 2,000 policemen donated blood during a blood donation camp organized in Uttarakhand on Wednesday.More than 1,200 cops queued up at the Dehradun district police lines, while 800 police personnel donated blood at Udham Singh Nagar police lines.The camp was organized by four hospitals, including two government and several private ones, at Dehradun.A makeshift arrangement for 70 beds was made in the conference hall at the police lines. The volunteers, mostly belonging to the state capital and Haridwar, underwent a mandatory medical test and later donated blood.Long queues of cops could be seen outside the conference hall, while scores waited for their turn inside the premises.IG. intelligence, G N Goswani, DIG Pushpak Jyoti and SP, city, Ajay Singh were also in attendance.Cops posted in civil police, PAC, intelligence, training centres and other units also volunteered for the cause. The camp will be held for the next few days.Earlier, DGP B S Sidhu had appealed to policemen across the district to donate blood for victims undergoing treatment at hospitals in Nepal.More than 4,500 cops have volunteered for the cause till now. With the police force comprising 25,500 cops, sources say the figure is likely to climb in the next few days."We've received an overwhelming response from policemen. Many of them are posted in the deep interior parts of the state and it is difficult to contact them," Sidhu told TOI.Meanwhile, police personnel from Garhwal region also donated blood at Dehradun. A similar drive was also organised in Udham Singh Nagar for cops posted in the Kumaon region.
