Israel aids Nepal without hesitation

Among more than two-dozen international medical teams as well as search and rescue missions deploying to Nepal, Israel’s contingency of humanitarian workers is among the largest helping the Himalayan nation deal with the aftermath of a devastating earthquake April 25.

The response comes as no surprise. Despite its own troubles, Israel has consistently sprung to action to assist nations large, small, near and far with its vast expertise in humanitarian aid.

The Israeli mission includes an Israel Defense Forces (IDF) field hospital, a trained rescue team, and a security team.

“You are being sent on an important mission,” Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said, addressing the Israeli team members. “This is the true face of Israel—a country that offers aid over any distance at such moments.”

Israel’s field hospital, in fact, was expected to be the first in operation in Nepal, IDF spokesman Lt. Col. Peter Lerner said. A separate, private mission organized by three Israeli emergency response organizations — United Hatzalah, Zaka and First Israel – recently left Tel Aviv for Nepal and aims to stay two to three weeks. Along with search-and-rescue operations, the mission will provide basic medical care to far-flung villages near the quake’s epicenter whose health clinics are either destroyed or saturated with wounded. IsraAid and Magen David Adom are also deploying delegations.

The powerful earthquake and its aftershocks shook the entire Himalayan region, killing at least 2,500 people. According to recent reports, more than 5,000 people are injured. Some 200 Israelis are among those reported missing as of press time.

Nepal has long been a popular destination for young Israelis, many of whom travel there for extended periods following their years of mandatory military service. .
