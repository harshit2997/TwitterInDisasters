Potent New Nepal Earthquake Compounds Relief and Rebuilding Challenge

Demonstrating the widespread tectonic hazard in the Himalayas, a potent new earthquake, still technically an aftershock, has struck halfway between Kathmandu and Mount Everest. Ellen Barry has a solid roundup in The Times.

Population density over the epicenter of today’s quake is similar to that where the 7.8-magnitude struck to the west on April 25. (See the helpful GeoHazards International map showing population densities.) This new temblor will surely stretch relief efforts, with so much need for housing, clean water and medical care already to the west. The Times has a useful list of reliable relief groups seeking donations.

[11 a.m. | As I sketched on Twitter earlier, in the Himalayas and other regions with big, poor populations and profound seismic hazards, you end up with a cascade of shocks and aftershocks, creating a dangerous superimposition of rescue, relief, assessment, rebuilding and research.

2:50 p.m. | Defense Department officials reported that a Huey helicopter carrying two Nepalese soldiers and six Marines in an area hard hit by the first earthquake is missing.]

The U.S. Geological Survey, as always, has an incredibly thorough summary of the seismic situation and Twitter, as always, is the best source of moment-by-moment updates. Here’s a CNN map comparing the two locations:

Here’s an apparent landslide under way in the region near Everest, photographed from a relief helicopter by a physician connected with the nonprofit group Doctors For Nepal:

Various Twitter updates will be added below. Particularly helpful is the stream (also on Facebook) from Nepal’s National Society for Earthquake Technology, which deals risk reduction through resilient building, advancing seismology capacity and tracking relief efforts:

Kit Miyamoto, a structural engineer who’s been in the region since the first earthquake, has posted an incredibly important video showing how a poorly constructed school in one village pancaked while a well-built school within sight stood firm:

As we enter the assessment phase, we can learn from what has happened and move forward. https://t.co/u771YAQyR3 — Miyamoto Int’l (@miyamotointl) 11 May 15

Luckily, schools across the country were closed for 30 days after the first earthquake, meaning that any classroom collapses today were unlikely to claim many victims.

Here’s a Tweet of mine, focused on reducible seismic threat to schools worldwide:
