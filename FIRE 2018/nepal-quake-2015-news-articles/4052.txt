At work in Nepal

Read on for article

The Joint Israelife Disaster Response team, comprising volunteers from ZAKA, United Hatzolah and F.I.R.S.T, attended to about thirty injured Nepalese yesterday in the small, far-flung villages east of Kathmandu.

During their travels, they collected information about the scope of the damage and the loss of life.

In addition, volunteers worked both in Israel and Nepal to locate and retrieve Israeli travelers who were stranded within a short distance from Kathmandu. As of now, there are no more Israeli travelers awaiting rescue near Kathmandu.

Attempts to locate the family members of Nepalese in Israel who await for signs of life from their dear ones in the earthquake-damaged region have yet to succeed.

As of tomorrow (Thursday), the Joint Israelife Disaster Response team will head out to more outlying villages for a few days. Local Nepalese people are offering their assistance to the team.

Delegation head Gabi Barshishat: “We came here to help the locals. For now, the needs are mainly humanitarian – food, water, electricity, a roof over their heads. We are offering medical and logistical assistance wherever we can. Our objective now is to establish a field hospital in the outlying villages where ongoing treatment is required.”

The Joint Israelife Disaster Response team is working in close cooperation with the Israeli Foreign Ministry, the IDF Home Front Command and the many international rescue teams in Nepal.
