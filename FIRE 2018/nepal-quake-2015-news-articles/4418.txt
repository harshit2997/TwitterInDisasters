Palos Hills Man Rescued, was Stranded in Mountains During Nepal Earthquake
</headline>

A Palos Hills man who was stranded in the Himalayas during a deadly Nepal earthquake is safe Thursday.

Corey Ascolani was hiking in the mountains when Saturday’s 7.8-magnitude earthquake hit. He and a fellow hiker had stopped for coffee, when ”the ground started moving ... rolling, up and down, side-to-side.” The two, along with 26 other people, then found themselves trapped on the mountain for several days, ABC7 reports.

Ascolani reached out to his family in a video, detailing the moments he witnessed rocks falling around them, and people around him overturning tables to use as shelter. One of those with him had a satellite phone, which helped rescuers track their location.

“Americans rescued us, and it was quite lucky because they took the whole group, which we were concerned about,” Ascolani told ABC7.



Ascolani is in Kathmandu Thursday, ”to try to relax and try to calm down.”
