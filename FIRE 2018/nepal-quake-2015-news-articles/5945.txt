Additional humanitarian assistance to Nepal Media release

The Australian Government will provide an additional $5 million to support the people of Nepal in the wake of the devastating earthquake. Our thoughts continue to be with those people affected by this terrible tragedy.

This additional package of assistance will include:

$2.5 million towards the United Nations Flash Appeal;

$1.5 million to assist Australian non-government organisations (NGOs);

$0.5 million to support RedR Australia to deploy Australian humanitarian experts to support United Nations operations; and

$0.5 million to support the Australian Red Cross.

Australia remains one of the largest donors to the relief effort in Nepal, with total assistance provided so far at over $10 million.

The United Nations Flash Appeal aims to address the most urgent humanitarian needs of 8 million Nepalese. Australia's support will help to provide much needed assistance in the areas of food security, health, shelter, water and sanitation.

Australian Non-Government Organisation (NGO) partners are already in-country providing access to safe water and sanitation for 30,000 people, emergency shelter needs for over 40,000 people and protection programs to target the needs of 20,000 women and children across Nepal.

On 30 April, two C17s arrived in Kathmandu carrying more than 15 tonnes of humanitarian relief supplies to assist up to 5000 people, plus additional humanitarian and consular personnel. This included around 80,000 water purification tablets, 750 hygiene kits, 940 tarpaulins and 1200 blankets.

The Australian Government will continue to work closely with the Government of Nepal and other partners to determine what recovery and reconstruction assistance will be required.
