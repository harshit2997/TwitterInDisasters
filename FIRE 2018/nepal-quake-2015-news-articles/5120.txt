When local East Goshen residents Jeff and Pam Bryer heard of the earthquake in Nepal, they were horrified. “We were kind of frantic.” Jeff Bryer said.

The couple had traveled to Nepal in 2013 and trekked around the rural areas near the capitol, Kathmandu.

One of their friends, a Nepalese native, Kanchha, lived in the area where the earthquake struck.

He survived the earthquake unharmed, but according to Jeff Bryer, “his house collapsed.” Wanting to help, Jeff and Pam Bryer have, along with some friends collected roughly $2,000 in a few days.

Kanchha is one of the lucky ones. So far the quake has killed over 6,000 people. And the death toll is expected to climb much higher.

They want him to use the funds so that “he might be able to start the process of rebuilding his home.” Jeff Bryer said.

Kanchhu is a member of the Sherpa people, an ethnic group within Nepal widely regarded as some of the best mountaineers in the world. They often serve as guides. “They [Sherpa] work really hard and they’re wonderful people, but they don’t have a whole lot.” Jeff Bryer added.

The rural region surrounding Kathmandu has made it difficult for aid and media coverage to extend beyond the capitol. The trails “aren’t big enough for any kind of automobile.” Pam Bryer said. “The only way to get from village to village is, in fact, on foot.”

Which means Kanchha must walk roughly 140 kilometers to see his family. “I doubt there are any realistic options other than walking.” Jeff Bryer said.

During their visit to the region, Jeff and Pam saw many UNESCO world heritage sites, many of which were destroyed in the earthquake. “We could recognize the temples that we had been to … that are no longer there,” Jeff Bryer said.

One temple that still stands, cremates deceased Hindu practitioners. However with the death of so many Hindus, families have “made funeral pyres and started their own cremations,” Jeff Bryer added.

Jeff Bryer said he isn’t looking for his personal cause, but he does encourage anyone interested in helping the Sherpa people to visit www.thesiredmundhillaryfoundation.ca, and anyone interested in helping the region in general to look to big-name charities such as the Red Cross.
