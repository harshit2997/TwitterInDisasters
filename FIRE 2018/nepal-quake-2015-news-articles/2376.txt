A retired employee of the Palvancha-based Kothagudem Thermal Power Station (KTPS), his wife and father are believed to have been stranded in the earthquake-ravaged Kathmandu, where they had gone to visit the famous Pashupatinath temple on Saturday.

P. Satyanarayana, a retired foreman of the KTPS, his wife Uma Devi, father Komuraiah, a retired employee of a nationalised bank, have gone to Nepal along with some other pilgrims from Warangal five days ago.

They reached Kathmandu in the early hours of Saturday after visiting various places as part of their pilgrimage.

As the news of the devastating earthquake in Nepal broke out on Saturday afternoon, Satyanarayana’s son Sandeep, a casual worker of the KTPS in Palvancha, called his father over phone to enquire about the latter’s safety.

Satyanarayana reportedly told Sandeep that they were trying to check out of a lodge which was situated in the earthquake-ravaged zone in Kathmandu. However, Satyanarayana’s mobile phone got disconnected abruptly, leaving his son in a state of anxiety.

I called them repeated to confirm the safety of my father, mother and grandfather, but in vain, deplored Sandeep.

Speaking to The Hindu , Sandeep said, “I could not contact my father as his mobile phone is switched off. I am terribly worried over the fate of my parents and grandfather.”
