Aid supplies leave Brisbane for Nepal

Two planes carrying essential aid and personnel are set to leave Brisbane for earthquake-ravaged Nepal.

The two C-17A Globemasters are loaded with six tonnes each of tarpaulins and health supplies, over two tonnes of blankets and 80,000 water purification tablets.

The planes will depart from the RAAF base at Amberley at 8am and 10am on Wednesday enroute to Kathmandu.

Once the aid is delivered the next job for defence force and Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade (DFAT) personnel is to evacuate Australians in Nepal to Bangkok.

A DFAT spokesman said around 1000 Australians had so far sought evacuation assistance.

The death toll from Saturday's devastating quake has now tipped 5000 people with around 8000 injured.
