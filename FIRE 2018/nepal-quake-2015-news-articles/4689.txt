Last month’s earthquake in Nepal has left more than 7,500 people dead – and counting. Photojournalist Showkat Shafi was there last week to cover the devastation.

On Thursday 7 May at 10am, The Daily Vox managing editor Faranaaz Parker will host a Google hangout with Shafi on covering natural disasters, what it’s like on the ground in Nepal, and what international aid is still needed.
