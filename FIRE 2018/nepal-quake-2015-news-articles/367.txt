With around 550 tourists from Gujarat stranded in Nepal, the state government has asked two of its officials, who were co-ordinating the rescue operations for tourists who met with the April 22 bus accident, to stay back in Kathmandu. By 4.30 pm, a special control room set up by the state government had received over 40 calls from families whose members had gone to Nepal.

“There were many callers who mentioned that their kin were in groups of 10-15 people,’’ said Bipin Bhatt, Director, Rescue and Relief Operations.

Panic struck people in Ahmedabad, Vadodara and Surat that felt the impact of the quake, bringing back memories of the January 26, 2001 Bhuj earthquake.

“A tour group of around 80 people is stuck there, including my brother Nitinbhai Thakker, his wife Anjanaben and my sister Arunaben. The group was touring Pokhara as part of a group of 30 people when the quake hit. I spoke to my brother in the afternoon and they are all safe,” said Rohit Thakker, owner of Ahmedabad-based Navbharat Travels.

“During summer vacations, around 10,000 tourists from the state travel to Nepal and Kailash Mansarovar annually. I have put my tour packages on hold,” said Manish Sharma, another tour operator who conducts tours to Kailash Mansarovar and Kathmandu.

Chief Minister Anandiben Patel tweeted, “Tremors have been felt in parts of Gujarat as well. While the situation is being closely monitored, I appeal people to stay calm & not to panic”. Patel was in New Delhi for a meeting of the NITI Aayog.

B K Rastogi, director of the Institute of Seismological Research, has ruled out any damage in Gujarat. “The magnitude of earthquake Nepal has witnessed can cause damage to 300 km area around the epicenter. Beyond 300 km, there can be impacts of earthquake but not damage. Gujarat is far away from Nepal, and people here don’t need to worry about either today’s shock or aftershocks,” he said.
