A rescue team from Turkey has retrieved the body of a man trapped in a collapsed house by the Saturday's earthquake.

Earlier, the French rescue team had made an attempt to pull out the body from the debris, but was not successful. The Turkish team was then called for the same, the District Natural Disaster Rescue Committee, Dolakha said.

The district-based Barda Bahadur Battalion of Nepal Army assisted the rescue team. Twenty people who had been battling for life in the district, following the earthquake devastation were rescued alive by the NA, said a civil society leader Chiranjibi Maskey.

Another above 1,000 people still remain out of contact since the devastating earthquake in the district, he added. RSS
