Spains Margallo Expresses Condolences to India, Nepal and China



NEW DELHI  Spainish Minister of Foreign Affairs and Co-operation, Jose Manuel Garcia-Margallo, on Monday expressed condolences to Nepal, India and China for deaths caused by the devastating earthquake that struck the Himalayan region on Saturday.



Garcia-Margallo, on an official visit to India with a business delegation, inaugurated Monday the Spain-India Business Summit, organized by Indias Industry Confederation.



Opening his speech, the diplomatic chief, in the name of the Spanish King, the government and people, expressed condolences to Nepal, India and China for the lives lost in the 7.8-magnitude earthquake.



The death toll in Nepal, the epicenter of the quake, has surpassed 3,200, while overnight rain and poor communications have made rescue operations difficult.



In India, the death count now stands at 62 and the number of injured at 269.



In China, reports said 20 people died while 58 others were injured.



The Spanish foreign minister arrived in India on Sunday on a visit to strengthen political and economic relations between the two countries.



Though Garcia-Margallo will continue with the agenda of his visit to New Delhi, which includes meetings with Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi and other ministers, he is staying abreast of new information about the quake and the fate of Spanish citizens still missing in Nepal.



Spains foreign ministry continues to search for 117 citizens unaccounted for, mostly tourists, and residents and occasional visitors, according to diplomatic sources.



As many as 449 Spanish nationals were in Nepal when the devastating earthquake struck, of whom 332 have been located.



A Spanish Air Force Airbus 310 will make two flights between Kathmandu and New Delhi on Monday to evacuate citizens already standing by at Kathmandu airport.



The aircraft is expected to make a third flight on Tuesday before returning to Spain.
