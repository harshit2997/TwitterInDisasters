Calgary’s Container Bar to hold fundraiser for Nepal after owner makes it safely out of earthquake zone

Staff at Brasserie Kensington were relieved to hear their well known boss had made it safely out of Nepal after being stranded in the mountains by the recent earthquake, and now they hope to translate his experience – and cachet – into support for those most directly affect by the disaster.

As Metro reported in late April, bar owner Cam Dobranski and his new wife Jacq ended up trapped in a mountainous region while on a hiking honeymoon when the earthquake struck just days after they got married in Nepal.

Their situation “weighed heavily” at first on the staff at the bar, said office manager Toni Younker, who were happy to hear the couple later made it to safety in India and eventually back to Canada.

“We’re a really, really tight-knit company here,” she said. “Everyone’s like family.”

The personal connection also brought the tragedy into sharp focus for employees, Younker added, and now they are planning to play off “the cult following that Cam and Jacq have” locally to help raise funds for the reconstruction effort in Nepal.

A fundraising event is set for May 14 starting at noon at Container Bar, the alleyway patio next to Brasserie, which Younker said will go on “rain or shine.”

She said proceeds from a silent auction, some drink sales, and a raffle for a $6,000 travel voucher will be donated to Uphill Both Ways, a relief and development organization dedicated to building schools and health-care centres in remote areas of Nepal.

Staff members at the bar often fundraise for various charities, Younker said, and with Cam and Jacq’s experience in Nepal gaining a fair amount of local attention, it offered a natural opportunity to support the long road ahead to reconstruction in Nepal.

“It’s nice to be able to sort of take advantage – not in a bad way – but take advantage of their reputations to be able to contribute even more,” she said.

“While it’s still fresh in everyone’s minds, let’s get some help over there for the long-term, not just the short-term.”
