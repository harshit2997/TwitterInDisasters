Nepal earthquake: Premier offers support to families of Tasmanians missing after disaster

Updated

The families of Tasmanians missing after the earthquake in Nepal have been offered support by Tasmanian Premier Will Hodgman.

In Parliament, Mr Hodgman offered condolences to all those affected and support to families whose loved ones are not yet accounted for.

There is no official count of how many Australians are missing, but the Red Cross estimates it is more than 200.

The Tasmanians unaccounted for are Julien Vincent Tempone, 24, of Launceston and Jenny Davson-Galle, 29.

Mr Hodgman also sent condolences to the close-knit Nepalese community in Tasmania who he said was much valued.

About 500 Nepalese students attend the University of Tasmania.

"The unfolding horror of what has occurred in their homeland as in seen on our television screens and in our newspapers is made even more difficult for them as many have been unable to make contact with loved ones," he said.

Mr Hodgman said the Department of Health and Human Services was investigating the possibility of sending medical personnel and supplies if requested.

Help with search and rescue and disaster victim identification was also being investigated.

"We are in close hourly contact with the relevant agencies in the Commonwealth as part of the national response to this humanitarian disaster," he said.
