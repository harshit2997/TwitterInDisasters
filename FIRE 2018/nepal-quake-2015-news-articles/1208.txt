Christian World Service has launched an appeal to provide relief supplies in Nepal.

The magnitude 7.8 earthquake has caused widespread damage throughout most of the country. The death toll is approaching 2,000 people and continues to rise.

Many people are remaining outside as large aftershocks continue. Rural areas were particularly badly hit and it will take some time for a full picture to emerge.

CWS is working with ACT Alliance (Action by Churches Together) of which it is a part. Members are based in Kathmandu and other parts of the country. They are mobilising life-saving relief: shelter, food, water, blankets and medications.

They are working with the Nepalese government, the UN system and church partners to coordinate their response.

"We are confident in our partners who have been working in Nepal for many years. They are mounting a large scale operation to make sure those that need it most get the help they need," says Pauline McKay National Director.

"We ask church people to remember the people of Nepal and those working to help in their prayers, and if they can please donate to this urgent appeal," she adds.

Donations to the Nepal Earthquake Appeal for emergency relief can be made: on line at www.cws.org.nz/donate, sent to PO Box 22652, Christchurch 8140 or by calling 0800 74 73 72.
