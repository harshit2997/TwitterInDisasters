ISLAMABAD: The Prime Minister House spokesman said in a statement on Saturday evening that on Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif’s orders, four aircraft with relief supplies for quake-affected Nepal are ready at Islamabad airport.

The spokesman went on to say that as soon as clearance is given from Kathmandu airport, the planes will take off from Islamabad.

He added that the PM is in consistent contact with officials regarding the situation.

In a separate statement from London, Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif expressed shock and grief at reports of the massive earthquake, which caused devastation in Nepal and northern India today.

The death toll from the massive earthquake which devastated parts of Nepal on Saturday has risen to 876, according to police.

“The toll from the earthquake has jumped to 876, including 524 from the Kathmandu valley,” police spokesman Kamal Singh Bam said.

In his message, PM Nawaz extended heartfelt condolences and sympathies to the governments and the people of Nepal and India on the tragedy that has caused loss of life and property in both the countries.

He said the government and people of Pakistan express solidarity with the affected people and offer all possible help that may be required in their hour of grief.

The PM also telephoned his Nepalese counterpart Sushil Koirala.

He expressed deep sorrow and condoled over loss of life and property.
