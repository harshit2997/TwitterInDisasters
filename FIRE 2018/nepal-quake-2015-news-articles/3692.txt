PETALING JAYA: The humanitarian crisis in Nepal following the recent earthquake is still evolving, Unicef Malaysia chief of fund-raising and partnerships Richard Beighton said.

“A lot of people have been injured, millions have been affected by the earthquake in one way or another and many of them are children,” Beighton told The Star.

He said that due to the scale of the disaster, Unicef was still assessing the situation to see what kind of supplies and personnel were needed in the country.

“We already have supplies in our warehouse in Kathmandu and those are being used now – items such as water purification tablets, hygiene kits and nutritional supplies,” he said.

He explained that as the UN organisation that has children as its main focus, Unicef’s priority was the wellbeing of the estimated 2.8 million children affected by the earthquake and its aftermath.

“Our main priority is obviously to save lives, so we have to get essential medicines, nutrition, safe water, and hygiene kits to the children, families and communities affected.

He said Unicef Malaysia welcomed cash donations as it would help buy essential supplies for those affected.

“With cash donations, not only can we send in life-saving supplies but we can purchase supplies locally.

“Very often, this method saves us money because shipping from one country to another costs more than buying (in the country),” he said.

He added that the act of buying supplies in Nepal could help restart the country’s economy.

He also praised the generosity of Malaysians in the face of many global tragedies.

“We urgently need support, as we need to get children off the streets into shelters, we need to keep them safe and healthy – and this requires a lot of money,” he said.
