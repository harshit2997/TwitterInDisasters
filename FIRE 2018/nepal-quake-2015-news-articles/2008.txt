'It has been hell': Toronto woman looking for family in Nepal
</headline>

It’s been a troubling two days for Rashmi Thapa.

Before a 7.8 magnitude earthquake hit her native country of Nepal on Saturday, she was in regular contact with her parents and other family members who live there. Since the quake, she hasn’t been able to connect with any of them.

“It has been hell,” Thapa said, unable to fight off tears as she talked about trying to contact family members. “I’m just praying that they are safe.”

While some in Toronto’s Nepalese community have been able to confirm the whereabouts of their relatives, Thapa and her husband are left watching the news and monitoring social media accounts for any updates.

She’s been posting wire pictures of rubble-filled landscapes on her Facebook account as a way to mourn the more than 4,000 people killed in the quake. Most of her family members live in the Gorkha district, just outside the capital, and one of the towns closest to the epicenter of the earthquake.

She’s fearing the worst and is worried that people in her village may not be receiving the attention and help they need.

“I really just want to know what is happening in my village,” said Thapa, who moved here six years ago with her husband and two children. “My children are telling me to stop crying because I can’t change anything, but I can’t.”

A lot of events are planned in the local Nepalese community to mourn and comfort one another. The community is also gathering financial support to help survivors, said Gopal Bhandari, president of Nepalese Canadian Community Services.
