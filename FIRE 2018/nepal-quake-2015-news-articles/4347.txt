Disease next risk for Nepal
</headline>

More bodies are being brought out daily from beneath the piles of rubble where once homes stood in Kathmandu.

So far the number of dead in Nepal has risen to about 5,000, but it could reach above 10,000 with information on casualties from far flung villages yet to come in.

Government officials are describing last Saturday’s destructive earthquake as a disaster on an “unprecedented scale”.

Experts from a polish NGO that has an 87-strong team in Nepal have said the chances of finding people alive in the ruins six days after the quake are next to zero.

It means the focus is turning more to the survivors and doctors are now warning that an out break of epidemics is likely due to the collapse of Kathmandu’s sanitation system – it could cause even more casualties.
