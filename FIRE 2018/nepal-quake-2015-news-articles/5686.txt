The city's Good Samaritans are doing their bit for the rehabilitation of victims in quake-hit Nepal but for many, it's an emot-ional affair. Munni Lama, a 50-year-old working at a beauty salon in Patna, lost relatives on her mother's side, in the Himalayan quake on Saturday. Trying to overcome from the loss, she is now planning to raise funds for those who survived the tragedy. She is one of the many residents of Nepalese originin the city who have come forward to help the quake victims. They are working under the state chapter of Akhil Bharatiya Nepali Adhikar Manch. They are donating money and also mobilising funds for relief and rehabilitation in the quake-torn Himalayan country. Munni, a resident of Boring Road, said: "I lost several relatives on my mother's side in the quake and I am still clueless about the status of some of my acquaintances. I want to provide as much help as I can to those who survived the quake. While I am donating Rs 2,000 to my association, I am also planning to go to the market on Friday, along with other association members, to raise funds, we would ask the people to help the people of Nepal in this hour of crisis. We are in great shock and hope people would join our cause." The 50-year-old is in contact with her other relatives, including her brother, stuck in Nepal in difficult conditions. "They don't even have water to drink and it's continuously raining there. My brother, his wife and children are living under a small tent. I told them to collect the accumulated rainwater, filter it with a thin cloth and drink it. Hope this advice would help them a little bit," she said. Savita Singh Nepali, the chairperson of Akhil Bharatiya Nepali Adhikar Manch, said the association would convene a meeting on Friday to discuss the fundraising programme. "Some of the people have told me that they are selling their jewellery to help those trapped in Nepal. Our aim is to collect as much funds as we can," she said. Not just members from the community others, including schools, in Patna are chipping in as well. IAS Officers' Association, Bihar branch, member Amita Paul said: "Around 150 members of our organisation have decided to give their one day's salary to the earthquake victims. We will also ask IAS Officers' Wives' Association to donate for the cause."
