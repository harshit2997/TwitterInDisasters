Consular help set up for Canadians in Nepal

Canadians stranded in Nepal after Saturday's devastating earthquake now have a place to go for help getting out of the country, Foreign Affairs Minister Rob Nicholson announced on Tuesday.

"A Canadian consular service point has been established at the Phora Durbar American Club, located in central Kathmandu," Nicholson said in a news release.

"Canadian officials are helping to identify commercial flights and are working on plans to evacuate Canadians to New Delhi using Department of National Defence flights."

The federal government had faced criticism that Canadians in Kathmandu weren't able to get consular support after the earthquake hit.

Canada doesn't have an embassy in Nepal's capital, only an honorary consul.

Eight consular staff have now arrived in Kathmandu, Nicholson said Tuesday, with two more on their way and six others scheduled to arrive in the coming days.

Canadians in Nepal who can't get to the American Club should contact the High Commission of Canada in New Delhi, India or Foreign Affairs' 24-hour emergency watch and response centre, he added.

International Development Minister Christian Paradis also announced the federal government is working with the Canadian Red Cross to set up an emergency health-care unit to treat up to 200 people a day.

On Monday, the government announced the Nepal Earthquake Relief Fund, in which the government will match donations from individual Canadians to registered charities responding to the disaster dollar for dollar.

Over the weekend, the government pledged $5 million in emergency aid to Nepal and deployed the Canadian Forces Disaster Assistance Response Team to the area.

The 7.9-magnitude quake killed at least 4,600 people and rescuers are continuing to search for survivors.
