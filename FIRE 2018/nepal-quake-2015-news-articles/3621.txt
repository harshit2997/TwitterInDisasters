Thailand: war room set up for managing volunteer operations in Nepal
</headline>

<text>
Thailand’s Ministry of Public Health (MOPH) has set up a ‘war room’ overseeing its medical operations in Nepal, under the supervision of Deputy Permanent Secretary Wachira Pengjuntr.



Minister Somsak Chunharas revealed on April 27 that the government is closely monitoring the earthquake situation in Nepal. He explained that the war room functions as the management centre which updates and adjusts rescue operations of Thai medical teams to be deployed in Nepal.



The first team is comprised of only highly-experienced staff from the emergency medical network. They are tentatively scheduled to leave for Nepal on April 29 with medical equipment and supplies.



The minister advised those who plan to help earthquake victims to offer assistance in the form of volunteer groups, in order to avoid confusion and redundant operations.



Those wishing to donate money or necessities are invited to contact the Dhamrongdham Centres throughout the country.



The ministry is also recruiting 5-10 male interpreters who can speak Hindi, English and Thai languages to join the medical volunteers. They will leave Thailand with the first MOPH medical team.-VNA
