Chinese Search and Rescue Team have found survivors under the rubble in Kathmandu, capital of Nepal.

The team arrived in the city earlier this afternoon, less than 24 hours after a massive quake shook most of Nepal and several neighbouring countries, including China.

The team is composed of 69 people and 6 dogs and the group began searching for survivors almost immediately after arriving in Nepal.

Qu Guosheng, vice director of the team, is at the site of a rescue.

"We have already discovered several survivors and started to carry out an urgent rescue mission. We are now in the Northwest of the capital Katmandu. Although we will encounter difficulties during our rescue, I think we will overcome them."

China's charter flight also carried 20 tons of medical and communications equipment and living materials.

The medical gear and medicine is worth 5 million yuan, and should be enough for the emergency treatment for more than 2,000 people.
