Colorado College students urging others to help Nepal

COLORADO SPRINGS, Colo. - Nepali students at Colorado College are urging others to help in the recovery efforts, following a massive earthquake in their home country.



The earthquake in Nepal Saturday killed more than 4,000 people and hurt more than 7,000 others.



"It's devastating to see so many dead bodies, so many missing people, displaced people," said Niyanta Khatri, a sophomore at Colorado College, from Kathmandu, Nepal. "It's been a difficult couple of days for me to be away from family, to be away from home."



Khatri said her family is safe and their home is still standing. They have been staying in tents in the parking lot of their family restaurant, and they have allowed others to stay there too. Khatri estimates about 150 people are there.



"Food and water hasn't been a problem yet, but I can imagine that it will start being a problem because resources are depleting at a very high rate," she said.



Khatri and some high school friends began a fundraising page. She urges others to help too.

"Contribution is definitely what Nepal needs, but it is also important to know where that money goes to, so before people commit and contribute to some donation, to some organization, it is important to do your research," she said. "Red Cross, UNICEF, CARE are the big three organizations that have been making a huge impact in Nepal."

Khatri has also started her own fundraising page.
