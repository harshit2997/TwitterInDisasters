The wreckage of a US Marine helicopter which went missing in Nepal earlier this week has reportedly been found by Nepalese forces 56 kilometers (35 miles) from the capital, Kathmandu.

The Nepalese Defense Ministry said that the wreckage of a missing US Marine helicopter with eight people on board has been discovered about 56km (35 miles) from the Nepalese capital Kathmandu; there is "no chance" of survivors, officials said.

The UH-1Y Huey copter went missing on Tuesday while supplying aid to Nepal, which was hit by a devastating earthquake on April 25.

According to Nepalese Defense Secretary Ishwori Prasad Paudyal, three charred bodies have been pulled from the wreckage of the helicopter, which was spotted on a mountain near the town of Charikot.
