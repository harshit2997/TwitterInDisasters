Nepal: thousands take refuge in streets after devastating earthquake
</headline>

<text>
Thousands of people are being forced to sleep in the streets of the Nepalese capital Kathmandu in the wake of the country’s devastating earthquake.

"We're afraid of aftershocks, because all of the hotels have high floors"

Those out in the cold are the lucky ones. The death toll now stands at well over two-thousand.

“We’ve slept here because we’re afraid of aftershocks, because all of the hotels have high floors. So now we are here and we’re waiting for the situation to improve,” said one French tourist.

The 7.9 magnitude quake struck central Nepal early on Saturday, between the capital and the city of Pokhara.

It reduced buildings and spiritual landmarks to rubble.

People have been told to stay outdoors, as aftershocks continue, including a 6.7 magnitude quake on Sunday.

The focus now is on helping survivors and rescuing those still trapped in the rubble.

Against the odds, a Chinese team has managed to pull a man out from a damaged residential building. He was alive.

As the dead are cremated, the scale of the disaster continues to unfold. There are areas outside Kathmandu yet to be reached.

The worst earthquake in 80 years will leave a lasting scar on the Himalayan nation.

International offers of help for Nepal

Offers of help for Nepal are coming in from around the world.

It is a race against the clock to reach those who may still be alive beneath the rubble.

Checks for casualties and damage continue to be carried out in neighbouring countries, including China, India and Bangladesh, which also felt the quake and aftershocks.
