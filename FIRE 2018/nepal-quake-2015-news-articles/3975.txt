Nepalese communities in Surrey and Hampshire rally together in grief

Nepalese communities in Surrey and Hampshire are rallying together in grief.

On Saturday (25th April) a huge earthquake ripped through their home country.

Some have still not heard from their loved ones, while others know their family are among the dead.

Maya Lama, who lives in the UK, attended a ceremony for the Nepalese community in Aldershot.

She has lost three people in the devastating disaster, including her mum:

"Every Saturday I call her at 6.30pm, but this Saturday I didn't call her.

I really regret it, because if I'd have called her, maybe she would've come out of the house.

If she'd have come out somehow, then maybe I would have my mum today, alive.

She was the most inspiring, for me she is everything.

She always thought of other people and she was my strength as well.

Now I have to be strong."

Earlier, it was confirmed a British national is also among the 5,000 dead.

It is thought this figure will rise to nearly double though, as rescuers begin searching through the rubble.

Maya's family lived in the village of Ghangyoul, she believes aid is not getting there fast enough.

Much of the rescue effort so far has been concentrated on Nepal's capital Kathmandu.

Nothing at all has been heard from some remote villages as the roads are inaccessible.

Thousands of people are still thought to be stranded in mountainous regions, where there have been landslides.

Meanwhile thousands more are injured and thousands are sleeping outside, too frightened to go home.

Nepalese officials have admitted their response to the earthquake has been 'weak'.

The UK has raised Â£9 million pounds for the relief effort so far.



Communities in Surrey and Hampshire are also collecting money, as well as supplies for the survivors of the earthquake.
