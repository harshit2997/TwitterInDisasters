NEPAL â€“ The rescue and recovery after the massive 7.8 magnitude earthquake in Nepal was underway.

On Saturday a photographer from Jackson, California, spoke about his experience during the whole earthquake from the village of Namche Bazar using Skype.

"We all ran out and people around the whole valley here, in the village were screaming, people were jumping out of windows," said photographer Charleton Churchill.

Churchill arrived in Nepal on April 21 with a couple from Denver, Jen Dudley and Erik Tappenbeck.

The mission for the group was to hike and photograph, according to Churchill, the first wedding on Mount Everest with a wedding dress at Basecamp.

He calls it "adventure wedding photography."

They truly got an adventure they weren't expecting when the earthquake hit.

"I was in the shower," said Dudley. "The motion was very soft at first and it takes you a couple seconds to realize what's going on and I yelled to Erik 'oh my god it's an earthquake we need to get out,'" added Dudley.

Churchill said rocks were falling from buildings as the town was in a panic.

"When it first started it was shaking. We thought it was wind, but then it got louder and louder and more violent and that's when everybody ran outside," said Churchill.

Since then, they've been dealing with the aftershocks.

The group said overnight, after the quake happened, they stayed dressed and prepared for anything that could follow.

"We slept in our boots, our parkas, headlamps, backpacks by the door, just in case anything were to happen we had places to go in case there were a major earthquake again," said Churchill.

The trio said many of their sherpas' homes were destroyed and they hoped to hold a fundraiser for their families to rebuild.

As for the wedding, they said it's on hold for the moment and they were working on a new plan.

"Right now in the grand scheme of things delaying a wedding seems nothing compared to the fact that people have lost their homes and people have died. There's more important things to worry about," said Dudley.

The group planned to stay put until they hear it is safe to move. Currently they didn't have any plans to change their current flights back to the United States in couple weeks.

Nepal police officials said on Saturday night at least 1,910 have died, including 721 in Kathmandu, in the quake.
