Tour organiser Gowrishankar, who took the tourists, said members of their group were safe and moved to an open ground, close to Pashupatinath temple.

"Now, all of us are safe in an open ground, close to the Pashupatinath temple in Kathmandu," he told .Gowrishankar further said they were "fortunate" that there was no damage to their hotel even as some buildings in the vicinity collapsed.
