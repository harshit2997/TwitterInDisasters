Calgary community comes together to support children in Nepal

The Calgary community continues to rally together to support those scrambling to recover from the devastation in Nepal after the earthquake in Kathmandu.

Organizer Cory Vo said he wanted to create a community event in order to fundraise for children in need in Nepal. Vo hosted a similar event in 2013 after the typhoon in the Philippines, adding that it’s important to support communities in distress if you have the means to do so.

“I have resources to create these fundraisers,” Vo said. “For myself, I have a two-year-old and we just feel so blessed to live in this country. It’s so tough after a natural disaster…things take years to recover.”

Vo said often after events like this happen in another country, it can be easy to forget what happened and move on to the next thing.

“This event killed more than 8,000 people,” Vo said. “Yes we had a lot of support and donations coming in, but in terms of how we pay attention to these things it’s almost negligible. They’re far off in their own land and we don’t think about them.”

What’s been dubbed “Bazaar for Nepal” will be hosted Saturday at the Inglewood Community Hall. Live bands and an open market are a few of the festivities going on throughout the day, and all funds raised will be donated to the Save the Children charity in Nepal.
