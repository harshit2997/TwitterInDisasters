Israelis who traveled to Kathmandu for surrogate births now fear for their lives, beg rescue services to save them from cold, exposure.

Dozens of Israeli couples are trapped in Kathmandu on Sunday, as they and their newborns wait to head back to Israel after completing surrogate birth.

Several couples expressed to Israeli media fears that rescue workers could take too long to reach them and their infants.

"Our water was cut off," Ohad Hitman, who is in the Nepalese capital with his spouse and newborn twin daughters, stated to Channel 2. "We have bottles of mineral water, enough for the children, but only for 12 hours or one day at the most."

"We are anxious that rescue teams may just not get here," he added, urging the Israeli authorities in charge of the rescue to take into account the tens of couples currently in Kathmandu with newborns.

"The babies can't sleep at night," father Alon Mulian, a Ramat Gan resident also in Kathmandu with his wife, two year-old daughter, and ten-day old newborn, stated to Walla! News. The hotel Mulian and his family are staying in is currently on the verge of collapse.

"We have been offered tents, but it's very cold here," he said. "We are terrified."

"We are trying to make sure the walls don't crash down on us," Mulian added, explaining that he and his family tried the Israeli Embassy, but returned after discovering that building also lacked heat and electricity.

Yosi Filiba, another Israeli stranded in Nepal with his newborn, described the quake.

"I was on the third floor, gathering the daily supply of disposable diapers and food and suddenly everything moved like I'm in a blender," he said. "Instinctively I just took my daughter and I ran out. I was afraid that the building would fall on me."

Nepal's earthquake measured 7.8 on the Richter scale and is the country's worst in 81 years. The IDF, Home Front Command, and Foreign Ministry have already sent a delegation to Kathmandu to begin rescue; Magen David Adom and United Hatzalah teams are due to arrive Sunday afternoon.
