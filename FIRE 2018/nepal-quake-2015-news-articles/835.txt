At least 51 people have died in the earthquake in Bihar that followed a massive temblor in Nepal, Chief Minister Nitish Kumar said and asked his officials on Sunday to send a team to rescue people from his state who are stranded in the quake-hit Himalayan nation.

Officials here said at least 200 people were injured in the state in Saturday's quake.

The casualties included 11 in East Champaran, 9 in Darbhanga, 8 in Sitamarhi, 4 in Madhubani, 3 each in Lakhisarai, Katihar, Samastipur, Siwan and Sheohar, and 2 in Begusarai.

Seven aftershocks occurred on Sunday, forcing people to rush out of their houses and gather at nearby open spaces. The first tremors were felt around 12.40 p.m.

Patna's Gandhi Maidan was packed with people. Thousands of people spent a sleepless night on Saturday outside their houses following the quake.

Nitish Kumar visited the ground and spoke with the people.

He later held a high-level meeting with officials and ordered the setting up of a team to bring back people from Bihar who were stranded in quake-hit Nepal.

Nitish Kumar also ordered the setting up of four camps in the districts bordering Nepal to help in rescue efforts in the neighbouring country.

Speaking to IANS, state disaster management principal secretary Vyas Ji said people should not give credence to rumours that were flooding social networking sites, and should not panic.

Union ministers Ram Vilas Paswan and Radha Mohan Singh, who are from Bihar, also met people in the state capital and took stock of the situation.
