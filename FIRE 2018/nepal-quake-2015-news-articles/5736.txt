Manningtree High School pupils get quizzical for Nepal relief fund

Pupils Mitchell Simpson, James Fulford and Harry Boutell read books to then take quizzes at Manningtree High School raising money for Accelerated Reader's Nepal appeal on Friday, 1 May.

Pupils at a north Essex school completed more than 140 quizzes today in a bid to raise funds for victims of the Nepal earthquake.

The Manningtree High School students pitched in with an attempt to complete 100,000 accelerated reader quizzes from Renaissance Learning in one day.

The company pledged to donate £1,000 to Medecins Sans Frontieres (Doctors Without Borders) for its work helping survivors of the Nepal earthquake last Saturday.

Schools taking part were also trying to win books worth £1,000 if they did the most for a school.

Pupils not only had to take the quizzes for them to be added to the total, but also score at least 85%.

Carole Hughes, assistant headteacher, said: “We are delighted with the enthusiastic way in which our students took part in this excellent initiative today.

“On average, our students normally complete around 16 quizzes a day. Today, they completed almost 120 and we very much hope that, collectively, the schools taking part manage to achieve the 100,000 target in order to raise £1,000 for the Nepal Earthquake Relief Fund.”
