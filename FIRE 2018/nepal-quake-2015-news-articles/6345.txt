A Stillwater resident who was in Nepal when the 7.8 magnitude earthquake struck the region on April 25 is safe after a 7.3 magnitude earthquake that hit the region on Tuesday.

Wendie Blanchard, mother of Ian Blanchard, said she woke up around 6 a.m. Tuesday and was checking her iPad when she found out about Tuesday's earthquake.

The Associated Press reported at least 37 people were killed and 1,100 were injured in the seismic event. The April 25 quake killed more than 8,150 people.

I didn't hear anything until around 11 (a.m.), Blanchard said of her son's safety.

Blanchard said her son is currently in Kathmandu. His plan is still to board a return flight to the U.S. on May 14. After a couple of connection flights, Ian Blanchard is set to arrive in Paris, France before boarding a plane to New York.

He should be arriving at John F. Kennedy Airport around 1 p.m. on Thursday, she said.
