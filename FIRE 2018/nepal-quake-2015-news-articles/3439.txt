SAN DIEGO – San Diegans were coordinating efforts Monday to raise funds for friends and loved ones affected by the devastating earthquake in Nepal.

Members of Nepalese community and UCSD Nepalese Student Association said it’s tough to see the widespread destruction caused by the 7.8 magnitude earthquake on Saturday and were keenly aware of the urgent need for aid.

Nitya Timalsina and her brother Ishan thumbed through a family photo album worried about their relatives living in the capitol of Nepal, Kathmandu. She told FOX5 being here in San Diego makes it difficult to see the chaotic images happening on the other side of the world.

“There have been entire villages that are completely flattened. It’s not even a village anymore," said Timalsina. “That’s my other grandmother who is pretty much blind, she can’t see and I don’t even know how she is right now."

“We’re so worried and it’s been so hard to get in touch with all of them and we haven’t heard from a lot of people and it’s just really scary," she said.

Timalsina joined other students with channeling their frustration into providing aid to their homeland. The students are organizing and have set up an online fundraising page along with PayPal to help assist their loved ones and others in need in Nepal.

“I’m so grateful for the support of the San Diego community it’s beyond what we expected," said Timalsina. “We’ve had limited contact with them some of them have reached out to us but any contact that we’ve had is brief and it’s very troubling.”

In addition a San Diego-Based International Relief Team has already sent relief aid to victims of the earthquake. The team has already sent a shipment of emergency medicine that will be airlifted to Nepal and those displaced or injured in the quake.

The students will also be holding a candlelight vigil in front of the Geisel library at Tuesday at 7 p.m.

International Relief Teams are also accepting donations online and at their San Diego facility. Items and money can be mailed to International Relief Teams Attn: Nepal Earthquake, 4560 Alvarado Canyon Road, Suite 2G, San Diego, CA 92120.
