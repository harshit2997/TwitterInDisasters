PH Red Cross seeks cash donations for Nepal
</headline>

<text>
MANILA - Philippine Red Cross (PRC) Chairman Richard Gordon said it’s the turn of Filipinos to respond to other people in need, especially those in Nepal.

“The people of Nepal are suffering immensely right now…PRC is appealing to our kababayans here and abroad to donate in cash for Nepal Red Cross to and through the PRC for support to the most vulnerable people of Nepal,” Gordon said.

He said the whole world helped the Philippines in its time of need after the Yolanda destruction.

A magnitude 7.8 earthquake devastated Nepal on Saturday afternoon, resulting in the deaths of more than 3,000 people.



Organizations said a humanitarian crisis is in the offing because of limited funds and access to devastated areas.

The PRC appealed for cash donations for faster and more efficient delivery of humanitarian services. PRC’s accounts are as follows:
