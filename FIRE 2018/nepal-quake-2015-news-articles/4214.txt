PETALING JAYA - Members of the Tzu Chi Foundation Malaysia have arrived in Kathmandu with one tonne in medical supplies for 1,000 people.

The foundation said in a statement that the disaster and medical relief team arrived at Nepal's capital on Tuesday at 2.02pm local time.

The 15-member team, led by Dr Chien Sou-hsin, immediately contacted the medical group set up at the airport and is expected to launch surgical, emergency aid and internal medicine services today.

The foundation said the team comprised members from Malaysia, Thailand, India, Philippines and the United States.

"As they are experienced in international disaster relief, they will conduct a survey at the disaster area and make preliminary plans for the delivery of food, eco-blankets, multi-purpose folding beds and so on," it said.

The members would then report to the Tzu Chi Disaster Command Centre in Taiwan, which would then arrange for shipment of relief items.

The foundation has also started its "Send Love to Nepal" initiative to raise funds to help earthquake victims.

Those who wish to contribute can contact Tzu Chi KL and Selangor branch at 03-6256 3800.

Another non-profit organisation, Insaf Malaysia, said its first rapid assessment team would help out with medical emergencies and collect information on the needs of the disaster-struck country.

Organisation founder/president Ishak Abdul Kadir, who is also its Nepal Earthquake Mission coordinator, said the first team was scheduled to leave on Friday.

Insaf Malaysia, a technical relief organisation, would subsequently mobilise three more missions to provide aid for shelter needs, food, wash and health clusters.

It has also set up the "Insaf Malaysia Earthquake Fund for Nepal", targeting to raise RM100,000 (S$37,000) to help the victims.

Those who wish to contribute can donate funds to "Insaf Malaysia" (Maybank account number: 562188306090 or CIMB account number: 8600184578).
