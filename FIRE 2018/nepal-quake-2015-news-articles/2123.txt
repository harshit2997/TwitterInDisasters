India will rush more help to the quake-hit Nepal, said Union health minister Jagat Parkash Nadda here on Sunday.

Talking with reporters, Nadda said: "We have already sent a team of medical expert, including 34 doctors and paramedical staff, to provide treatment for the disaster-hit people in Nepal. India has also sent 10 orthopaedic surgeons and two anaesthetists and if more medical help is needed, it will be provided as per the directions of the Union home ministry," added Nadda.

"A consignment of 15 metric tonnes of medicine has already been sent to Nepal. The government will also send packets of bleaching powder in a couple of days," he said.

India is in constant touch with the Nepal government and every possible help would be provided to the Himalayan country, he added.

"Army operation theatre cabs have already reached Nepal with a team of surgeons and medical experts to treat the injured," the health minister said.

He said every possible help would be provided to the states of Bihar, Uttar Pradesh and others, which have been hit by earthquake. The Union government was monitoring the situation closely, he said.

Nadda also cut short his tour to Himachal and rushed to Delhi on Sunday to discuss arrangements for the relief and rescue operation in the quake-hit Indian states and Nepal with the home ministry.

In reply to a question, Nadda said the Union government was efforts to strengthen health sector in the country. "As conclusive development is our prime concern, dearth of funds will not hinder growth in the hill state," he said.
