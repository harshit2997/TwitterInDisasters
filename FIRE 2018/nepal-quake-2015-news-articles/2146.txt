While the death toll passes 4,000 and aftershocks continue to rumble across Nepal, some Treasure Valley families are anxious to get updates from loved ones who were in the region when the massive earthquake shook the South Asian region.One of them, Boise native Charlie Linville, is a former staff sergeant in the U.S. Marines who lost his right leg during a 2011 explosion in Afghanistan. Linville, who was planning to scale Mount Everest, is part of The Heroes Project, which is currently at a base camp on the north side of Earth's highest mountain."Another major aftershock felt today," posted The Heroes Project on its Facebook page today. Linville has told relatives that the team is reassessing the climb in the wake of the aftershocks.Earlier today, another climber posted a terrifying video of an avalanche striking another Mount Everest base camp (see the first video below).Meanwhile, KTVB-TV reports that another Boise native, David Tomasini, who has been teaching in Kathmandu, has assured his Idaho relatives that he and his students are safe, and he'll be returning to Boise this June (see the second video below).
