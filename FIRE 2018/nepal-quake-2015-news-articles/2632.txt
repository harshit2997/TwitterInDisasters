PASADENA (CBSLA.com) — As the death toll rises following the 7.8-magnitude earthquake in Nepal, local authorities and volunteers continue to offer support Tuesday.

A 10-person task force with Reach Out WorldWide, a nonprofit relief organization founded by the late Paul Walker, will be joined by a few Pasadena firefighters, a doctor and other medical professionals as they travel to the earthquake-stricken area.

“That’s what we strive to do, is to go to places that aren’t necessarily getting all of the attention to create awareness,” Paul’s brother Cody Walker said.

He said they will plan on focusing on areas that need the most help.

“So many of the different neighboring villages have been completely cut off due to landslides, and the rain is not helping with that at all.”

The group plans on staying for a week bringing food, medicine and a little hope.

“It’s horrible. These people don’t have that much as it is, and so when something like this happens it just completely overwhelms everything, so we’re anxious to get over there,” Walker said.

The international non-profit group Waves for Water, based in Los Angeles, said Monday they will also head to Nepal to deliver large amounts of water filters.

Just one filter, according to officials, can provide up to 1,000,000 gallons of clean water. The team plans to bring 500 of them to the region.

The California Task Force Two (CA-TF2) team, made up of 57 Southland firefighters, deployed Sunday after the devastating earthquake hit.

The team responds to disasters both in Southern California and abroad. They partner with FEMA for any domestic response and the United States Agency for International Development/Office of U.S. Foreign Disaster Assistance during international missions.

An El Segundo-based rescue organization Team Rubicon was also sent to the area.
