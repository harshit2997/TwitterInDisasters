The Bermuda Red Cross is urging the public to lend a hand to support those affected by devastating earthquakes in Nepal.

A 7.9 magnitude earthquake struck the country on Saturday, destroying buildings in the capital of Kathmandu, killing more than 4,000 and injuring at least 7,000.

The epicentre of the earthquake was in Lamjung, about 80km from Kathmandu, with most of the reported fatalities occurring in the Kathmandu valley, where buildings in densely populated areas collapsed.

In the aftermath of the disaster, the Bermuda Red Cross has launched a cash appeal to support the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescents efforts to help those affected.

Jagan Chapagain, the IFRCs director for Asia Pacific, said: We are extremely concerned about the fate of communities in towns and villages in rural areas closer to the epicentre.

Access roads have been damaged or blocked by landslides and communications lines are down, preventing us from reaching local Red Cross branches to get accurate information. We anticipate that there will be considerable destruction and loss of life.

The Nepal Red Cross Society has extensive experience in responding to natural disasters and plays a lead role in the Nepal Governments contingency plans. Emergency responders from the Red Cross trained in first aid, and search and rescue have been mobilised to affected areas. The organisations blood bank in Kathmandu is also providing blood supplies to the main medical facilities in the capital.

The IFRC is mobilising resources from its hubs in New Delhi, Kuala Lumpur and Bangkok, and is releasing funds from its Disaster Response Emergency Fund to support the initial emergency response. International assistance is hindered by the closure of the Kathmandu airport.

Nepals National Society for Earthquake Technology had previously estimated that a large-scale earthquake in mid-Nepal could displace more than 1.8 million people, kill more than 100,000 and injure a further 300,000.

We do not yet know the scope of damage, but no doubt this is the most deadly and devastating earthquake since the 1934 tremor which devastated Nepal and Bihar, Mr Chapagain said. People will need considerable support including food, water, medical care and emergency shelter.

Anyone who would like to make a donation to help support efforts are asked to make direct deposits into either of the two following accounts:

HSBC Bank of Bermuda account: 010-187417-012
