In this video, a BBC reporter is clearly impressed by the field hospital that Israel set up in Nepal after the recent devastating earthquake.

BBC has been known for what appeared to be a strong bias against Israel. Yet even the BBC had to give credit to Israel for the incredible work it has been doing in Nepal since the disastrous earthquake that rocked the country over a week ago.

Aside from India, Israel has provided more support to Nepal than any other country. Not bad for little Israel, a country approximately the size of New Jersey.
