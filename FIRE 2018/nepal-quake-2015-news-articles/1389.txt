DEVASTATED Bhutanese migrants in Launceston have banded together in an effort to raise funds for victims of the earthquake in Nepal.

A 7.8-magnitude quake rocked the east Asian area on Saturday.

It was the largest earthquake in Nepal in more than 80 years.

On Monday, the death toll rose above 3700 people, while more than 6500 people have been reported injured.

There are at least two Tasmanians still listed missing in Nepal.

Bhutanese migrants Shiva and Hem Acharya door-knocked throughout Launceston well into Monday night.

The pair, who arrived in Australia in 2010, want to raise $2000 for the victims of the earthquake by Tuesday night.

"We're shocked. We have not slept since we heard," Shiva said.

"We pray for the Australians that are over there as well and the people from Launceston."

As of Monday night, Shiva and Hem had raised $250.

Kings Meadows resident Susan Richardson helps fund a child care centre for disadvantaged children in Nepal.

The child care centre, known as the Butterfly Foundation, has temporarily been turned into a medical centre.

Ms Richardson has also faced an anxious wait to hear about the safety and wellbeing of her friends, but heard on Monday they were alive and well.

"The country was not set up for an event like this," she said.

"The government has an earthquake protocol set up over there, but their roads and buildings can't handle something like that."

The Launceston Nepali Christian Fellowship has also vowed to send support to Nepal in the coming weeks, while the Australian Bhutanese Society of Northern Tasmanian also aims to raise funds.

Launceston's Bhutanese community have encouraged donations to be made to victims of the earthquake through Red Cross, Oxfam and Doctors Without Borders.

Ms Richardson will also be collecting donations to send to Nepal.

Donations to the Butterfly Foundation can be made by contacting Ms Richardson on 0417 750 672, or via the Butterfly Children Facebook page.
