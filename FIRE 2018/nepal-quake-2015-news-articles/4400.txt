Foreign Secretary S. Jaishankar will visit quake-hit Kathmandu on Friday to take stock of the situation.

According to reports, National Security Advisor Ajit Doval would also be accompanying the Foreign Secretary during his visit to Nepal.

The death toll due to the earthquake in Nepal has now climbed over 5,200. The figure may go up when the rescuers reach the remote areas.

Heavy rain affected the relief and rescue operations in places including Kathmandu. As a result, multi-national rescue teams found it difficult to locate survivors of the disaster.

Aid has now begun reaching the remote regions.
