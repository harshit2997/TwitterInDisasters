Dr. Rob Casserley and his fiancee, Marie-Kristelle Ross have survived the avalanches on Mount Everest that were triggered by Saturday's earthquake in Nepal.

Casserly, 39, is a general practitioner who has done replacement work for other doctors on Prince Edward Island.

In an email to CBC P.E.I. earlier this morning, Casserley said he was at Camp One on Mount Everest, partway up the mountain, when the earthquake hit.

The earthquake triggered avalanches from several different directions.

"I thought we were going to take a big hit, but in the end, just a minor shock wave and heavy dusting," Casserley wrote in a Facebook post.

"The noise at the time was terrifying, and worse still because we were already in heavy cloud, so couldn't see where subsequent avalanches were coming from."

Casserley said, "In the end, we were in the safest place."

The doctor lost three of his Nepalese support members. They were among the 17 people killed when an avalanche tore through Everest base camp. This is Casserley's eighth trip to Everest.

"We have picked ourselves up. Still in a state of shock," Casserley wrote.

"Now with [mobile data access] we realize we are just an infinitesimally small part of a dreadful Nepali tragedy."

Casserley and Ross, of Quebec, are heading to Kathmandu to help with recovery efforts.

"We will do all we can to help," Casserley wrote.
