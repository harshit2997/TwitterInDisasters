SAN FRANCISCO, May 7, 2015 /PRNewswire/ -- Blubond.com is harnessing the power of e-commerce to help raise funds for the relief missions in Nepal. Consumers of eco-friendly products and supporters of emerging designers can purchase with a purpose today at www.blubond.com and put their spending dollars directly into the hands of preeminent First Responder, International Medical Corps, a humanitarian organization providing urgently needed health care to earthquake survivors. 90 cents of every dollar donated to International Medical Corps directly supports their humanitarian programs on the ground in over 35 countries, providing vulnerable families with medical care, supplies, and medicines. They currently have doctors, nurses and mobile medical units operating in Nepal and will stay long-term to train local health workers to care for survivors. By purchasing the Mistura Blu-Tempus watch specifically through www.blubond.com, $94.00 will be sent to assist survivors with lifesaving medical supplies. Likewise, by purchasing the Cashmere Love Scarf from California designer Artistix, $73.00 will be translated into emergency care. Jewelry designer Jessica Robinson is also joining forces by offering her sterling silver Hopi Tapuat Necklace as a "Direct 2 Nepal" purchase, donating $54.00 with each necklace sold. Lastly, Blubond's own Blu-Rose Elixir, their signature organic rosewater, will offer up $13.00 per bottle to International Medical Corp's lifesaving efforts. Blubond.com is a luxury e-commerce site dedicated to supporting ethically produced products and socially conscious designers. By partnering with honorable charities, they allow consumers a new way to shop for handcrafted, designer goods by donating a significant portion of the proceeds to help make a difference in people's lives. Due to the urgent necessity for fundraising for Nepal, they are quickly mobilizing their efforts and directing donations to assist those most in need. Blubond.com and International Medical Corps are currently utilizing the hashtag #D2N Direct 2 Nepal as a call to action across all social media platforms.
