Nepal quake: Camp conditions 'disgusting'
</headline>

The Government's doubling New Zealand's donation to Nepal's disaster relief fund, adding another $1 million to the first.

The death toll from Saturday's deadly 7.8-magnitude earthquake has risen to more than 5000 people, but the country's Prime Minister is warning that number could top 10,000.

Conditions in Nepal have got even worse in the past 24 hours, with torrential rain adding to the misery mix. Even on a good day, makeshift camps in the centre of Kathmandu are miserable places â€“ but after an hour of heavy rain, they're even worse.

With more rain forecast for next week, the city's post-earthquake housing crisis is about to become critical.

"The government isn't providing anything," says one of the city's residents, who is living under a tarpaulin with his family. "Their shelters are wet, they don't have good mattresses and their children are sick."

Another woman says her family have all been sick after they were provided with dirty drinking water. She said the sanitation at the camp was "disgusting".

Kiwi nurse Alyssa Lowe has just returned from a Himalayan trek after it was cut short by the quake. She wants to use her skills to help, but doesn't know where to start.

"There's just so much," she says. "We need adequate housing, adequate shelter. This isn't adequate."

Ms Lowe says the people of Nepal desperately need food, medical assistance and supplies.

"I guess the list just goes on."

There are stories of international aid agencies' efforts being hampered by poor Nepalese infrastructure. The future looks bleak.

It's estimated around 25,000 people are living in makeshift camps. While some say they want to leave, the reality is that number is actually going to get bigger.

It's been four days since the earthquake, and today the Nepalese government announced it wants to get the survivors off the streets and back into their homes. It's worried the camps are becoming breeding grounds for disease.
