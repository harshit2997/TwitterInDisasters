KUALA LUMPUR: Special Malaysia Disaster Assistance and Rescue Team (SMART) is now waiting for the green light to be dispatched to Nepal to help in efforts to rescue victims of an earthquake which rocked the country, yesterday.

National Security Council (MKN) secretary Datuk Mohamed Thajudeen Abdul Wahab said SMART was ready for mobilisation at any time and was only waiting for flight clearance from the Indian authorities.

"Currently, we cannot depart and are still waiting for flight clearance from India. When we get the green light, we will fly there for a search and rescue operation for the earthquake victims and also bring home Malaysian citizens," he said when contacted by Bernama tonight.

He said 30 members of SMART and 20 doctors from Mercy Malaysia and the Malaysian Red Crescent Society would join the aid mission.

In addition, Malaysia would also be sending equipment and medical supplies using the Royal Malaysian Air Force's Charlie 130 aircraft.

The earthquake measuring 7.9 on the Richter scale hit Nepal in the area between its capital, Kathmandu and the town of Pokhara, at 2.56pm (Malaysian time) yesterday.

To date, the earthquake, the worst in Nepal for 81 years, killed 2,150 people, including 22 who were attempting to climb Mount Everest. â€“ Bernama
