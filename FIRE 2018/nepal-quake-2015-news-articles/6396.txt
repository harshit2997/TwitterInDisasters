CHENNAI: More than 500 members of the Brahmakumaris organisation, along with the general public on the Marina Beach on Sunday evening took part at the group meditation programmme titled Anjali, for the benefit of those affected by the Nepal earthquake. The event, which was organised by Brahmakumari Beena, the service coordinator of Tamil Nadu Zone, was held in order to relinquish the physical, inner, mental peace and sorrow.

In the two-hour meditation session headed Jansy, Ranjani, Vijayalakshmi and Chitra, meditations were conducted with commentaries on god realisation, thoughts of consolation to the victims of disaster, positive vibrations towards nature, and spreading peace to fellow beings of the planet.

Brahmakumari Chitra, who held one of the sessions, asked those meditating to think of the damaged houses in Nepal being renovated. “Good wishes act as medicine in many instances such as accidents, disaster and calamities. The power of silence heals us emotionally, mentally, intellectually, spiritually and to an extent even physically,” said a press release from the organisation.
