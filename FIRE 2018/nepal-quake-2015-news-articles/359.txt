Kathmandu, Apr. 25 (ANI): Yoga Guru Baba Ramdev on Saturday said that he had a narrow escape from death as the dais from which he was addressing a gathering in Kathmandu, collapsed right after he got down from the stage.

"I thank god that my program ended just a minute before the earthquake struck. As soon as I got out of it, a five to six storied building fell down like a house of cards. There were trees falling around. I couldn't get hold of what was happening and when I did I saw a few people lying on the floor with severe injuries," said Ramdev.

"From Pokhra to Kathmandu, a lot of people have been killed. My condolences are with the people of Nepal," he added.

The death toll in Nepal from the powerful earthquake rose to between 688 and 711, with 181 people killed in the capital Kathmandu.

Tremors were felt as far as in New Delhi and other northern and eastern cities, where people ran out of their offices and houses. (ANI)
