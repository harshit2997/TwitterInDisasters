Nepalese Baptists, along with many international relief organizations, are actively engaged in responding to the April 25 Nepal earthquake.

The Nepal Baptist Church Council is providing immediate food, shelter and medical needs, including offering trauma healing and spiritual support, the Baptist World Alliance reported today.

The organization, which is a BWA member group, had recently delivered up to 540 tents to quake victims and provided medical assistance to 245 people.

And even their own members are suffering in the aftermath of the quake that killed at least 8,400 in the mostly Hindu nation.

Baptist Christians are “also experiencing life under the tent here in Nepal,” NBCC Coordinator John Narayan told the alliance.

But victims don’t have to be Baptist to receive help from NBCC. Aid has been distributed by the group to residents in Kathmandu, Sankhu, Manikhel, Bukhel, Chaughare, Chhampi and Sangogaun, all of which are located in Lalitpur district.

The Baptist Church of Mizoram, a BWA member in India, has also lent assistance to quake survivors in Nepal. It has sent aid and personnel to distribute food and safe drinking water.

Donations for relief may be sent to Baptist World Aid.

Other groups raising funds for relief are:

• American Baptist Churches USA.



• Baptist General Association of Virginia.

• Baptist General Convention of Texas

• Baptist Global Response.

• Baptist World Mission.

• Cooperative Baptist Fellowship.
