Known as the Himalayan country, Nepal was hit by a devastating earthquake last week. India is putting in efforts to help the country. Apart from the government, now Indian e-commerce companies have stepped forward to contribute to the best of their endeavours.

E-commerce players like Paytm, Shopclues, Ola and FreeCharge have started various campaigns to aid the massive destruction. The situation can be understood by the death toll which has surpassed the 10,000 mark as of now. Nepal is in dire need of supplies and funds to help them all who are affected with this massacre.

Online wallet provider Paytm has asked its users to donate any amount they feel while using Paytm services. In return, Paytm will donate double the amount donated by its users. This donation can range from Rs. 10 to Rs. 1000.

Likewise, online shopping portal ShopClues has decided to match the amount donated through its portal to accumulate twice the amount to "ShopClues Nepal Relief Fund". This amount will then be transferred to WFP (World Food Programme) in a bid to provide quality food for the masses. This donation will range from Rs. 50 to Rs. 15000.

Apart from these, online cab and auto rickshaw provider Ola have requested their users to the PM's Fund using its mobile app. This can be done using simple promo code using process, which is as same as the recharge process on the app. Ola will donate a total of 15 lakh to the fund.

Last but not the least, mobile recharge and coupon app FreeCharge has made a unique campaign. The company has promised to donate Rs. 20 for every missed call they receive on 09599-666-222. Also they would provide the callers a Rs. 20 recharge vouchers.
