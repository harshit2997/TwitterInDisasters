Worcester paramedic takes trip in Nepal PM's helicopter to save injured woman

A FLIGHT in the Prime Minister of Nepal's private helicopter helped a Worcester paramedic save a seriously injured woman's life.

West Midlands Ambulance Service's Phil Llewellyn, from Norton, is helping out in the disaster-stricken country which is reeling from two earthquakes.

Dad-of-two Mr Llewellyn was posted to Charikot, near the epicentre of the second quake, alongside fellow paramedic Ed Hullah,

The pair were treating an elderly Nepali woman on Thursday who had suffered a traumatic head injury after a landslide caused by the latest earthquake.

Nepal's Prime Minister Sushil Koirala was also visiting Charikot – around 43 miles east of Kathmandu – at the same time.

The woman was in desperate need of hospital treatment, but there was no means to fly her to the capital.

With no other helicopters available to evacuate the stricken woman to Kathmandu, the paramedics asked to borrow the Prime Minister's helicopter and he agreed.

Mr Llewellyn, Mr Hullah and a Nepalese anaesthetist were then flown to Nepalese army hospital in the country's capital and they managed to keep th injured lady alive until they arrived.

The "bizarre morning" was completed when they flew back to Charikot and "thanked [the PM] for the ride".

Mr Llewellyn's wife Liz said she was proud of her husband, whose selfless exploits have seen him make international headlines.

She said: "He phoned to say they had to get a helicopter to help an elderly woman – but it just happened to be an important helicopter.

"The lady has thankfully survived – she's critical but OK.

"I'm not surprised [at what Phil did], he's always thinking of the patients and what they need.

"If there's a problem he will try to work out the solutions."

Mrs Llewellyn added: "I don't really think he can believe [the coverage], it's like 'we came out her to to help and all of a sudden we're on the international news'.

"That's not why he went out there and I think he is struggling a bit with the attention.

"But the more that keeps it fresh in people's minds the better."
