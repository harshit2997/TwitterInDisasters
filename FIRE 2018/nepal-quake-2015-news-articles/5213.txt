School raises cash for teacher’s kin in Nepal

Bookcliff Middle School students and staff are collecting money to help a Bookcliff teacher’s family in Nepal rebuild after their homes were destroyed in the April 25 earthquake.

Manju Shrestha, a seventh-grade science teacher at the school, visits her family in Nepal every summer, according to colleague Kylee Castle. After the earthquake struck, Shrestha planned to forgo that trip this year and send the money she would have used on plane fare to her family. Castle sent an email to other Bookcliff staff members urging them to find a way to raise enough money to allow Shrestha to take the trip and collect money to help her family rebuild.

Ideas began rolling in immediately. The next few weeks are booked solid with fundraising efforts.

Castle raised about $300 Wednesday with an after-school root beer float fundraiser. Other teachers have handed her checks, organized a dodge ball tournament and a staff chili lunch. A silent auction that will run May 11-15 and donations collected at a school-wide talent show at 6 p.m. next Tuesday night will be donated to Shrestha’s family.

Students have organized a daily after-school concession stand that sells popcorn, candy and chips near the front office. There’s also a donation jar at the front office and kids can make a donation in exchange for the privilege to wear sunglasses to school next Thursday or hats today. There’s also a bake sale after school today.

On the last day of school, May 20, kids can pay $1 to get a teacher in a dunk tank.

“I’m sure that will be the biggest money-maker,” Castle joked, adding on a more serious note, “We may not have the highest socioeconomic population but our kids pull together and our families pull together. It’s definitely a school effort.”

Castle said Shrestha is shy and still too upset by the earthquake to participate in an interview. But she passed along the message through Castle that she appreciates the support of her school family.

“She was extremely grateful for us pulling together for her and for us providing emotional support,” Castle said.

Anyone who wants to make a donation to Shrestha’s family can contact the Bookcliff Middle School office at 254-6220.
