Cal State Fullerton professor leading earthquake research in Nepal

FULLERTON – A Cal State Fullerton professor who was born in Nepal will head back to the country next week to co-lead a group researching potential post-earthquake hazards and building integrity.

“For me personally, I’m very happy that I would be able to contribute a little bit to the country that gave me everything,” said Binod Tiwari, a civil and environmental engineering professor.

On Saturday, Nepal was devastated by a magnitude-7.8 earthquake. Reports so far say more than 6,000 have died.

The area of Nepal where Tiwari grew up, Gorkha, was nearly leveled. But the two family members still in the country, his mother and sister, are both OK, he said.

Tiwari will travel with 11 other experts from the Geotechnical Extreme Event Reconnaissance Team, a program sponsored by the National Science Foundation that conducts research after disasters. Among issues the team will look at are the potential for landslides and why some buildings crumbled while others remained standing.

He also traveled to Japan as part of the team after its 2011 earthquake.

The hope, Tiwari said, is that the research will help countries, including Nepal, be better prepared for future earthquakes.

“We need to get evidence before it disappears,” he said. “Whatever codes are made are based on our knowledge.”

Tiwari will leave Monday with the first half of the research team. The second half will arrive in mid-May. Tiwari will return May 30 to teach summer classes, and will go back to Nepal in August.
