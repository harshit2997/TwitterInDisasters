West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee today left for the Indo-Nepal border in Darjeeling district to oversee relief measures being taken in the wake of the devastating temblor that hit the neighbouring country on April 25.



Banerjee told newsmen at Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose International Airport that she was carrying with her certain things that the Nepal government had sought.



"There is scarcity of some things in Nepal which its government has sought from us. I am carrying those things," she said.Banerjee, however, did not give any details on it.The chief minister who visited north Bengal a day after the quake on Arpil 25, said she would proceed to the border directly after reaching Bagdogra airport.North Bengal reported three deaths - one each in Jalpaiguri, Naxalbari and Siligurim due to the quake. Several injured have been admitted to the government hospital in Siliguri.
