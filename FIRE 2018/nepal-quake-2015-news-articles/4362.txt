You'll Believe in Miracles After Seeing This Baby & Other Survivors Pulled From Rubble in Nepal Days After Catastrophic Earthquake
</headline>

"I had very little hope that they had survived. I didn't hear any sound at all," mother of two Rasmila Awal told CNN after her 5-month-old son Sonies was pulled from the rubble of their family's collapsed home 22 hours after the earthquake. Awal recalled just having left the house when the quake hit and she watched it collapse.

Her 10-year-old daughter, Soniya, was found about two hours later—but the image of Sonies' improbably rescue instantly went viral and became a nationwide symbol of hope. Awal said that the family camped in a field next to the ruins of their house and they could hear Sonies' cries but were unable to reach him. After nearly a day of digging, a soldier from the Nepalese army pulled the baby—who had only suffered minor injuries—from the wreckage.

"When I saw the baby alive all my sorrow went," photojournalist Amul Thapa, who took the viral pic of Awal, recounted the experience to reporters. "Everyone was clapping. It gave me energy and made me smile in spite of lots of pain hidden inside me."

While the photo of Sonies won the Internet with sheer adorable-baby-combined-with-hope-and-resilience power, the latest stories, about a teenage boy and a woman in her 20s being rescued after five days trapped under collapsed buildings, have caused yet another proverbial global standing ovation.
