A Huntsville woman who survived the Nepal earthquake has returned home.

Beverly Brown, the Huntsville woman trapped in Nepal after the deadly earthquake hit last weekend, arrived Friday evening at Huntsville International airport and was greeted by plenty of family and friends.

“We all rushed towards each other the three of us embraced and the three of us just sat there hugged and hugged and cried and hugged and told each other we loved each other,” said Hunter Brown, Beverly Brown's son. “To have her back here again. To have her back in our arms feels absolutely wonderful."

Beverly Brown was with a tour group in Nepal when a massive earthquake hit last week and her group became caught in a mudslide.

Brown was rescued Wednesday following the earthquake, according to Madison County Commission Chairman Dale Strong.

The earthquake hit Nepal on April 25 at about 4 p.m. and killed more than 4,800 people and left more than 9,200 injured, according to CNN.

Brown's daughter, Rachel Brown Matthews, said she talked to her mother on the phone Wednesday morning.

The family used Twitter and Facebook to track down leads on Brown and they received help from around the world.

They said they got help from local and national politicians and people in Nepal.

Brown's family says they are forever grateful to the lawmakers, the military personnel, and all the volunteers that helped find their mom. For that reason, they say they are planning to give back and specifically help the family of the tour guide who helped their mother get to safety.

“Please help these people who saved her life,” said daughter, Rachel Brown Matthews. “They didn't know us, and they lost everything.”

The family set up an account at First National Bank called the Beverly Brown Rescue Fund. The money goes directly to the rescuer's family.

One thing you always have to keep in mind, unfortunately, are the scammers who set up fake accounts to take advantage of your generosity.

Remember, you can go to sites like Guidestaror Charity Navigator to ensure the charity you are donating to is legitimate.
