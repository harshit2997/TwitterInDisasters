GENEVA, 29th April 2015 (WAM) - The United Arab Emirates has renewed solidarity with the people affected by the devastating earthquake which hit Nepal and pledged to continue its support to them in these difficult times.

This came during a speech delivered today by Obaid Salem Al Zaabi, UAE Permanent Representative to the UN and other international organisations in Geneva before a meeting organised by UN's Office for the Coordination of Human Affairs (OCHA) in Geneva to launch an appeal to provide vital relief to people affected by the earthquake in Nepal.

Al Zaabi highlighted UAE's quick response in aiding Nepal under the directives of President His Highness Sheikh Khalifa bin Zayed Al Nahyan and orders of His Highness Sheikh Mohamed bin Zayed Al Nahyan, Crown Prince of Abu Dhabi and Deputy Supreme Commander of the UAE Armed Forces.

Khalifa Foundation sent emergency relief materials to Nepal, while teams from the Foundation headed to India and Nepal to oversee relief operations and to purchase materials from the local markets there.

A team of professionals from the Interior Ministry also left to Nepal to participate in the international search and rescue operations.

Vice President and Prime Minister of the UAE and Ruler of Dubai, High Highness Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum, ordered an air bridge to supply aid to the earthquake victims.

Sheikh Mohammed also directed instructions for a donation of 100,000 units of "Salma Halal Food" the ready-to-eat meals dedicated for emergency responses.

The first Boeing 747 took off from Dubai heading to Kathmandu airport with the first 90 metric tonnes of aid. The total volume of shipment that shall be sent through the air bridge will exceed 450 metric tonnes and include aid items consisting of emergency health kits, water purification units, water storage and distribution units, blankets, tents, tarpaulin, jerry cans, buckets, plastic sheets, solar lamps, ICT equipment and food items.

Al Zaabi also noted that H.H. Sheikha Fatima bint Mubarak, Chairwoman of the General Women's Union (GWU), Supreme Chairwoman of the Family Development Foundation (FDF) and President of the Supreme Council for Motherhood and Childhood, donated AED 5 million to provide relief for victims of Nepal's earthquake.
