In a 1 a.m. Monday call to his father in Nepal, University at Albany doctoral student Baibhav Rajbhandari was overwhelmed with fear.

Gaurab Rajbhandari was inside the unstable family home that had been caught in Nepal's magnitude-7.8 earthquake Saturday. "I was worried about his safety. I was very traumatized," said the 29-year-old Rajbhandari Monday afternoon at University Hall.

As the death toll in Nepal climbed past 4,000, there were shortages of food, fuel, electricity and shelter buildings in parts of the capital of Katmandu. Conditions were far worse in the countryside, with rescue workers still struggling to reach mountain villages two days after the earthquake.

Rajbhandari has not been home in four years. During that time, he has earned a master's degree in computer science at UAlbany and has moved forward into his doctoral studies.

Rajbhandari is one of four Nepalese students attending UAlbany.

He's eager to return to Nepal on a long-planned visit this summer. "I have to go there to support my family," he said.

While Rajbhandari was relieved that his father, mother, young sister and extended family in Patan were safe, they are living in a garage.

"It's scary," he said thinking about the shattered buildings and people being forced to move outside without tents and other supplies.

He's still concerned that he hasn't been able to speak directly to his mother and sister.

When he first learned of the earthquake, he couldn't reach his parents. His 27-year-old brother, Paurakh Rajbhandari, a student at Stanford University, was able to call them. Baibhav Rajbhandari listened in on Skype while his brother talked to his father on the phone.

Rajbhandari is now turning his attention to helping provide relief to the survivors of the earthquake in the country of 27 million.

"They need equipment. They need medical equipment," he emphasized.
