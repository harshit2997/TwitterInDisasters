A charity worker from Wales is flying to Nepal to help victims of the country’s worst earthquake for 80 years.

Jamie Richardson, of Welshpool, works full-time for the Catholic Relief Services organisation as a technical advisor on shelters.

He is making the 9,200-mile round trip to join the massive international relief effort after more than 1,000 people in four countries died as a result of the 7.8 magnitude quake, which struck 50 miles north-west of the Nepalese capital Kathmandu.

Mr Richardson said: “I’m going to work with other team members as part of the humanitarian response.

“It’s always a bit sketchy but the indications are it’s fairly serious.

“People can die of exposure and I hope to help because I am a technical advisor for CRS on shelters.”

Mr Richardson says he plans to be in the mountainous country for three or four weeks.

The majority of deaths were reported in Nepal, with fatalities also confirmed in India, Tibet and Bangladesh, and on the Nepal-China border.

The earthquake struck just before midday, sending tremors through the Kathmandu Valley and the city of Pokhara.

Tanya Barron, chief executive officer of Plan International UK, who is in eastern Nepal on a scheduled visit, said she was on the top floor of a building when it started to “shake violently”.

She added: “It was very scary.”

The Foreign Office said embassy staff stand ready to help any British nationals who may need assistance.

An aftershock of magnitude 6.6 hit about an hour after the initial quake, and smaller aftershocks could be felt through the region for hours.

Senior mountaineering guide Ang Tshering said an avalanche swept the face of Mount Everest after the earthquake, killing 10 people and injuring at least 30.
