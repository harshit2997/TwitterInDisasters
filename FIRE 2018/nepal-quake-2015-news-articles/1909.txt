CNN PRODUCER NOTE UPDATE 04/28/15 Ahmed emailed us with the news that Raisaa and her two travel companions are safe and well. After hiking for six hours from their resort to Kathmandu, they were able to borrow a phone to call the Bangladeshi embassy and Unilever, where Raisaa works, to let all know they were safe, he says. "It was fantastic to hear her voice, what was surprising is that her voice sounded very strong, it didn't seem like she had gone through a terrible episode in her life," he says. "The journey from the resort was bad, roads blocked and so they had to walk as there was a landslide about 30km from resort. She said it was the saddest walk of her life, with countless villages flattened."

They are currently being taken to Kathmandu airport to fly home to Bangladesh, he adds. "Thank you CNN so much for providing an avenue to get this news out," he says. "We reached a lot of response ... that brought forth the information that they were alive and not hurt from the earthquake. This information was extremely important to us psychologically."

04/27/15 Massachusetts resident ashadmann1 is searching for his sister, Raisaa, originally from Bangladesh, who had traveled to The Last Resort in Tatopani, Nepal, to take part in the various outdoor activities they offer. His mother last spoke to her the morning of Saturday, a few hours before the earthquake hit. "Immediately after the earthquake we tried contacting them but could not get through," he said. "It has been roughly 72 hours and we still have had no direct contact with them."
