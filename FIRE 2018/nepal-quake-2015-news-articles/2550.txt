Bhutanese prayer service will focus on Nepal

MARK HAYWARD

New Hampshire Union Leader

Earthquake-ravaged Nepal will be on the minds of Bhutanese Wednesday evening, when they gather in Hooksett for a Hindu prayer service, a leader of the New Hampshire Bhutanese said.Four or five Hindu priests are expected to lead the prayers, said Tikam Acharya, executive director of the Bhutanese Community of New Hampshire. Participants will also be encouraged to donate to a relief effort that the community has launched.“Anybody is welcome,” Acharya said. “Our Hindu religion is wide open. It doesn’t restrict any other religion.”The prayer session is scheduled to begin around 6 p.m. Wednesday at 11 Kimball Drive, Hooksett.Today marks the third day since an earthquake tore through sections of the Himalayan country of Nepal, a country with close ties to the 4,000 Bhutanese who call New Hampshire home.Most Bhutanese in New Hampshire trace their family roots to Nepal, Acharya said.At one point, they immigrated to Bhutan, but in the early 1990s, the Buddhist-majority Bhutan forced ethnic Nepalis out of the country. They returned to their native Nepal and lived in refugee camps.Like many of the Bhutanese who now live in New Hampshire, Manchester resident Tilak Niroula lived in a refugee camp in Nepal for two decades. He said it has been difficult to get information from Nepal since the earthquake.“We are not able to connect with everyone in Nepal,” Niroula said. “It’s very hard to figure out who died.”The earthquake took out internet connection, and many people aren’t going into their homes for fear of aftershocks.“The situation over there is really, really bad,” Niroula said.Acharya said the refugee camp, which still has about 20,000 residents, has experienced some tremors, but no casualties that he knows of.Niroula produces a half-hour weekly show about Bhutanese immigrants for Concord community access television. He said Facebook and YouTube videos from the show are seen in 60 countries. He plans to devote much of the upcoming show to the earthquake.The Bhutanese Community of New Hampshire has started to ask for relief donations, which they will funnel through the Red Cross in Nepal, Acharya said.Large waves of Bhutanese started coming to New Hampshire in early 2008. That flow has now slowed, and most Bhutanese who arrived this year will be able to reunify with family members, he said. Initially, Bhutanese took menial jobs such as dishwashers, but they now work in health care, manufacturing and farming, he said.He estimates that 250 have become American citizens.mhayward@unionleader.com
