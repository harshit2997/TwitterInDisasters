UNICEF Hungary: Earthquake In Nepal: 1 Million Children In Danger
</headline>

<text>
The earthquake has collapsed buildings, flattened homes and destroyed roads and infrastructure, leaving recovery efforts to sift through large amounts of rubble and debris in search for survivors. Hospitals are overcrowded, quickly depleting emergency supplies and leaving no room to store the dead bodies.

26 UNICEF staff is already in the field providing immediate help. The UNICEF Regional Office – also located in Kathmandu – is already providing technical support to UNICEF’s local country staff.

UNICEF has started receiving requests for assistance for essential drugs, medical and surgical equipment (trauma kits), and tents for emergency hospitals. UNICEF has opened its pre-positioned supplies in Kathmandu to cover immediate needs such as water purification tablets, hygiene kits, tarpaulins and nutrition supplies and an additional 120 tons of supplies have been airlifted on Sunday.

We need to act now and act fast to reach and protect these vulnerable children in the aftermath of the earthquake. Yet, we cannot do this work alone.

With your generous partnership, UNICEF will continue working relentlessly – and as quickly as possible – to protect the health, safety and well-being of the most vulnerable children and families devastated by the earthquake by delivering the critical, life-saving supplies to where it is needed most.

2000 Ft - provides 200 water purification tablets, which serves 200 children with clear water for a day.

3000 Ft - buys two blankets for those who lost their homes and spend the night in tents.

6000 Ft - gives hygiene packs sufficient for a month for two families.



Thank you for your support to save lives!
