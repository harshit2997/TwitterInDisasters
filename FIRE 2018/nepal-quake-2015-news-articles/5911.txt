SEATTLE, Wash.---A private expedition team from Seattle is set to travel to Nepal Friday to search for two Washington girls with ties to the Tri-Cities who were on a trek in the country when Saturday's earthquake hit.



Bailey Meola and her friend Sydney Schumacher, both 19-years-old, were on their way back from Nepal's popular Langtang Valley Trail. They were on their way back when the massive earthquake struck, triggering a huge avalanche that buried entire villages, including Langtang.



Schumacher's older brother, Paul Schumacher, took the same journey three years ago. Now, all he can do is guess where is little sister might be. "We think they are somewhere in between The Lamma Hotel and Kyanjin Gompa," said Schumacher.



Bailey Meola's mother graduated from Richland High School. She last spoke to her daughter over a week ago. A fundraising website to help search for the girls has now raised over $32,000. The expedition team departs at 6:30 p.m.
