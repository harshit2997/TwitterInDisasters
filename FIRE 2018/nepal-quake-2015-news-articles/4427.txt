They are expected to be taken to Kathmandu from Nuwakot where they will will meet up with the Gift of the Givers team relief team.

The four, Irma Fourie, Heinz Hochrinner, Mike Sherman, and Kate Ahrens were due to be airlifted from the nature reserve before word came that they and other tourists had managed to leave Langtang by themselves.
