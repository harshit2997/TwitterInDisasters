THE Bendigo community prayed for victims of last week's earthquake in Nepal during a vigil on Thursday.

More than 50 people turned out to the Bendigo War Memorial, lighting candles as a symbol of hope.

Umesh Shrestha said the earthquake had caused devastation among Bendigo's Nepalese community.

He said more than $1600 had been raised, with the money set to go towards rebuilding at least one school.

"It's overwhelming. Everybody wants to contribute, everybody wants to help," Mr Shrestha said.

"People are very generous."

Mr Shrestha said one member of Bendigo's Nepalese community found out their uncle had died.

Among the group was City of Greater Bendigo Mayor Peter Cox, who encouraged the community to consider donating funds to help ensure the national recovers from the disaster.

"The earthquake has had a devastating impact on Nepal with the death toll now exceeding 4800 and there are 10,000 people injured, and many thousands are without a home," Mr Cox said.

"Major disasters such as this require an enormous amount of international support to provide relief and longer-term recovery efforts."
