Many streetchildren living in the national capital on Thursday took to the streets to collect aid for victims of the Nepal earthquake.

Associated with Badhte Kadam, a federation of street and working children, the youngsters knocked on the doors of many commercial establishments in Lajpat Nagar and Sarojini Nagar in south Delhi to collect donations.

"Many children become victims of trafficking whenever such calamities occur. We hope citizens of Delhi will contribute wholeheartedly," said Sanjay Gupta, director of NGO Chetna.

According to Badhte Kadam, the children collected Rs.5,000 in the first day and the drive will continue till the target of Rs.10,000 is not achieved. The donations will then be sent to the Prime Minister's Relief Fund.

The organisation had collected Rs.50,000 and Rs.20,000 for the victims of flash floods in Jammu and Kashmir and Uttarakhand, respectively.

Nepal was devastated by a major earthquake on April 25, measuring 7.9 on the Richter scale that has so far left over 5,700 people dead.
