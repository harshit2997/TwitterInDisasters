They Survived on Biscuits for 3 Days

BENGALURU:Four people from the state who were stranded in earthquake-ravaged Nepal were brought to Delhi and left for home on Wednesday morning.

Rangaswamy, joint resident commissioner, Kannada Bhavan in New Delhi, said the final list of people from the state who are still in Nepal is yet to be drawn up.

V Nagaraj, a retired SBI official and resident of Vidyaranyapura, recalled his horrifying experience.

The family of four had left to Nepal on April 20 to visit the Mukthinath temple. After their darshan at the temple, they were returning from Pokhara, 80 km from Katmandu, when they witnessed a row of houses collapsing. The family stopped their taxi and approached the dilapidated structures, only to find everything submerged in debris.

“We realised that it was an earthquake and were walking back to the cab when we felt the tremors again. All along our journey we saw devastation. This country will take at least ten years to return to normal,” Nagaraj said.

He also added that the Indian Air Force was one of the first to begin rescue operations by airlifting victims.

His wife Jyothi said, “We had to survive on biscuits for three days.”

Meanwhile, a team of 20 doctors have been chosen to work in Nepal’s Chirayu Hospital.

Vascular surgeon Dr R Muralidhar said three doctors had already left with relief material and 17 more doctors will reach Kathmandu by Thursday evening.

The State Government Doctors Association also said all members of the association would give one days’ salary to help Nepal.

Survivor Recalls Nightmare

Hubballi: “It is sheer luck that I survived,” said Anand Singh Mokashi who made it safely back home on Monday.

Anand, a distributor of a US-based medical equipment company at Vernekar Plaza in Deshpande Nagar, had gone to Kathmandu with his wife Madhavi, colleague Sudhindra Wagal and Wagal’s wife Roopali to attend the annual meet of the company.

He said: “We checked in to Hotel Radisson. I went to attend the conference leaving my wife in the hotel. At 11.20 am the earthquake jolted the entire building. It took us a few seconds to realise what was happening.” Some people ran out of the auditorium and some lay down on the floor. Luckily around 80 members at the conference managed to escape, he said.
