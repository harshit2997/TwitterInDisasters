Canberra, Apr 27 (IBNS) As Nepal was hit by a massive 7.9 earthquake on Saturday, followed by several aftershocks, more than 300 Australians are currently missing in the country, media reports said on Monday.

"They headed to the region to volunteer, trek in the Himalayas and to take in historic monuments and temples. Now more than 300 Australians are missing in Nepal after the earthquake on Saturday killed thousands of people and left many more injured," The Sydney Morning Herald reported.

Australia's Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade has said that 549 Australians were registered as travelling in Nepal.

The Australian Embassy in Nepal is providing assistance to Australians and has confirmed the safety of over 200.

"There are 549 Australians registered as travelling in Nepal and officials are working under challenging conditions to locate all those in the country. While there are reports of extensive loss of life, at this point there are no reports of Australian deaths," the Department said in a statement.
