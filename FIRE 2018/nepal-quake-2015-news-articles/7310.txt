NH residents find a way to help Nepalese

- With the safe return of Celia and Rick Wilcox, relief efforts for Nepal with a decidedly strong connection to the Mount Washington Valley were well underway Tuesday.During the 7.8 magnitude earthquake on April 25 that killed approximately 8,000 people and leveled many buildings in the land-locked nation at the top of the world, Wilcoxes, who are mountain guides and co-owners of International Mountain Equipment, were in the midst of leading three clients, accompanied by 10 native guides and porters, on a 22-day trek through the Himalaya Mountains. The trek was originally intended to include a stop at the Mount Everest Base Camp.The side trip to the base camp - where 18 people died in avalanches triggered by the earthquake - was abandoned, but the trekkers nonetheless continued on their preplanned route, reaching Kathmandu without incident. From there, they flew back to the U.S., right on schedule for their May 8 return.On Tuesday, the Wilcoxes were back at the IME offices, fielding calls from concerned friends, colleagues and contractors. In between the calls and drop-in visitors, they devised a plan to help the Nepal community of Khumjung, home to the Sherpa guides they've worked for some 30 years.At the same time, Tsering Sherpa, a Nepal native and resident of North Conway, and Candy Chaplin of Bartlett, president of the Nepal Children's Health and Education Foundation (NCHEF), launched a relief effort of their own.While Sherpa focused on her hometown of Namche Bazaar, where a school and a dentist's office were destroyed in the original earthquake, Chaplin was concentrating on the villages of Bung and Chheskam, where a school was also damaged. In March, Chaplin led 16 students and two parent doctors from the Derryfield School to the towns where they volunteered at a regional health clinic.Celia Wilcox thanked everyone who kept her and Rick in their prayers, noting that 'those prayers were answered ahead of time,' because thanks to careful planning, the IME trekkers were entirely self-reliant, and, when the April 25th earthquake hit, they found themselves in a wide valley that effectively shielded them from both avalanches and rock slides.She corrected early media reports that the IME group lost its possessions when the Hotel Thamel in Kathmandu collapsed - the hotel turned out to be fine - and that the international airport at Kathmandu was shut down because it was damaged and clogged with international aid that wasn't getting to its ultimate destination.Sherpa, whose father, Tsedam, is a close friend of the Wilcoxes and operates a mountaineering store in Nepal, said she and a fellow Fryeburg Academy graduate are hoping to get manufacturers and retailers to donate tents, which would be sent to her homeland.Rick and Celia Wilcox, for their part, are in the early stages of launching a nonprofit to channel monetary donations directly to community leaders in Nepal for rebuilding projects in Khumjung and perhaps Namche Bazaar, too.Tax-deductible donations may be made right now, however, to the NCHEF, where the money would be used to pay for the repair or construction of schools, and for covering the tuition of the three children of a porter who was killed on April 25.Chaplin said she expects to spend a lot of time on the phone to determine what damage was caused by the aftershock.The Wilcoxes added that in addition to supporting one of the several ongoing Nepal relief efforts, the many people who’ve trekked there in recent years should reach out to any local contacts they’ve made and help the country’s recovery by person-to-person assistance.Another way to help, said Celia, would be for people to go on another trek “and leave lots of cash.” jkoziol@newstote.com
