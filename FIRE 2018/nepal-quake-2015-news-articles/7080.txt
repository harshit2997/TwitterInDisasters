A group of Coventry pupils have donated their pocket money to help earthquake victims in Nepal .

Students at Ash Green School decided that they wanted to do everything they could to help in the wake of the natural disaster due to the special interest they have with Nepal.

One of the school’s four colleges, Delta College, has been twinned with a Nepalese village for the past two years, thanks to Nuneaton Rotary member, Gary Dancer.

Ash Green Sixth form students, Scarlett Robertson and Joseph Forsyth, were involved in making a film about the comparison between the two cultures so that students in Nepal could understand life in Britain today.

A £100 cheque for the first phase of fundraising was presented to Sue Kershaw, of Nuneaton Rotary, in an assembly held by Delta College.

Sue, who has visited the village in Nepal and was involved in the making of the film, was both delighted and emotional to receive the donation from the students, who had pulled together to help make a difference.

Each class in Delta College will also be fundraising in the forthcoming weeks to further boost the appeal.
