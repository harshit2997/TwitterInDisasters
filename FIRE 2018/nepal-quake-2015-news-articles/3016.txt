Death Toll From Nepal Quake Over 4,300
</headline>

<text>
The death toll from the earthquake in Nepal has climbed above 4,300.

Authorities on April 28 said that 8,000 people had been injured.

International aid has finally begun arriving in the Himalayan nation of 28 million people after the major quake that struck at about midday on April 25.

In Kathmandu, as elsewhere, thousands are sleeping on pavements, roads, and in parks, many under makeshift tents.

Hospitals are full to overflowing, while water, food and power are scarce, raising fears of waterborne diseases.

India and China were among the first contributors to an international effort to support Nepal's stretched resources.

On April 27, the United States announced an additional $9 million in aid for Nepal, bringing total U.S. disaster funding to $10 million.

U.S. Defense Secretary Ashton Carter said two C-17 U.S. Air Force transport planes carrying search-and-rescue personnel and supplies were headed to Nepal.
