A baby girl has been born to a young Nepalese couple in one of the field hospitals set up following last weekend's earthquake.

Both the mother and the baby, who has not been named yet, are doing well.

Lata Chand, 19, was heavily pregnant when the 7.8-magnitude earthquake struck last Saturday. She and her husband ran out of their house in panic. Their home was undamaged, but the hospital where she was to give birth was forced to close.

They went to a field hospital set up by the Israeli military instead, where the baby was born.

The beaming midwife, Dganit Gery, said she hoped the birth would show all Nepalese women that there is hope for the future.

Lata's husband Hariender Chand said they were terrified the quake would cause her to miscarry.

"When the quake struck I was thinking 'will we survive?' because most of the pregnant women miscarried their babies. I was scared it would happen to us. Now we're safe, it's good."
