Under-Secretary-General and Emergency Relief Coordinator Valerie Amos: Statement on the earthquake in Nepal
</headline>

<text>
(London/New York, 26 April 2015) Our thoughts are with the people of Nepal as they deal with the loss of life and devastation caused by Saturdayâ€™s earthquake and aftershocks.

The information is still incomplete but the estimated number killed has now risen to more than 2,200 people, and more than 5,800 people are believed to have been injured. Sadly, it is likely that these figures will rise as humanitarian workers reach the more remote areas near the epicentre of the earthquake.

Homes and buildings have collapsed and entire areas have been flattened. People need food, water, emergency shelter and healthcare. Many families have slept in the open in makeshift tents for two nights.

Time is of the essence for the search and rescue operations. The actions of the Government of Nepal and local communities themselves have already saved many lives. Teams from India, Pakistan, China and Israel have started work, and more are on their way from the US, the UK, Singapore, the United Arab Emirates, the European Union and elsewhere.

The United Nations agencies in Nepal, with their humanitarian partners, are supporting the Government and other partners. A team from the World Food Programme is on the ground providing food items and trucks for distribution, UNICEF is sending tents and healthcare supplies, and the World Health Organization has distributed medical supplies to cover the immediate needs of 40,000 people. A United Nations Disaster Assessment and Coordination team is on the ground helping to coordinate response efforts.

The United Nations will continue to support the people of Nepal in the weeks and months ahead.
