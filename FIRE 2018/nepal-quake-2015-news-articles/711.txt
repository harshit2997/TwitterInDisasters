Nepal earthquake: Canberra grandmother, grandson safe at Australian embassy in Kathmandu, family says

Updated

A Canberra man and his grandmother working at an orphanage in Nepal are safe at the Australian embassy in Kathmandu after the massive earthquake that hit the region.

Hamish McKee, 21, from Holder and Riitta Korpinen, 66, from Carwoola just outside Canberra have spent the past four weeks working at an orphanage in the town of Biratnager in the south of the country.

They were among dozens of Australians reported missing after the magnitude-7.9 quake struck that has killed more than 1,900 people, but a family member made contact with them on Sunday afternoon.

They said there were a number of other Australians at the embassy and that tents and food were being brought in.

Kiki Korpinen said her mother, Riita, had gone to Nepal on a number of occasions to work at the SLC Academy.

"My mother helped set up a school there, she is a teacher here in Australia, a retired teacher now, so she has been training the teachers there," she said.

"She has been going to Nepal over the years wrote a few times and this time my son Hamish had the opportunity to go with her to work in an orphanage."
