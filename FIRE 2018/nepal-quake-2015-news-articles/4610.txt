Nepal earthquake: one father’s agonising choice

When his chair began to shudder, Bijay knew what was happening.

The father-of-two was at home in Kathmandu with his family when the earthquake struck.

“Suddenly, the house started shaking, I could feel it swaying – I knew what was happening,” he said. “I grabbed my kids and dragged them to the door. I could hear my wife in the other room crying and praying.”

Bijay Dahal is a Nepalese Red Cross worker. Thanks to his training, he knew his family had to escape the house and find open ground as soon as the shaking subsided.

But 20 years’ experience could not prepare him for the heart-rending decision he had to make as he was fleeing.

I had to make a choice

“As I was running down the stairs with my boys, my elderly parents were clinging to each other in the bedroom,” he said. “My dad is 79 and paralysed – my mum would not leave his side.

“In that moment, I had to make a choice – to get my kids to safety or to stay with my parents with no guarantee that the house would withstand the earthquake. My mum told me to go.”

Bijay’s eldest son, who is 15 and has Down’s syndrome, was begging his dad to save his grandparents. But the disaster expert knew he couldn’t do both.

“I am normally my son’s protector, his friend. But in that moment, I had to shout and drag him out – I could see the confusion in his face. That was very painful,” Bijay said.

An agonising wait

The family were joined outside by crowds of bewildered neighbours. Bijay had to wait 30 agonising minutes before he knew his parents were safe.

“I wore my motorbike helmet to re-enter the house to check on them after the shaking stopped. It was amazing to find them both okay.”

Dahal, his wife and sons were forced to sleep outside in the driving rain as powerful aftershocks continued to crumble buildings around the neighbourhood.

“A seven-storey guest house collapsed in my neighbourhood and I know there are still bodies buried under the rubble,” he said.

Bijay is now back to work, at the heart of the Nepal Red Cross’ relief effort. Staff and volunteers are working in Kathmandu as well as difficult-to-reach areas across the country.

He said the priority for the moment was immediate aid.

“Food, water and shelter for the many families who continue to live outside are our priority right now, and we will be striving to reach those communities that desperately need our help,” he said.
