Vodafone also offering aid while Three said it is “assessing how it can best help” earthquake victims



O2 and Vodafone have been offering customers with friends or family in Nepal free calls to mobiles or landlines in the country that was hit by a devastating earthquake last weekend.

Customers who have made calls to Nepal since the disaster, which occurred on Saturday and has claimed the lives of more than 3,000, will have costs of the calls returned.

Calls to the country will be free between April 29 and May 5, while O2 customers in the Himalayan country will be credited for all calls made from Nepal.

In a blog on O2’s website, it has also encouraged people to denote £5 to the Disasters Emergency Committee appeal by texting the word “Nepal” to 7,000. It said it will pass on 100 per cent of the donation, with no charge for the text.

Vodafone announced yesterday that it is sending equipment to Nepal to aid in the rescue effort. According to the BBC, Saturday’s 7.8 magnitude quake has killed more than 5,000 people, with 11,000 more injured.

Three said it was currently assessing how it can best help people stuck in the country, which has been left devastated by the disaster.

EE said it has launched an appeal on behalf of UNICEF to provide customers with an easy way of donating to the earthquake appeal. However, it did not say whether it was charging customers for calling Nepal.

US operators AT&T, Sprint, Verizon and T-Mobile have all offered free calls and texts to the country as the relief effort continues.
