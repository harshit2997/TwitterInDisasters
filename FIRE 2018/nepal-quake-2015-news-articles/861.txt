KUALA LUMPUR: Asean Foreign Ministers have pledged assistance to the countries affected by the devastating earthquake in Nepal, which has claimed more than 2,200 lives.

Foreign Affairs Minister Datuk Seri Anifah Aman (pic) said the foreign ministers were ready to join international efforts in assisting the people of Nepal, Bangladesh, and India.

“We wish to convey our deepest condolences to the Governments and peoples of Nepal, India and Bangladesh, as well as to the families affected by the earthquake.

“We are saddened by the loss of lives and damages to properties and infrastructures, as well as historical heritage sites in the capital of Kathmandu and surrounding areas,” he told reporters after chairing the Asean foreign ministers meeting here on the sideline of the Asean 26th Summit, here on Sunday.

Anifah said the Malaysian embassy in Nepal was doing all it could to establish contact with Malaysians in the area who had yet to report their whereabouts.

He said two Malaysian women, believed to be sisters, were still ‘unaccounted for’ as the embassy had not heard from them yet.

“We are not saying something happened to them, it’s just that they have yet to report to the mission there.

“That is why we would like to advise anyone who travels overseas to please report your whereabouts to the mission in that country so that in the event of unforeseen circumstances such as this, we know where to look for you,” said Anifah.
