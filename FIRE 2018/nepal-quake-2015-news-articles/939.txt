Bharath: Govt considers help for Nepal

By JULIEN NEAVES Sunday, April 26 2015

GOVERNMENT has expressed condolences to the government and people of Nepal and will be looking at possible assistance following a devastating earthquake which has left more than 1,000 people dead and many more trapped.

“The Government of Trinidad and Tobago extends sincerest sympathies and condolences first of all to the government and to all those families who would have lost loved ones,” said Communications Minister Vasant Bharath.



Yesterday a magnitude 7.8 earthquake, the worst to hit the country in 80 years, struck an area of central Nepal between the capital, Kathmandu, and the city of Pokhara. According to reports the death toll had reached 1,150 by yesterday afternoon and many people were trapped under rubble.



The quake also caused deaths in India, Bangladesh, Tibet and on Mount Everest, where it triggered avalanches. The government has declared a state of emergency in the affected areas and offers of help have come in from countries around the world.



Yesterday Bharath, speaking with Sunday Newsday in a telephone interview, described the destruction from the quake as “significant”. He said the Government always considers the humanitarian perspective when countries get into these type of difficulties. He recalled that Trinidad and Tobago assisted New Orleans following Hurricane Katrina and also Caricom partners. In January last year this country sent technical assistance and supplies to St Vincent and St Lucia following devastating floods the previous Christmas Eve.



“Once there is a major requirement for human need the Government always do that when they can, whether human or financial assistance,” he said.



Bharath noted that the Nepal disaster will be assessed and will go to Cabinet. He expressed hope that the rubble will be cleared up soon and normalcy of life is restored. According to the United States aid agency USAid the US is sending a disaster response team to Nepal and has released an initial US$1m to address immediate needs.
