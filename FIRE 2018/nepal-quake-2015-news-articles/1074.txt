Nepal earthquake: MFA crisis response team in Nepal, no reports of injured Singaporeans so far
</headline>

<text>
SINGAPORE - The Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MFA) has despatched a Crisis Response Team (CRT) to Kathmandu to provide consular assistance to Singaporeans, after a 7.8 magnitude earthquake struck Nepal on Saturday.

In a statement on Sunday, the Ministry said it has not received any reports of Singaporeans who have been injured thus far.

The MFA has contacted the majority of the registered Singaporeans in Nepal, but there remain some Singaporeans who remain uncontactable - probably due to the disruption of the local communication network. The ministry said it is doing its best to contact them.

The MFA team took the first available SilkAir flight to Nepal on Sunday morning, and has since arrived in Nepal. They are based at the Kathmandu International Airport to assist Singaporeans who wish to leave the country.

The MFA is coordinating with the Ministry of Defence to arrange for Singaporeans to depart via RSAF aircraft, which are scheduled to arrive in Kathmandu on Monday.

The RSAF C130 aircraft carried the Home Team and SAF contingents supporting search and rescue and other disaster relief efforts in Nepal.

Singapore does not have an embassy in Kathmandu. Singaporeans in Nepal can contact the 24-hour MFA Duty Officer at 63798800, 63798855 or mfa_duty_officer@mfa.gov.sg for any assistance or advice.
