The Kerala government said on Wednesday that it will contribute Rs.2 crore to quake-hit Nepal.

Chief Minister Oommen Chandy said each minister would set aside Rs.10,000 from his or her salary.

He said he had sent Minister for Diaspora K.C. Joseph to New Delhi to oversee the repatriation of Keralites from Nepal.

"The bodies of two Kerala doctors who were found dead in Nepal will reach Kerala either today (Wednesday) or tomorrow (Thursday)," said Chandy.
