RAF Odiham crews to head to Nepal

CHINOOK crews from RAF Odiham are preparing to help with rescue efforts in earthquake-stricken Nepal.

The Government announced that three CH47 Chinook helicopters will be transported to the country via RAF Brize Norton in Oxfordshire.

The first is expected to be flown to Nepal today, with the two others set to follow in the coming days.

More than 6,000 people have been killed by the worst earthquake to hit the country in 80 years, while more than 13,000 have been injured.

Hopes were raised yesterday for more survivors after two people were pulled from the rubble five days after the earthquake.

The UK Government is also providing £2.5million to the UN's Humanitarian Air Service, which will increase helicopter capacity, enabling aid supplies to be taken to more isolated areas.

It has also pledged £15million, while more than £19million has been raised by the public.

Development Secretary Justine Greening said: "These highly versatile Royal Air Force helicopters and UN aircraft will mean life-saving aid supplies can be moved around Nepal and reach people in remote communities cut off by the earthquake who are in desperate need.

"Conditions in Nepal are dire, but the UK is determined to do everything it can to help support Nepal and its people."

It is not the first time that Chinooks from RAF Odiham have been sent to disaster zones to help with relief efforts.

Crews and aircraft from the north Hampshire base were sent to Pakistan in 2005, to assist in the relief effort after an earthquake left more than 75,000 people dead.
