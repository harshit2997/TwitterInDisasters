NEPAL (CBS) - Desperate residents in earthquake ravaged Nepal are still awaiting aid following last week's magnitude 7.8 earthquake.

Hundreds of thousands of people are still living in the open without clean water right now.

Amid the devastation, French rescuers managed to pull a survivor from the ruins of a three-story hotel in Kathmandu.

Nepal's prime minister says the death toll in the country could reach 10,000.

The survivor's stories are pouring in as rescuers continue to pull many from the rubble.

Reporter Brian Webb spoke to one California family who is breathing a sigh of relief after finding out their loved one is safe.

Spencer Dickinson's mother burst into tears after hearing her son is alive and ok.

The 21-year-old from California went to Nepal as part of a spiritual journey and last spoke to his family by Skype April 19.

The next day he set out for Mount Everest.

They waited nearly four long days since the quake without knowing where he was.

"When that avalanche happened and the earthquake happened and with Spencer alone on the trail, could something have happened and you don't know and that's the scariest part for me," said Linda Rosenbush, Spencer's mother.

The massive 7.9 earthquake hit Saturday. The death toll now tops 5,000 people.

American Kirk Hanson shot the last few seconds of the quake on his phone. In the video, you can see a man being shaken by the earth below.

Kirk and Mike Roten had been in earthquakes in California before, but nothing like this.

"We got a call later from a guy at the hotel we had checked out of a few hours earlier. The words he used were 'it was gone,'" said Mike Roten.

There are more incredible survival stories like Rishi Khanal, pulled from a collapsed hotel by a French rescue team that heard him banging on the rubble.

He had been buried for 82 hours.

Doctors believe he has a broken leg.

Back in California, survivor Spencer Dickinsin's family says he will be heading to America soon.

Dramatic photos and video is coming out of Nepal showing rescue efforts after the earthquake.

One of the most powerful images shows the Nepal army rescuing a 4-month-old baby from the rubble 22 hours later.

The baby was discovered after someone heard him cry.

Thankfully, he has no major injuries.

Rescue crews and residents are still desperately searching for survivors.

Whole streets and squares in the capital of Kathmandu are reduced to rubble.
