Volunteers have set up an emergency collection for Oxfam’s Nepal Earthquake Appeal outside Chester Railway Station between 4:30pm and 7:30pm tonight and tomorrow (Tuesday, May 12 and Wednesday, May 13).

The country was struck by a second earthquake earlier today whilst still attempting to recover from the awful affects of the first one on April 24.

The collection has been organised by Chester residents Sarah O’Hanlan and Vicky Shearn. Vicky is currently working in India.

The money they are hoping to raise will go towards helping Oxfam to provide hygiene kits, clean water, toilets and emergency shelter.

Sarah said: “I feel that everyone has been really struck by what has happened and want to support in any way they can. I went to a fantastic fundraiser at Alexander’s last night and a lot of people were giving a lot of support.”

Vicky added: “As soon as I saw in the papers I knew I wanted to help, despite being in India, so I posted on our facebook group, Oxfam Chester, suggesting a collection and thankfully Sarah wanted to help organise it. I can’t imagine the devastation, but I am currently working on a hygiene, sanitation and water project with Raleigh International and I know how important it is that the people in Nepal get access to these things as soon as possible.

If you’re not going though Chester Railway Station at those times you can donate to Oxfam online at donate.oxfam.org.uk/emergency/nepal.
