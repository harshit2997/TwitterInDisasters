Twenty five students and four teachers from St Margaret's College are in the country as part of the World Challenge programme, which runs expeditions for students.

The school's principal, Gillian Simpson, said it was now a case of getting them out.

"Everybody is doing what they can to look at the way to get them out as soon as possible.

"We will get updates - it's just having that patience. We've just got to wait now."

Ms Simpson said all the students were in good spirits.

MFAT has 'no specific concerns'

The Ministry of Foreign Affairs said more than 180 New Zealanders have now been confirmed safe in Nepal.

It said it had no specific concerns about New Zealanders in Nepal but admitted it may take time to account for all of them.

It said if anyone was worried about relatives in Nepal, they should contact the Ministry.
