WILMINGTON, Del. â€” Civilian and government relief groups, including two launched from Dover Air Force Base, have begun arriving in Nepal in large numbers as part of an international effort to save victims of Saturday's massive earthquake that as of Monday evening had claimed more than 4,000 lives.

Dagsboro residents Amy Kaufman and her daughter Holly hope to join the effort.

The two were in Rishikesh, India, trying to make their way to Nepal on a non-emergency charity mission for their non-profit group, the Shauna Rose Kaufman Foundation, when the 7.8-magnitude earthquake hit. The foundation has been performing charity work there for five years.

The two now are trying to join the relief effort, which includes doctors, volunteers and equipment pouring into Nepal following the reopening of Tribhuvan International Airport in Kathmandu. Some aid vehicles were also able to travel overland from India to the stricken Nepalese city of Pokhara, according to reports.

Secretary of State John Kerry announced Monday that the U.S. will send an additional $9 million in aid to Nepal, bringing the total so far to $10 million.

The Kaufmans have been emailing with a friend in Nepal who has been describing the devastation.

"I am now leaving for volunteering work in a rescue team" to remove dead bodies from demolished houses in Sankhu/eastern part of Kathmandu," Ram Krishna, one of the foundation's board members, wrote to the Kaufmans on Sunday.

"Please, Please, Please do pray for the peace souls of the death people," he said.

Relief groups, which began arriving in Nepal Sunday, say there is still time to save lives.

The foundation was started after Amy Kaufman's other daughter, Shauna, died six years ago in a car accident near Georgetown, Md. The foundation's work has involved art projects in Shauna's name and a trip to Nepal to teach English.

"We are coordinating a plan now as to how we can best help in Nepal," Kaufman said in an email. "If donations are sent through our 501(c)(3) now, we can access as Indian rupees, which I believe will be more valuable and are readily accepted in Nepal.

"We will be updating on our website, a designated Nepal Relief Fund, for direct donations."

She said 100% will be used for relief.

Dover relief

Two Air Force cargo jets carrying three emergency response teams, two of whom boarded a jet in Dover, were expected to land in Nepal Monday evening Eastern Time.

The relief flights are part of an international effort to search for survivors and provide aid as a second American victim was identified as one of 18 who died on Mount Everest in a massive avalanche triggered by the earthquake.

Additional Pentagon support will pivot on an assessment conducted by an arriving U.S. State Department response team, Marine Corps Lt. Col. Jeffrey Pool, a Pentagon spokesman, said Monday.

The C-17 aircraft that launched from Dover is transporting nearly 70 people, including a U.S. Agency for International Development Disaster Assistance Response Team, the Fairfax County Urban Search and Rescue team and several journalists, along with 45 square tons of cargo, Pentagon spokesman Army Col. Steve Warren said in a statement issued Sunday.

That jet is not assigned to the Dover fleet and originated at Joint Base Maguire-Dix-Lakehurst, N.J., officials said.

Another C-17, taking off from Joint Base Charleston, S.C., picked up about 50 members of an urban search-and-rescue team from Los Angeles at March Air Force Base, Calif., according to Pool.

The two jets, which began their journeys Sunday, are bound for Tribhuvan, Warren said.

In addition to the rescue personnel, the C-17 that took off from Dover also was carrying six K-9 dogs to assist Nepal with rescue operations, said Airman 1st Class William Johnson, a Dover spokesman.

'People are very scared'

The Kaufmans shared two emails from board member Ram Krishna. In his Sunday email, Krishna described the devastation:

"Hope this email finds you all well. Yesterday's earthquake was very disastrous, thousands of people have died and numbers will rise as many villages have been cut up with communication and electricity. We don't have electricity since yesterday morning. We all spent the whole night in a small open place experiencing more than 68 shocks after the 1st shocked at 11:56 am. It's really really scary, can't think what to do. We had again big shock this morning around 5 am.

"According to the news, many villages have been disconnected with the communication. Most of the old monuments have been demolished, it affects very badly in the economy of Nepal.

"We all are still safe and people are very scared as shocks go on and on.

"This is all for now and will update you again this evening."

The following day Krishna wrote how he felt odd taking pictures while distributing food:

"I am so sorry that I couldn't update you last evening as we didn't have electricity and I was very tired after returning from rescuing work. When I went to Sankhu/eastern part of Kathmandu, it was chaos and ruin the very nice small town. It made me cry. I can't explain it by words what I had seen there. I went there this morning again and volunteering digging the demolished houses and able to take out three death bodies. There are still hundreds of death body, under the demolished houses.

"Yesterday and this morning when I went to Sankhu, I had taken some instant foods noodles, biscuits and juice to distribute to the suffered people. The portion was very very little compared to the victimized people over there and I couldn't afford much which is very sad. I had given some instant noodles to the children and older people, and biscuits and some juice.

"I worked there as a volunteer in the coordination of Turkish rescue team and Nepalese police who were trying to take out the death body from the demolished houses. Turkish volunteers found me very useful as a translator with the local volunteer and police rescue team. So, I did volunteering and translating too, though Turkish people don't speak much English.

"Situation is still very very bad as the rescue teams and volunteers haven't reached yet in the remote areas where people have been suffering a lot and can't imagine what they are doing now over there. People and rescue team are just working in the town and city nearby the district headquarters. More and more International volunteering are trying to come too."
