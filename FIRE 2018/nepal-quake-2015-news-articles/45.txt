Israel was sending a delegation to Nepal Saturday to determine what help it can offer after the massive earthquake there that claimed more than 1,000 lives, officials said.

The military delegation of "medical, search and rescue, logistics and population assistance professionals" was due to fly out at midnight, an army statement said.

A statement from Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's office said the advance team "will land near the affected zone and make its preparations until it becomes possible to land in Nepal".

Besides offering aid to Nepal, the delegation will also provide Israelis "the means necessary to return to Israel", the statement added.

Israel's emergency medical service also announced it would be sending a delegation of paramedics and doctors to Nepal to provide care for both locals and Israelis there.

A statement from Magen David Adom said an aircraft from Israel with equipment and professionals would depart early Sunday to provide immediate help and set up base for further delegations.

Foreign Minister Avigdor Lieberman said there were "thousands" of Israelis in Nepal, adding that no fatalities among them were reported.
