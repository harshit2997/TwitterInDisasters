At least two groups of Slovenians are taking part in trekking expeditions in Nepal, which was hit by a devastating earthquake on Saturday. The Foreign Ministry has established contact, but the information is still patchy.

The ministry said three had already contacted their families in Slovenia to say they were okay. Several others are believed to be in groups that are currently outside of reach of mobile signal.

Media reports meanwhile suggest there are at least four groups of Slovenians in Nepal, with commercial station POP TV reporting about at least 30 people.

The TV station said one group was guided by acclaimed alpine climber Viki Grošelj, while TV Slovenija reported about a group led by another Slovenian star mountaineer Andrej Štremfelj.

The first group started the trekking just as the country was hit by the quake, so they all returned safely to the base.

"The earth just opened up in front of us," Grošelj told his wife over the phone, according to POP TV.

Štremfelj's group was however far away from the epicentre, TV Slovenija said.

Travel agents Shappa and Trek trek also said their groups were safe, waiting for information on how to proceed.

Nepal's infrastructure has been badly damaged, rendering it difficult to secure reliable information.

The Slovenian Embassy in New Delhi is in contact with EU countries' diplomatic missions in Kathmandu trying to check the whereabouts and condition of Slovenians in the country.

Nepal was hit by a 7.8 magnitude earthquake. Hundreds are believed to have died in Nepal as well as India, Bangladesh and Tibet.
