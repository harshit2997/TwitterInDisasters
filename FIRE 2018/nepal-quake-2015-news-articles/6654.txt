WASHINGTON (ABC) – An American helicopter flying above Nepal has been declared missing, a defense official confirmed to ABC News.

Eastburn, the spokesman for U.S. Pacific Command, said that the incident occurred near Charikot, Nepal as the aircraft was conducting humanitarian assistance and disaster relief operations in support of the recent Nepal earthquakes.

Joint Task Force 505 personnel are responding to the emergency and the investigation is under investigation, Eastburn said.

There was a major 7.3-magnitude earthquake in Nepal today, less than three weeks after another earthquake devastated the country.

The epicenter in today’s quake was located near the town of Namche Bazaar, close to Mount Everest.
