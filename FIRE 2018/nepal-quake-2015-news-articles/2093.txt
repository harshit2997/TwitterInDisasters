Kathmandu (Alliance News) - The death toll from the earthquake that hit Nepal at the weekend is more than 3,200, Interior Ministry spokesman Laxmi Dhakal says.

Around 6,238 people were injured in the quake that hit on Saturday, according to the government.

"Lightning and thunder. Haunting feel to the city, yet tens of thousands - or most of city - out on streets, under tarps," Kathmandu-based writer Kashish Das Shrestha tweeted.

Besides the fear caused by numerous aftershocks, people camping in open spaces were suffering a combination of rain, hunger and thirst.

"There is no space. So at least 50 people are crammed in an open area in our neighbourhood," said Pramod Karki, who was staying in a camp near his house in the capital's Kalanki district.

"The old people and children are defecating around the place and that could be a major health hazard."

People were living in small groups in camps, sharing resources as the foul smell and flies started infesting their makeshift homes.

Hospitals damaged by the quake were treating patients in makeshift outdoor clinics outdoors.

Chief Secretary Lilamani Poudel asked all government employees and bodies to work to help the injured and the displaced.

The government said it was preparing to hold mass cremations to prevent diseases from spreading.

The Tourism Ministry said it was also focusing on rescuing the foreigners trapped around the country.

"We rescued around 82 people from the Everest Base Camp yesterday," ministry secretary Suresh Man Shrestha said.

"There are 18 dead bodies on Mount Everest but we brought down only the wounded. Hopefully there will be no more casualties."

"We are also using smaller helicopters and those from the Indian army too for rescue. We are focused on the Everest region and on Gorkha, Dhading, Nuwakot and Sindupalchowk districts."

The Nepal Army has also deployed its forces.

"We have mobilized 90% of our resources," said military official Jagdish Chandra Pokharel. "We're working on a war footing and we request people to do what they can to help people around them."

Prime Minister Sushil Koirala arrived back in Nepal on Sunday after cutting short a visit to Indonesia.

Authorities were struggling with limited capacity to respond to the crisis, he said.

"But we are expecting more foreign help now and now need to work on cremating people, on sanitation, on clean drinking water."

Efforts were also under way to fix phone lines and restore power on Monday, he said.

Aid from around the world was arriving or being promised.

Britain has pledged GBP5 million and Canada has promised CAD5 million.

India was sending in a search and rescue team and Pakistan had set up temporary medical camps.
