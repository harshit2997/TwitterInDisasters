LONDON, April 25 (Xinhua) -- Britain has deployed a team of humanitarian experts to Nepal to provide urgent support to those affected by Saturday's earthquake, the BBC said on Saturday.

The eight-strong team, which includes experts in search and rescue, will travel to Nepal overnight.

The 7.8-magnitude quake struck just before midday local time and is thought to have killed more than 1,000 people.
