US Aid Team Heads to Nepal Quake Zone

<text>
Several dozen US aid workers and rescue dogs headed to Nepal Sunday aboard a military transport plane to provide urgent assistance after the huge earthquake that killed more than 2,500 people.

The C-17 Globemaster aircraft left Dover Air Force Base in Delaware around 11:18 am (1518 GMT) and is expected to land in Nepal on Monday afternoon, the US military said.

"The aircraft is transporting nearly 70 personnel including a USAID Disaster Assistance Response Team (DART), the Fairfax County Urban Search and Rescue team and several journalists, along with 45 square tons of cargo," Pentagon spokesman Colonel Steve Warren said.

A USAID spokeswoman said the cargo was mainly equipment to assist the aid team.

Among the personnel traveling aboard the aircraft are six specially trained dogs, the spokeswoman told AFP.

"We are currently preparing additional shipments," especially emergency shelter material, she said, adding the material should leave the United States in the coming days.

The initial estimated cost of the military's support mission is $700,000 and there are currently no other requests for intervention, officials said.

A total of 26 US military personnel and a C-130 transport plane are currently in Nepal, where they had been due to take part in a previously scheduled training exercise.

No member of the US military is known to be missing in the quake, according to officials.

Meanwhile, members of the Los Angeles County Fire Department (LACoFD) were also heading to quake-devastated Nepal, the LACoFD said on Twitter.

The 57-member task force "has been activated and deploying to Nepal," it tweeted.
