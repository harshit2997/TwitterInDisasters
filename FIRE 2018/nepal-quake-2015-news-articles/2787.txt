Nepali students in the city have been dealing with the news of the devastating earthquake in their hometown by trying to stay in touch with their loved ones as much as possible. Since exams are fast approaching, they have been forced to stay in the city and not head back home now.

“A group of us have planned to book tickets and return after the holidays,” Abhiyan Pawdel, an aeronautical engineering student from Nawal Parasi district said.

While his family lives in his hometown, his brother is in Kathmandu. “He has been living in a park for the past three days, and has been depending on NGOs for food and water,” he said.

However, those whose properties were damaged are worried as to how they can be rebuilt.

Meanwhile, various organisations including the Chennai Kirana Merchants Association (CKMA), Rajasthan Youth Association’s Metro Club, Punjab Association and Lions Club of Chennai Periamet are collecting funds to send aid. Though members of the Punjab Association, Chennai, have set a target of around Rs. 20 lakh, they are not in a violent hurry to send it across, “we are looking for the right NGOs,” said Ramesh Lamba, General Secretary of the Association.

The Rajasthan Youth Association Madras Metro Trust wants the Centre to air lift goods. “We have decided to donate 50 tonnes of rice and dal but are wondering how to move the goods said Trust Chairman Dilip Parmar.

Lions Club of Chennai Periamet’s project chairman G. Ahmed Sharif said, “We are looking for the right contact or Central government sources through which medicines can be sent.”

CKMA vice president Manish Parmar said “We are also waiting to check what kind of aid is required. Mobilising funds is not an issue.”
