UNHCR Rushes Plastic Sheeting, Lamps To Nepal Earthquake Survivors
</headline>

<text>
The UN refugee agency is sending thousands of plastic sheets and solar-powered lamps to people left homeless and without light by the devastating earthquake in Nepal.

Saturday's quake, recorded at 7.8 on the open-ended Richter scale, killed at least 3,600 people and left thousands more injured, according to latest estimates and media reports. Numbers are expected to rise. Many lost their homes and are living in the open or in tent settlements.

UNHCR on Monday responded to a government call for help by sending 11,000 plastic sheets and 4,000 solar-powered lanterns from its warehouse in Damak, eastern Nepal, to the eastern hilly districts of Ramechhap, Okhaldhunga and Sindhuli.

Later Monday afternoon, an additional 8,000 plastic sheets and 4,000 solar lamps are being flown to Kathmandu from Dubai on a cargo flight provided free of charge by Dubai's ruler, Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum. The plastic sheets will be used to construct or repair shelters and the lamps will provide light at night.
