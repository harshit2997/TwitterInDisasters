AS MORE stories of desperation emerge from Nepal following the devastating earthquake last Saturday, the Dubbo community is being encouraged to support through a shelter box call to arms.



A shelter box is a container full of things such as a tent, thermal blankets, basic tool kit, water purification unit and plates and cutlery.

These are ideal for areas that have been struck by a disaster, such as an earthquake, where many survivors are left homeless and with no possessions.

District shelter box representatives Peter and Lorraine Croft have called on Dubbo businesses and the community to donate money to support this great cause.

“The shelter boxes are a great way to help people who have been hit by this devastating earthquake,” Mr Croft said.

“Obviously we have seen how bad it is in Nepal at the moment, so anything we can do to help would be much appreciated.”

People who donate money towards the shelter box cause, can be assured their money is going towards people who are in the most need.

Following the earthquake, response teams have assessed where the worst areas are and in most need of assistance.

This information is then relayed to the various charity organisations and is filtered down to the local representatives, such as the Crofts.

“Its great that we know when we send off the shelter boxes they are going to the areas in most need thanks to the work of the response teams,” Mr Croft said.

“People who donate also get to know exactly where their shelter box is delivered to as each box has a serial number and once it is deployed the donors gets notified where it is and also get a certificate thanking them for their donation.”

Mrs Croft, who is the Dubbo Macquarie Rotary club president, thanked everyone who has already donated.

“Its great that all the local rotary clubs get behind it,” Mrs Croft said.

“Its greatly appreciated all the fundraising that’s been done and hopefully we can raise a lot more.”

For more information or to make a donation please contact Peter on 0427 707 722 or Lorraine on 0488 707 766.
