Churches in Korea to Raise Funds for Nepal
</headline>

<text>
The National Council of Churches in Korea announced Monday that it will launch a fundraising campaign to provide emergency relief to quake-devastated areas in Nepal.



The council plans to deliver the funds through the National Council of Churches of Nepal (NCC) and the Christian Conference of Asia (CCA).



On Sunday, the council sent a letter to NCC General Secretary and CCA President K.B. Rokaya.



In the letter, the council expressed its deep condolences to those who lost loved ones and homes in the earthquake. The council then vowed that Korean churches will exert an all-out effort to heal wounds and rebuild communities destroyed by the quake.
