Almost one million children will not be able to return to school in devastated Nepal, it was revealed today.

Charities said hundreds of schools were destroyed by last month’s huge earthquake.

Unicef said that more than 950,000 school-age children would struggle to get any sort of education when schools are due to reopen on May 15th.

A staggering 24,000 classrooms were badly damaged in the quake which killed almost 8,000 people.

Tomoo Hozumi, Unicef’s Representative in Nepal said: “Almost one million children who were enrolled in school before the earthquake could now find they have no school building to return to.

“Children affected by the earthquake need urgent life-saving assistance like clean water and shelter, but schools in emergencies – even in a temporary setup - play a vital role too.

“There is a desperate need to set up alternative learning spaces, assess and repair buildings, and mount a public awareness campaign encouraging families to send their children back to school and preschool.”

Other charities fear youngsters could be taken from Nepal and trafficked into prostitution.

Bhuwan Ribhu from the charity Bachpan Bachao Andolan said: “Our teams on the ground in Bhaktapur, Gorkha and the surrounding areas of Kathmandu have seen people going there in the name of relief and promising jobs to children and adolescent girls.

“And we fear they will be trafficked for sexual exploitation and for forced labour.”

In the severely-affected districts of Gorkha, Sindhupalchok and Nuwakot, it is estimated that more than 90 per cent of schools have been destroyed.
