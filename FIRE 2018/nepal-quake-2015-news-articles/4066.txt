The Nepalese Government has said that it will never forget the support

extended by Sri Lanka as a true friend at a time it was experiencing a disastrous situation.

The Nepalese Government had made this reference when a delegation including Minister A.H.M. Fowzie visited Nepal to look into the programme mooted by Sri Lankan relief teams.

A delegation including Minister A.H.M. Fowzie, Deputy Minister Anoma Gamage and Prime Minister’s Secretary Saman Ekanayake visited Nepal yesterday to look into the relief operations launched in Nepal with Sri Lanka’s mediation.

A group comprising 98 persons including doctor, assistant doctors and relief workers from the Armed Forces left for Nepal with this delegation. They also carried with them 28 tons comprising food, medicine and essential commodities.

Nepalese President Ram Baran Yadev who met the Sri Lankan representative delegation said that the relief workers from Sri Lanka were engaged in their relief operations sans any hesitation in the Dalalgart town entangled in a dangerous environment.

Nepalese Prime Minister Sushil Koirala described the expression of condolence and support by the Sri Lankan delegation arriving in Nepal as an occasion which has further consolidated the friendship between the two countries.

Meanwhile another group of 22 Sri Lankans displaced as a result of the earthquake in Nepal returned to the island last night. The group comprised students who were pursuing their higher studies and journalists who had fled to Nepal. Also on board were doctors who left for Nepal to provide relief services.
