NEW DELHI: Congress vice-president Rahul Gandhi visited the Nepal embassy in the capital on Friday to pay his tributes to victims of the earthquake, but ended up getting panned on social media for apparently referring to some text on his cellphone while writing the condolence message. TV cameras were quick to spot the cellphone in front of him as he sat writing the message on the visitors' book.TV grabs showed him looking at his phone while writing, apparently to copy down the text he may have earlier keyed in.In no time the Twitterati were making fun of him with the hashtag #PappuCantWriteS**la.The same Twitterati had recently backed him when he took on the Modi government on the issue of net neutrality.On Friday, Rahul met ambassador Deep Kumar Upadhyay, and wrote in the condolence book: "Over the last week, the world has watched in horror as the tragedy in Nepal unfolded.Some wounds will never heal, but as Nepal begins the hard task of rebuilding... the people of India stand with you in strength and solidarity ."(Picture courtesy: @iYashwant/Twitter)
