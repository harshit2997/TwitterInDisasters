THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: Reservation benefits currently enjoyed by members of South Indian United Church (SIUC) will not be affected in any manner, Chief Minister Oommen Chandy told a mammoth rally organised by the church at the Central Stadium here on Tuesday. Without naming the Hariharan Nair Commission constituted by the UDF Government to study the social, economic and educational backwardness of Nadar community, Chandy said that the government’s objective was only to study whether certain ‘deserving sections’ are also eligible for reservation benefits.

“If any section of society demands its rights, it is the government’s duty to get it examined. This should not raise any concerns as no benefits currently enjoyed by SIUC members will be affected in any manner,” Chandy said amid loud cheers from the crowd.

Earlier, Bishop and President of SIUC Dharmaraj Rasalam demanded that the reservation benefits to members of the community, which was obtained after a lot of struggle, should be protected. He also raised objections to the terms of reference of the Hariharan Nair Commission.

Rasalam criticised the terms of reference of the Commission relating to extension of reservation benefits to members of the Nadar community irrespective of religion and the proposal for entering caste and religion of Nadar community members in certificates.

Ministers Ramesh Chennithala and V S Sivakumar, who spoke after Chandy, also gave the same assurance to SIUC members. Chennithala said that the government believed in ‘inclusive development’ and stated that no benefits provided to any community would be affected in the process.

While Chennithala distributed scholarships to meritorious students, Sivakumar flagged off the free ambulance service launched by the Church.

CPM state secretary Kodiyeri Balakrishnan distributed the financial assistance to cancer patients. Marriage assistance and wheelchairs were distributed by Mayor K Chandrika and K Muraleedharan MLA, respectively.

Rasalam also submitted a charter of demands by SIUC to the Chief Minister on the occasion.
