MENTAL health worker and Rotary Club of Orange Daybreak member Robyn Murray is safe and hopefully on her way back to Sydney after surviving the earthquake that hit Nepal on Saturday.

Yesterday, Ms Murray’s colleagues expressed their relief that she and her fellow Rotary volunteers were safe.

“We are very happy and relieved that our colleague Robyn Murray is safe and well following the devastating earthquake in Nepal,” said Director of Integrated Mental Health, Drug and Alcohol Services, Jason Crisp.

“We admire and support the volunteer efforts made by Robyn and our other mental health professionals in the wonderful work they do in Nepal with the Rotary Club of Orange Daybreak.”

Ms Murray first went to Nepal in 2012 and has returned each year to deliver health programs to the people of Nepal.

Before last year’s trip Ms Murray said mental health services were virtually non existent in Nepal and the population struggled on many levels to access health services.

A family member said following the initial reports of the earthquake they were frustrated at not being able to contact the Australian Embassy for information, but had since heard from Ms Murray.

“The message she sent through was that she was in a shop at the time the earthquake hit and items began falling on her so she ran out and managed to get back to the hotel,” the relative said.

“The first message we got was from 2.38am on April 26 saying she was sleeping in her clothes and shoes as they were expecting a big aftershock.”
