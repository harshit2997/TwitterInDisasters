China and India send rescue workers to quake-struck Nepal
</headline>

<text>
China and India both sent rescue teams to Nepal after a 7.8-magnitude earthquake hit the strategically important Himalayan country Saturday, killing more than 2,4000, The Wall Street Journal reported. China dispatched a 62-member search-and-rescue team as well as six sniffer dogs and medical equipment on Sunday, according to state news agency Xinhua; India had sent four aircraft carrying nearly 300 disaster-response personnel and a mobile hospital to the Nepalese capital Katmandu on Saturday. India has long seen Nepal as within its sphere of influence, while inroads made by China have heated up the countries' rivalry as the pace of Chinese investment has increased.
