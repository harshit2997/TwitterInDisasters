April 25: Strong tremors were felt across the Northeast, triggering panic among the people and leaving buildings with cracks, prompting the administration to get into disaster-management mode.

Though there were reports of property being damaged in different parts of the region, there were no reports of death or injury.

In Guwahati, people came out of high-rises that house offices in the heart of the city. Many residents came out of their houses in the city and its suburbs.

Kamrup (metro) deputy commissioner M. Angamuthu told The Telegraph that the administration had received reports of minor cracks in 30 government and private buildings in the city.

The administration has constituted a joint team with magistrates and officials from the PWD and Guwahati Metropolitan Development Authority to inspect the damages.

Assam chief minister Tarun Gogoi, who is in New Delhi, asked chief secretary Jitesh Khosla to take stock of the post-earthquake situation and survey loss of property, if any, in the state.

He also asked Khosla to check if any individual from the state was stranded in Nepal and to ensure his/her safe return.

The administration has designated additional deputy commissioner Rajiv Prakash Barua as the nodal officer to coordinate relief measures and rescue of missing persons from Assam in Nepal.

Barua can be contacted at 09435014676.

Several buildings in lower Assam have reportedly developed cracks.

Tremors were also felt in several parts of Meghalaya amid a heavy downpour. However, till the filing of this report, there were no reports of any loss of life or damage to property.

A. C. Lyngdoh, meteorologist, Central Seismological Observatory, Shillong, said, "The magnitude of the quake would remain the same but the intensity would be less in the Northeast due to the distance from the epicentre."

Most parts of Manipur also experienced the tremors.

There were reports of several buildings developing cracks, including a government school in Imphal East, sources said. But there was no report of collapse of buildings or human casualties.

Tremors were also felt across Arunachal Pradesh but no casualty was reported.
