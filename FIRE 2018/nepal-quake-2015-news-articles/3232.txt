Paul Sutherland, founder of Utopia Foundation main goal revolves around speed and efficiency.

“Our main goal is how fast can we get resources on the ground and help them.”

He founded the utopia foundation in Traverse City.

After the Nepal earthquake, he felt he had to do something.

“Right now we’re looking at suitcases and boxes go and then we’re trying to find organizations we can partner with to get resources on the ground right away.”

The Utopia Foundation is trying to help nearly 50 orphaned children in Nepal adopted by Pushpa Basnet.

Pushpa visited Traverse City’s film festival last year after her work was made into a documentary.

The foundation’s been in contact with her ever since.

“They don’t have food, so i think about when i can old my 2 year old and he’s hungry and just think about you having no food.”

Before the earthquake hit, Pushpa was building an early childhood development center to house the children.

The kids are now staying in a green house and feeding them is getting very difficult.

“Getting food in there is really hard and getting trucks in there is not happening, some prices have gone up 10 times.”

Executive Director of the Utopia Foundation, Lindy Bishop says Pushpa and the kids have limited resources.

“They have some noodles to eat. They have water to drink and they don’t have any water for bathing or taking care other needs. they don’t know and we don’t know how long that needs to last, but they are predicting just a couple more days.”

There are some ways anyone can help.

“Donating money is helpful. Another thing is praying for the children and praying for the people. If they have skills think about volunteering.”
