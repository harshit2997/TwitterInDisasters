A search and rescue team made up of firefighters from Burnaby, B.C., says Calgary yoga instructor Tamara McLeod has been airlifted to safety in Nepal.

McLeod, 24, was in area called Briddim in Nepal's Langtang region when the 7.8 earthquake rocked the country on Saturday, leaving thousands dead and homeless.

She contacted her family after the quake, saying she was trapped with four other people near the village, with limited food, water and shelter and they were desperate to get out.

After learning of McLeod's coordinates, a team of firefighters from Burnaby, B.C., which is camped out with the Canadian Medical Assistance Team at the E.O.D. Holding Unit at Kathmandu Airport, reached out to contacts at the Nepalese Army Base near Briddim and asked for their assistance.

They were later told that McLeod and the other hikers were evacuated to Dhunche where they were catching a bus to Kathmandu.

McLeod was reportedly in Nepal teaching yoga at the time of the quake.
