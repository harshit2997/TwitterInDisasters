A magnitude 7.8 earthquake slammed Nepal on Saturday and killed more than 3,400 people. It's emotional impact has been felt across the world, including in New Hampshire.

Sheila Rapalje just returned from Thailand where she was visiting her son, Jeff Stryker, and daughter-in-law at their home. Stryker and three friends flew to Nepal this week to climb a mountain west of Kathmandu.

“Before he left I hugged him, I said I wish you weren't going. But he said, ‘Mom, it's a challenge I want to take,’” Rapalje said.

Rapalje said her son may have been on the mountain Saturday when the earthquake hit.

“He is not that far [from the quake] and the aftershock is causing avalanches in the mountains. And the aftershocks are still happening. It’s very scary,” Rapalje said.

Rapalje told News 9 Sunday morning that her son and the other members of his group are safe. She said they did not feel much of the earthquake and were continuing with their trek.

A North Conway, New Hampshire family was also relieved Saturday night. Rick and Celia Wilcox, the owners of International Mountain Equipment, were also mountain climbing in Nepal Saturday.

Rick's brother talked to their guide service, which said the couple is currently two hours south of the Mount Everest base camp and safe.
