We are with our people, say Gurkhas

The Gurkhas have said they hope their homeland will prevail despite suffering a "natural disaster of unthinkable magnitude" during the Nepal earthquake.

Last week's quake devastated the heartlands of the British Army brigade of Nepalese soldiers and a team of its engineers has travelled to the country to help with the rescue effort.

As 200 Gurkhas marched in London today to mark the brigade's 200 years of service to Britain, their thoughts were also inevitably with their home country.

Gurkha Major Dev Gurung said: "The tragedy in Nepal has slightly overshadowed what we were planning for some years.

"But we are still here as a family of both serving and retired Gurkhas and also our families to commemorate our service to the Crown and the country.

"As a regiment and as a nation we have suffered this natural disaster of unthinkable magnitude.

"Of course the road will be long but we are very hopeful that we will prevail."

The Gurkhas were marching from Wellington Barracks, past Buckingham Palace and along the Mall before arriving at the Gurkha memorial statue in Whitehall.

Rifleman Sanjib Rai, of Second Battalion The Royal Gurkha Rifles, who has served with the regiment since he was 17, sent a message of support to his countrymen.

Now aged 23, he said: "We are feeling really sad but what we want to say is that we are with them (the Nepalese people).

"My village, Khotang, has been affected, so many houses are damaged, but luckily nobody died.

"So many people and so many countries are helping so I think in some years it will be all right."

Captain Gary Ghale, 60, formerly of the 6th Queen Elizabeth's Own Gurkha Rifles, said communication with people in villages such as his native Gorkha was proving very difficult.

"To see all these heart-wrenching pictures, I am just praying, just praying for the safety of the people of Nepal and that help reaches people in time and there is proper sanitisation because the aftermath can kill more people than the earthquake itself," he said.

The 3,000-strong Brigade of Gurkhas traces its heritage to the Gurkha units that served in the British Indian Army before Indian independence.

Nepal suffered the 7.8-magnitude earthquake on Saturday. It has claimed more than 5,000 lives.
