</headline>

<text>
The Icelandic Red Cross has sent two additional representatives to Nepal following the earthquake there last month. Nurse Helga Pálmadóttir arrived in Kathmandu yesterday and psychologist Elín Jónasdóttir is expected to arrive in the country today. They join Icelandic electrical technician Ríkharður Már Pétursson who has been in Nepal since shortly after the earthquake, visir.is reports.

Elín, who has extensive experience as an employee, volunteer and delegate for the Red Cross, will join the team which is assessing the need for aid in the country. She will lead all planning and analytical work related to trauma therapy and psychological support. Elín has previously worked in emergency situations in Haiti, the Philippines and Sierra Leone.

Helga will work as a ward nurse in the tent hospital of the Norwegian Red Cross in Chautara in northern Nepal. Helga has extensive education and experience as a nurse and has worked at the Landspítal National University Hospital’s emergency room. She will work together with Ríkharður.

A magnitude 7.3 earthquake struck Nepal this morning, two weeks after more than 8,000 people died in a devastating 7.8 earthquake. Dozens of people are reported to have died in the latest quake, bbc.com reports.
