Rescuers are battling to reach survivors of a deadly new earthquake in Nepal that triggered landslides and brought down buildings on Tuesday.

Nepalese authorities say seasonal monsoon rains in the coming weeks could also trigger further landslides.

Dozens of people were killed and more than 1000 injured in the worst tremor following the magnitude-7.8 earthquake that hit on April 25, killing more than 8000 people and leaving hundreds of thousands homeless.

Diwakar Koirala, deputy administrator in Sindhupalchowk district, said Tuesday’s quake caused three more big landslides.

The Nepal army resumed its aerial search for a US Marine Corps helicopter that went missing during a disaster relief operation in eastern Nepal, near where the latest quake hit.

The Pentagon has said there may have been a problem with fuel on the chopper, which was carrying six US Marines and two Nepal army soldiers when it disappeared.

“We have been informed that an American helicopter has gone missing, search operations have begun,” the Nepal Home Ministry spokesman Laxmi Prasad Dhakal said.

Mr Dhakal said 65 people had been confirmed dead so far in the latest quake, which was centred 76km east of Kathmandu, and also killed 17 people in northern India.

“We had been focusing on relief distribution, but from yesterday our resources were deployed for rescue operations again,” he said.

Tuesday’s quake was felt as far away as New Delhi, and caused buildings to collapse in Tibet in neighbouring China, killing at least one person there.

A second tremor of 6.3-magnitude struck Nepal about 30 minutes later, followed by more aftershocks, according to the USGS.
