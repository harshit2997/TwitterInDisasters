“We desperately want to go back home to be with our families whereas some of our batchmates, who had gone there before the earthquake, are keen to come back as examinations are around the corner. This is a strange situation, we are feeling helpless,” said a student from Nepal studying at the PEC University of Technology.

There are around 50 students hailing from different parts of Nepal who are at PEC. While half of them are undergoing internship training, the others are pursuing civil engineering. But all of them are shaken to the core, scared that tragedy might strike again back home.

“Though our families are safe, the fear of another earthquake is still there,” said Devashish, a final-year student.

His friends Sudridh, Gaurav, Nirajan and Saurav said that their families were safe in Nepal, and had taken refuge in shelter homes and nearby police stations.

“My family and my house are safe. My parents informed me that our neighbouring house is completely shattered and one of their family members has died during the earthquake. Minor cracks have appeared in our house,” Nirajan said.

The students are happy that they have been able to speak to their families. “Thanks to telecom companies such as Airtel, BSNL and Idea, communication is not a problem. I had spoken to my mother this morning but am not able to get through to them now,” said Devashish.

Said Gaurav, “Two of our friends had gone to attend their sister’s wedding in Kathmandu, which took place a day before the earthquake. Now both of them are stuck there.”

The students said the problem of food and water was less in the Central part of Kathmandu but it was severe on the outskirts.

While they are praying that no more tremors should come, they are pretty sure of one thing — their fighting spirit. “We belong to the land of Gurkhas. We stay brave and strong even at the harshest of times. As of now, we might lack in resources but with good wishes pouring in from all over the word, we will slowly but surely rise again,” said Devashish.
