SAN DIEGO -- It is unlikely that any of the six U.S. Marines and two Nepalese soldiers believed to have been aboard a helicopter that crashed on a steep Himalayan mountainside in earthquake-stricken Nepal survived, authorities said Friday after the wreckage was discovered.

The helicopter, based at Camp Pendleton and attached to Marine Light Helicopter Squadron 469, disappeared over the town of Charikot hours after a magnitude-7.3 earthquake struck the region earlier this week.

Marine Lt. Gen. John Wissler, Commanding General, III Marine Expeditionary Force, Joint Task Force 505 and Marine Forces Japan, said during a news conference in Nepal that the wreckage of the UH-1Y Huey was found about 8 miles north of Charikot shortly before 2 p.m. today Nepal Standard Time in "exceptionally rugged terrain'' in a dense forest at an altitude of about 11,000 feet.

"Because of the nature of the wreckage, it is unlikely that there are any survivors at this time,'' Wissler said. "Our prayers are with the Marines and the Nepalese soldiers and their families. We all mourn this tragic loss of life.''

Wissler said he could not positively identify the cause of the crash nor could he confirm the identities of the service members, American or Nepalese, who were aboard the aircraft.

The UH-1Y Huey was on a disaster-relief mission called "Operation Sahayogi Haat'' when it was reported missing Tuesday morning, approximately nine hours after Nepal was struck by a magnitude-7.3 aftershock to the magnitude-7.8 temblor of April 25. The initial earthquake killed more than 8,200 people while the big aftershock claimed another 117 lives.

The helicopter and squadron were diverted from a Joint Task Force exercise in the Philippines to assist with search and rescue.

"They were determined to go forward with their duties, eager to contribute to our mission and to alleviate suffering and to come to the rescue of those in need,'' Wissler said. "They were courageous. They were selfless individuals dedicated to the international humanitarian aid mission here in Nepal. We are deeply saddened by the discovery of this wreckage.''

Aircraft from the United States, India and Nepal had searched for the missing helicopter before it was found.

U.S. Army Maj. Dave Eastburn, spokesman for U.S. Pacific Command, said an assessment of the site was ongoing and a thorough investigation would be conducted.
