As the Indian government undertakes its biggest overseas relief and rescue mission in quake-hit Nepal, India Inc has got into the act as well, acting as a force multiplier to official efforts and adding to the country's most expansive overseas humanitarian intervention to date.From large conglomerates to tiny startups, corporate India is pulling out all the stops to aid the rescue mission in Nepal, offering men, money and materials on a scale never done in the past. From blankets to drinking water to medicines to food to discounted air fares to simply cash, a steadily growing parade of companies is committing resources to help the stricken neighbour, where the number of deaths crossed 4,000.Employees at Godrej Industries will contribute one day's salary for the quake victims and also assist in rehabilitation and reconstruction work, a spokesperson said. Beverage maker Coca-Cola sent 10,000 cases of 1-litre Kinley water bottles on Sunday and is working out ways to provide water to the affected areas, the company said.ATata Sons spokesperson said the conglomerate was in touch with government agencies while an official with the group's flagship Tata Consultancy Services said plans were afoot at the group level to provide financial assistance to the victims.The Mahindra & Mahindra Group has asked its local distributor in Nepal to offer the company's tractors and pick-up vehicles to the government for rehabilitation work. "We do hope and pray that our humble support helps the earthquake victims in Nepal and in the affected parts of India to get back to normalcy at the earliest," said Chairman & Managing Director Anand Mahindra Cigarettes and consumer goods behemoth ITC's subsidiary Surya Nepal, which is one of the largest corporate entities in the Himalayan nation, has sent 200,000 food packets and supplied nine tonnes of its Sunfeast biscuits and Yippee! instant noodles. FMCG firms such as Emami, PepsiCo, Rasna and Dabur, all of which have sizeable business operations in Nepal, too have sprung into action. Dabur 's subsidiary in Nepal, which generates more than .`200 crore in business a year, has supplied packs of juices and glucose to the survivors in Nepal and is also offering healthcare through a dispensary it runs there as CSR initiative.Emami, which generates around.`40 crore business from Nepal, has mobilised field volunteers with basic necessities such as blankets and medicines while beverage maker Rasna will dispatch seven tonnes of glucose powder and milkshake mix to aid the earthquake survivors.And it's not just the big daddies of India Inc that are helping with the country's soft power projection. Startups too have got into the act, underlining their growing importance in India's corporate landscape.IdeaForge, a startup that makes drones, has deployed an unmanned aerial vehicle system, along with the National Disaster Response Force (NDRF), to Kathmandu and other villages in Nepal for site surveillance to help with the rescue efforts. "The drone should reach today. We are planning to send out our own teams to Nepal after we hear back from NDRF," said Ankit Mehta, co-founder and chief executive of the startup, whose drones were purchased by NDRF more than a year ago.Payment wallet Oxigen has offered 1% of its daily transactions as a donation to Nepal victims every day for the coming month. Another one — Paytm — is offering coupons that allow users to contribute to victims. While recharging or paying a bill, users can pick a "Nepal" coupon with values ranging from .`10 to .`10,000. Paytm will match donation of users rupee for rupee and deposit contributions to a relief fund run by the Indian government. Online shopping site Shopclues too has put up a donation page on its website and promises to match donations by customers by stumping up an equivalent amount.Jombay, a talent assessment and analytics company, said it will run 'counselling chat rooms' for students in Nepal in partnership with mig33, a mobile chat community which has 10 million users in Nepal.Jombay's psychologists will log into mig33's chatrooms and counsel people to deal with the tragedy. "Nepal is a mobile-first country with millions of people actively using mobile social networks," said CEO Mohit Gundecha, adding that social media will be turned into counseling rooms and 'virtual companions' will be provided in the next few weeks.The company is also looking to fund travel plans along with medical and food supplies of 25 Nepalese watchmen in Pune so they can travel home to meet their families at the earliest.For them and many others, including relief crews, airline companies are doing their bit to make it easier and cheaper.No-frills carrier SpiceJet slashed base fares for its evening flights to Kathmandu to .`1 for two days starting Monday and announced it would operate two more special flights to aid evacuation of travellers stranded in Nepal. SpiceJet has also created a special email ID for accredited NGOs and relief organisations to contact the airline for free carriage of relief materials, doctors and rescue personnel to Kathmandu.And it is not alone. Air India has also reduced the one-way fare between the Indian cities of Delhi, Kolkata and Varanasi and Kathmandu from .`14,000 to .`4,700 inclusive of taxes, and will fly relief materials on priority.
