The group, members of the People's Liberation Army, are being tasked with spraying down areas with disinfectants to try to prevent the outbreak of disease in the Nepalese quake zone. "This is my first time performing a mission abroad, and I'm a little unused to the climate and environment here. It's a little hotter than in our country, but I can take it. We have a job to do, no matter the hardships or high temperatures."



At the same time, a Chinese medical team has begun treating injured children at a hillside orphanage on the outskirts of Kathmandu.



The orphanage itself collapsed during the earthquake.



Around 50 children are now living in tents.



Liu Haifeng, head of the Chinese medical team, says their biggest concern is also disease control. "Epidemics are unlikely to break out here because it is situated halfway up the hill with only a small number of people around. This place also enjoys good ventilation and a clean environment. I looked around when I arrived here and found no contaminated water sources."



The death toll from the 7.8-magnitude earthquake which jolted Nepal 10-days ago has now surpassed 75-hundred.
