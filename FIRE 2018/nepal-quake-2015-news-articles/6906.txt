The death toll in the latest earthquake to hit Nepal has risen to 76, with more than 19 hundred injured.

Tuesday's magnitude-7.5 quake was centered in villages and towns east of the capital Kathmandu. It hit as the country was only just beginning to pick up the pieces after the massive 8.1 temblor last month.

More than 8,000 people died in that earthquake, and tens of thousands were left displaced. Many never had the chance to return home, and said they only survived the second quake because they were already living in tents.

Schools across the country have postponed their reopening date to the end of the month. The Nepalese government has appealed for aid agencies to stay in the country. And more funding is desperately needed for relief work.

The United Nations said it has only raised a fraction of the 400 million dollars that's needed to help the country recover from the April 25 quake.
