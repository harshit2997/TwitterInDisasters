Blackpool Vic doctor’s Nepal mercy mission
</headline>

<text>
A Fylde coast doctor is returning home to disaster-struck Nepal to give medical help in some of the country’s most remote areas.

Dr Rajib Maharjan, 31, who works at Blackpool Victoria Hospital, and is originally from capital city Kathmandu, will travel to Nepal on Saturday to offer his services.

An estimated 10,000 people are thought to have been killed, tens of thousands injured and a further eight million affected by the 7.8-magnitude quake on Saturday.

Dr Maharjan, who lives in Blackpool, said: “I just want to help. I’m excited to be going although I know it is still dangerous.

“My parents and my sister live in Kathmandu. They are OK but they are still feeling aftershocks. I decided to go when I saw lots of people sharing Facebook messages that they needed doctors.

“I will be going to countryside areas like Gorkha and Sindhupalchok. The senior doctors are arranging for helicopters to take us there. I’m going with 20 other doctors from Nepal.

“Some places are not easily accessible so we might have to walk. I will be going for two weeks.”

Mike Russell, 42, from St Annes, Kirkham man Sam Stalker, 25 and Jonathan Blott, 24, also from Kirkham, were caught up in the disaster.

The trio are safe and well, but concerns remain for their welfare as they are stranded in some of the most remote parts of the country.

Dr Maharjan’s wife Ruchi, 29, who is a doctor at the Royal Lancaster Infirmary, is also going with Rajib to give medical aid.

Relatives in the UK will look after their three-year-old daughter Trisha while the couple are in Nepal.

Dr Maharjan works in paediatrics in the Women and Children’s Unit at Blackpool Victoria Hospital and before worked as a doctor in St Annes.

He is a member of the Nepalese Doctors’ Association UK and will be travelling to the earthquake zone with members of the association. He will use some of his holiday entitlement to go to Nepal.

Dr Maharjan added: “The people of Nepal are greatly in need of doctors as well as food, clothing and shelter.

“I hope people will support the appeal.”

The Disasters Emergency committee (DEC) has started an appeal to raise funds for victims. For further information go to www.dec.org.uk
