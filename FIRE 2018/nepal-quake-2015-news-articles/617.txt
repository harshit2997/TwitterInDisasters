A day after massive earthquake shook Nepal, Shiv Sena which is part of BJP-led NDA government at the Centre here announced to donate salaries of its MPs for the relief and rehabilitation of the victims.



"Praying for the calm and the safety of all the people across the #Nepal earthquake radius and whoever has been affected by it," Yuva Sena chief Aditya Thackeray tweeted.



Ruling alliance partner in Maharashtra and the oldest ally of BJP, Shiv Sena has 18 Lok Sabha and three Rajya Sabha MPs."All Shiv Sena MPs will give their 1 month's salary to the Prime Minister's relief fund for the Nepal earthquake relief.
