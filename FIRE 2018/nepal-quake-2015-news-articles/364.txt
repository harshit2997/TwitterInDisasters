</headline>

<text>
Taipei, April 25 (CNA) Taiwan's Ministry of Foreign Affairs on Saturday issued a travel alert urging people not to travel to Nepal following a magnitude 7.8 earthquake in the South Asian country earlier in the day that has killed hundreds.



In a statement, the ministry called on Taiwanese nationals to postpone their plans to visit Nepal.



The earthquake, the worst to strike Nepal since 1934, occurred approximately 80 kilometers to the northeast of the country's capital of Kathmandu, according to the U.S. Geological Survey.



More than 700 people were reported dead as of Saturday night, and many buildings had collapsed in the capital and in areas near the quake's epicenter, foreign media reported.



Aftershocks continued to ripple through the region in the hours following the major earthquake. Rescuers are reportedly digging through the rubble of collapsed buildings in the capital trying to reach survivors.
