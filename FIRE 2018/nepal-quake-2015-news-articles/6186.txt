PanARMENIAN.Net - Rescue work has resumed to find victims and survivors of the latest deadly earthquake to hit Nepal.

At least 65 people died in Nepal and nearly 2,000 were hurt in 7.4 magnitude quake on Tuesday, May 12, with fears the figures could rise. At least 17 died in India, BBC News reports.

A search continues for a missing U.S. aid helicopter with eight people on board.

Thousands of Nepalis spent the night in the open. Many have not returned to their homes since a 7.8 magnitude quake on April 25 that killed over 8,000.

Tuesday's earthquake was centered about 76km (47 miles) east of the capital, Kathmandu, near the town of Namche Bazaar.

A second tremor of 6.3-magnitude hit Nepal 30 minutes later and numerous other aftershocks continued into Wednesday morning.

The main quake was felt in northern India, Tibet and Bangladesh. India's home ministry said 16 people had been killed in the state of Bihar, and one more in Uttar Pradesh. Officials in China said one person was confirmed dead in Tibet.

Nepal's districts of Dolakha and Sindhupalchowk, east of the capital, were initially listed as the worst hit, with officials confirming 26 fatalities, 20 of them in the town of Charikot.

Home Minister Bam Dev Gautam said: "Many houses have collapsed in Dolakha... there is a chance that the number of dead from the district will go up."

The U.S. military said a Marine Corps Huey helicopter involved in disaster relief efforts had gone missing while working in the vicinity of Charikot.

The Pentagon said there were six U.S. Marines and two Nepali soldiers on board. It said there was as yet no sign of a crash and the craft may have landed safely, amid reports of fuel issues.

A Nepalese army helicopter is searching for the missing aircraft.

The Red Cross said it had received reports of many casualties in the town of Chautara in Sindhupalchowk, where it has a hospital and which has become a hub for humanitarian aid.

At least two major buildings collapsed in Kathmandu, with at least three people rescued. But there have been other reports of landslides and fallen buildings in towns and villages outside the capital.
