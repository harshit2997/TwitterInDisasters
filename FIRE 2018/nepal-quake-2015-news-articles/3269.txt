The family of Dr. Remi Drozd, 34, said he wasn't hurt when Saturday's earthquake struck. They said he's now working to help others.

Drozd spent his childhood in Gilford, and his mother said there was never a question that he would become a doctor.

"He was bringing dead animals to the house, which I had to find under his bed, because he said 'I'm going to save them,'" said his mother, Elizabeth Drozd.

After graduating from Gilford High School, Remi Drozd went on to become a doctor of emergency services. His mother said his adventurous spirit and desire to help others took him to Nepal.

In February, he started his work, backpacking between isolated villages to tend to the sick.

"It was like 100 years ago. They didn't know what to do," his mother said. "They die in pain or quietly without any medical help."

Days before Saturday's earthquake struck, Remi Drozd called his mother to say he would be out of contact as they traveled to help the poor

He and another doctor were above the snow line when the 7.8-magnitude earthquake rocked the region. Instead of continuing onto the next village, the two headed back to headquarters for help.

"When they climbed down, they found that the village was completely destroyed," his mother said. "Not even one building was standing. So instead of seeking help for himself, he dropped everything and started to help people."

She said the family would spend the next few days terrified that something had happened to him.

"When he called me, it was the middle of the night," she said. "It was around 3 o'clock in the morning. I was sleeping with my phone by my pillow. He said, 'Mom, I am OK, but I am needed, and I have to help others.'"

Elizabeth Drozd said she has mixed feelings.

"I'm very proud as a mother of a doctor, but I'm very scared as the mother of my son," she said.

She said she's not sure when her son will be home, but his wife is arranging to meet him in Nepal. The two will then make the journey home to the United States.
