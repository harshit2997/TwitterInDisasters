</headline>

<text>
Greenwich Council is collecting donations at the town hall following the devastating earthquake in Nepal.

Having one of the highest Nepalese communities in London, Greenwich is offering aid to earthquake victims in the country, where more than 3,000 people have died.

Mayor of Greenwich Councillor Mick Hayes and leader Councillor Denise Hyland are encouraging people to bring essential items to Woolwich town hall in Wellington Street or the Eltham Centre.

Items needed include sleeping bags, blankets, wind-up or solar torches, toiletries, dried fruit, cartons or bottles of water, children's clothing, baby food and milk, packet food and cutlery.

The items will be collected by a charity called Skills and Care, who are working closely with the Nepalese embassy.

Director of Skills and Care Fatta Thapa said: "We will be doing all we can to reach some of the more remote villages that have been affected".

To donate money, visit the Disasters Emergency Committee website or call 0370 60 60 900.
