A Nepalese grandmother described pulling her baby granddaughter out of the mud minutes after the quake.

NEPAL - A Nepalese grandmother has described pulling her three month old granddaughter out of the mud just minutes after a 7.9 magnitude earthquake hit the country last weekend.

The devastating quake has claimed the lives of over 6,000 people.

Some Nepalese say they have regular nightmares fearing another quake could hit the country.

Relief group Gift of the Givers is in Nepal helping survivors and has been joined by 33 doctors who will help with surgery at a local hospital in Kathmandu.

Sixty-five-year-old Mya Buddhachari sits on the floor at the Shyambhu Buddhist temple, tears streaming down her cheeks - as she recalls her family's brush with death through a translator.

"Everyone ran outside but when she ran outside she couldn't find her granddaughter she later found the baby in mud."

She shares a tent erected here on the top level of the temple with several other women - as well as limited clothing food and belongings.

A dog is chained to one woman's hand, both sleep on the floor, waiting for some relief aid.

They believe God saved their lives.

Meanwhile, Parents of the 18 Pretoria school girls who were left stranded last week during the earthquake have expressed their relief at their children's safe rerun home.

The pupils from St Mary's School touched down safely at OR Tambo International Airport this morning.

They left last month, as part of the World Challenge Team, an organisation that arranges educational expeditions across the globe.

A mother says she's delighted at having her daughter back.

"I'm so thankful."

MORE AID ARRIVES

Efforts by Gift of the Givers have been bolstered by the arrival of an additional 33 medical workers with extra medicine and rescue equipment.

The group's doctors have started performing surgeries at the Kirtipur hospital in Kathmandu and among their first patients was a nine-year-old.

Dr Livan Turino says Nepalese doctors have been welcoming their South African counterparts, something which medical personnel don't usually do.

Vital search and rescue equipment has now also arrived and the aid group is planning to visit a rural village tomorrow.
