KATMANDU, Nepal — Harish Chandra Pandiya was out with his wife when the building they live in with their two teenage daughters collapsed in Saturday's earthquake. Monday, he stood outside for a second day, watching rescuers try to find survivors — and prayed.

"I pray to God they find my daughters," ages 12 and 16. "I know it's too late. I hope they find their bodies now," he said, looking tired and stricken.

Rescue operations continue in this capital city, but rescuers, family of the missing and officials began to lose hope. Hundreds of damaged sites need to be carefully searched for survivors — and to recover any remains.

"Because of the way the buildings were constructed, it's really difficult to carry out rescue operations without damaging other buildings," said Phenindra Ghole of the Nepal Armed Police Force, taking part in rescue operations. "We worked all day and only found one person. It's a tricky operation."

He spoke Monday at the site of what had been a three-story building in a neighborhood close to downtown Katmandu. Five people were rescued Sunday by Nepalese police working with Chinese rescue teams, but the operation had to shut down after dark — leaving five others still inside, he said. The one person they found Monday had died overnight.

"We have to move really slowly," Ghole said. "Obviously, that is not good for those who are trapped. We hope to get to them in time."

Wang Sheznghui, part of the Chinese rescue teams flown in to assist, said his group had been working on one of the collapsed buildings for three hours after spotting a body, but they were unable to successfully retrieve it.

"We kept trying, for hours. We have to be really careful not to damage the bodies," he said. "We have to respect the feelings of the people here. After all, we came to help."

He said his team will "keep working as long as we are needed."

As the death toll from the magnitude-7.8 earthquake continues to rise — topping 4,000 Monday — overwhelmed hospitals try to help those who were injured. At Bir Hospital, the largest in Katmandu, 6,500 people have been treated there alone, and the number is climbing.

Rescuers and medical personnel from numerous countries have arrived, including teams from India, Pakistan, Bhutan, Bangladesh, the United Kingdom, Poland and the USA, according to Khem Karki of Nepal's Health Ministry.

"We desperately need trained medical personnel to come help us," he said. "The only thing we ask is that they coordinate with us and WHO (the World Health Organization) so that we can deploy them where they are most needed."

On the streets, people are still in fear as aftershocks continued Monday. Residents dragged mattresses outside to sleep, then wake up and go through their daily activities outdoors — drinking tea, reading newspapers, cooking — so they wouldn't be trapped if another aftershock brought down their home.

At the Army Parade Grounds, an iconic landmark usually closed to the public, a sea of blue tents housed many who lost their homes and others who refused to stay in their intact ones.

Foreign travelers tried to call home, but communications remained unreliable for most of the day. Others searched for missing loved ones or stood silently outside buildings undergoing rescue operations, hoping for their sons, daughters, mothers or friends to be found.

Pandiya, who is originally from Bihar, India, and moved to Nepal for work two years ago, said he can't believe what happened.

"I came to Nepal with so much hope," he said. "I found a good job. I wanted to provide an education for my daughters and a good life for my family. Who knew we would be eventually living through this complete nightmare?"
