The still-rising death toll from the quake, Nepal’s worst in more than 80 years, has reached more than 7,500.

Kathmandu police say nearly 900,000 people have left in the past 10 days. The population of Kathmandu valley — including the city of Kathmandu and smaller towns of Lalitpur and Bhaktapur — is 2.5 million people.



Life has been slowly returning to normal in Kathmandu. Schools are to remain closed until May 14 but some markets are open and trucks have been bringing in fresh food and vegetables every day.

As the task of rebuilding looms for the impoverished nation, foreign aid is expected to play a big role. – The Associated Press
