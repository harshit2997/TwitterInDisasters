IN THE wake of the Nepal disaster, a local resident has organised a sponsored walk in order to donate to Nepal and restore the devastated villages.

Gareth Davies, 47, is planning to walk from Portland to Golden Cap to raise money that will directly help those who have been affected in the earthquake which devastated the country only a couple of weeks ago.

Nepal was hit with an earthquake which affected the areas in and surrounding Saurpani, between capital Kathmandu and the tourist town of Pokhara.

Gareth, who works at Dorset County Hospital (DCH) as a storeman, has friends in Nepal which he met on a trip to the country last year in Pokhara.

He regularly keeps in contact with them and after the earthquake received word that the three men, all in their early 20s were safe, but some of them had lost friends and family to the harrowing consequences of the earthquake.

The three of them are currently living in tents in Kathmandu, while the country awaits emergency funds from various charities and the death toll rises.

Following the natural disaster, Gareth said that he felt helpless and decided to donate the money he had put together for another trip out to Nepal this year to the Nepal Relief Fund.

However Gareth decided that he wanted to do more for his friends and the people of the village.

He said: “Their friends from the village and families have been absolutely devastated by the earthquake.”

He set up the sponsored walk which spans approximately 26 miles from so that money could be donated to ‘Lincs2nepal’, a charity that will offer immediate help to the thousands of people who are still living in their ruined towns and villages.

The Portland man said: “I only came up with the idea two or three days ago, I thought ‘what can I do?’

“May 23 is my birthday, so rather than go out for it, I’m going to do something worthwhile.”

Two of his colleagues from DCH, Richard Stone and Dane Francis both from the Dorset area said that they would get involved in the fundraising event too.

Gareth is appealing for others to join in the sponsored walk as well.

“The more people that get involved, the more donations we can get.” He said.

You can support Gareth and the other walkers on May 23 by going to the Just Giving website and searching for GJ Davies.
