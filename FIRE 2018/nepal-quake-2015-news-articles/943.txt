How Would Bill Clinton Run Against Hillary Clinton?

NBC News ^ | JAMES NOVOGROD, RICHARD ENGEL AND CASSANDRA VINOGRAD

A major aftershock hit the Kathmandu area of Nepal on Sunday, terrifying locals as rescuers dug for survivors of a devastating earthquake which left more than 2,500 people dead.

The United States Geological Survey said the tremor registered an initial 6.7 magnitude  compared with Saturday's 7.8 magnitude quake.

The aftershock sparked screams and sent terrified people into the streets of Kathmandu. At the city's airport, the floor rolled with the tremor. Passengers rushed past the immigration desks and customs officials abandoned their seats, rushing to take cover along a row of pillars as the building shook and lights briefly went out.

On Mount Everest  where an avalanche triggered by Saturday's quake killed at least 17 people  climbers reported further avalanches.

Nepal authorities said Sunday that at least 2,430 people in that country had died in Nepal alone, not including the 18 people that the Nepal Mountaineering Association says died in an earthquake-triggered avalanche on Mount Everest, according to the Associated Press. Another 61 people died from the quake in India and a few in other neighboring countries.

At least three U.S. citizens were confirmed dead, according to a State Department official. The official declined to comment further "out of respect for the privacy of those affected."

After thousands of people slept in the open air in Nepal, rescuers dug with their bare hands on Sunday morning to continue searching for survivors and bodies. Police officer Sudan Shreshtha said his team had brought 166 corpses overnight to one hospital in Kathmandu.

"I am tired and exhausted, but I have to work and have the strength," Shreshtha told Reuters as an ambulance brought three more victims to the Tribhuvan University Teaching Hospital.

Thousands of people were gathered near the Tudikhel Parade Ground, some with tents while others lay on blankets in the large grassy area.

"I've never seen this situation in my life," said Subhas, who had spent the night there. "It's totally horrible."

Subhas, 30, told NBC News he did not know if his rental home was still standing.

Fifteen-year-old student Soro was also staying at the parade ground with his family and described how his family's apartment shook "horizontally and vertically" when the quake hit. He said two of his aunts were hospitalized with scrapes but the rest of his family was uninjured.

"Yesterday was a catastrophe," Subhas added.

As aid started flowing into Nepal, Save the Children said on Twitter that its teams on the ground "found the overall situation to have been worse than their worst fears."

Several nations have pledged to send help to devastated Nepal. The U.S. pledged an initial $1 million in humanitarian aid, and on Sunday deployed a Military C-17 Globemaster aircraft carrying 70 personnel, including a response team, a search and rescue team and journalists. The plane, which is also carrying 45 square tons of cargo, is expected to arrive in Nepal on Monday, said Pentagon spokesman Col. Steve Warren.

The European Union said it is ready to support an international aid effort, and Pakistan said it would send doctors, hospital equipment and search and rescue teams. China is sending a 62-member search and rescue team and six dogs, which should arrive Sunday afternoon, state-run media Xinhua reported.

Indian air force planes landed Sunday with 43 tons of relief material, including tents and food, and nearly 200 rescuers, according to India's External Affairs Ministry spokesman Vikas Swarup. India's prime minister said that a high-level meeting on Sunday would be held to discuss further aid efforts.

Rescue helicopters also managed to make it to Mount Everest to airlift some of the badly-wounded off the world's highest peak. Officials confirmed 17 bodies had been recovered there  and more than 60 people were injured in the avalanche on what is believed to have been the deadliest day ever recorded on the world's tallest mountain.

It’s a bit subtle... Bill running against (from) Hellary! would be like an earthquake AND avalanche combined.
