WHITSUNDAY locals and McDonald's licensees Michael and Jane Muller are doing their bit to aid the earthquake recovery in Nepal.

The couple have decided to send this month's money box donations from their Bowen, Cannonvale and Airlie Beach stores to Forget Me Not, a charity supporting Nepal's vulnerable children.

"Not a cent goes anywhere else," Mrs Muller said.

"The money will go directly to the Forget Me Not House."

Mrs Muller said the money would be used to help rebuild the charity's transit home in Kathmandu and its schooling facilities.

However, the most important task for Forget Me Not staff isn't rebuilding just yet.

"There's one little girl still missing," Mrs Muller said.

Charity workers are searching for Rasuwa and her family, the last Forget Me Not sponsored child unaccounted for.

Mr Muller said he hoped the fundraiser would attract significant donations.

"I envisage that on a normal month we probably raise around $1200 to $1500 out of all the boxes in all three of our stores, and I'd really like to say that we could push that up to $2000 this month," he said.

Donations can also be made at forgetmenot.org.au/nepal-earthquake/ or by searching Forget Me Not House.

Forget Me Not works in Nepal to reconnect lost and vulnerable children with their families.
