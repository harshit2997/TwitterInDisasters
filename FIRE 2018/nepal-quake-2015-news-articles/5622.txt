Nepal walks the diplomatic tightrope
</headline>

It sits on an earthquake fault line but authorities have shown an alarming lack of preparedness

The sad loss of lives in the earthquake that struck across three countries — Nepal, India and Bangladesh — has resurrected geopolitical sensitivities across the region. Even as the world scrambles to send aid to the victims of the catastrophe in Nepal, the administration there finds itself in a stressful position diplomatically. In an overt sign of deference to China, Nepal rejected assistance from Taiwan. But it is not alone. The US in sending its condolences to the families who lost their loved ones across India, Bangladesh and Nepal pointedly ignored the victims in Tibet.

China and India, meanwhile, have pulled out all stops to assist Kathmandu because it is in their interests — politically, militarily and economically — to do so. But then, Indian relief planes were stopped from flying over parts of Nepal that border China because a key ally had to be kept happy. The government of Nepal has been forced to flip flop on matters of diplomacy even during its worst hour. More importantly, Nepal has been found wanting — while walking the diplomatic tightrope — in providing speedy and effective relief to its people.

Nepal is on an earthquake fault line but the authorities, showing alarming lack of anticipation and preparedness, have fallen short of people’s expectations. It does not help to be one of the world’s poorest countries, but it will also not help Kathmandu in the long run to taint humanitarian aid with a geopolitical brush. Such an approach will only make matters worse for stricken Nepalis, who are crying out for aid.
