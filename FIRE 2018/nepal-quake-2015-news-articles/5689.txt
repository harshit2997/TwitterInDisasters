The Province of British Columbia is sending a substantial amount of funding to Nepal to assist the devastated nation.

B.C. is providing the Canadian Red Cross with $300,000 in relief efforts following the destructive 7.8 magnitude earthquake plagued the small nation on Saturday, April 25th.

The much needed funding will provide communities throughout the country’s worst-hit areas to help support search and rescue operations, food distribution, and the delivery of aids such as blankets, hygiene kits, and sleeping mats.

In addition, BC Liquor Stores will be collecting donations for earthquake relief efforts. Citizens can donate at any of the 196 BC Liquor Stores throughout the province while they’re going through the checkout.

Lastly, as part of provincial response efforts, the Medical Services Commission will be waiving the regular three-month waiting period for Medical Services Plan benefits for Canadians who are returning to British Columbia from Nepal to ensure they receive immediate medical care.

"We know, from our own emergency efforts here at home, that every day and every dollar counts. We're all in this together - with the same hope that we will be able to help save lives and provide the people of Nepal with the support they need to get through this disaster,” said Attorney General and Minister of Justice Suzanne Anton.

"Our hearts go out to the people of Nepal as they cope with this devastating earthquake. Our sincere thanks to the Province of B.C. for its leadership and support. We also wish to thank the BC Liquor Distribution Branch and its customers donating through BC Liquor Stores. These contributions from people across B.C. will be vital to the emergency response and recovery operation,” added Kimberley Nemrava, B.C.-Yukon director, Canadian Red Cross.
