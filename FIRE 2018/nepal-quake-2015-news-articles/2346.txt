A Farnham family, who live in Nepal, have survived the devastating earthquake.



Mum Jude Collins and her two children, aged 11 and eight, are now living in a tent, as they are scared to return to their home.

They believe it may have been destroyed.

The family moved to Nepal three years ago to work with UK development charity TearFund, who are fundraising to support the relief effort out there.

Judeâ€™s husband Steve, 46, flew out to Dubai on the morning of the disaster. He is now desperately trying to get back to his family.

Speaking from Nepal's capital Kathmandu, Jude said:

"For the majority of people they're looking at situations where they're not going a great deal of access to good water.

They're going to find as the shops are closing, they're not going to have enough food.

People are camping outside and it's getting quite cold on a night time."



Aftershocks keep rippling through the country and the death toll is rising. The earthquake hit with a magnitude of 7.9.

This morning the number stands over 3,600 men, women and children killed.

10 Hampshire firefighters have joined UK search and rescue teams in Kathmandu.

They flew out last night (26th April), the earthquake ripped through on Saturday (25th April).

This afternoon (27th April), North Camp Methodist Church is inviting people to light a candle in memory of the people who have already lost their lives.

David Betts from Aldershot Garrison told Eagle:

"We want to allow this time to think our friends in the local Nepalese community who will have lost friends and loved ones.

We have chosen this time so it fits in with the end of a school day and would particularly welcome families to visit straight after school.

We hope to have a condolence book that we will later pass on to our Nepalese community leaders."

The Foreign Office has advised that any British Nationals in need of consular assistance call +44 (0) 207 008 0000 or text NEPAL to +447860010026.
