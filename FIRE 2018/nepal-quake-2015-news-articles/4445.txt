</headline>

<text>
Taipei, April 30 (CNA) The government and non-government sectors in Taiwan are very willing to help with the humanitarian efforts in the wake of the magnitude-7.8 earthquake in Nepal that left more than 5,000 people dead and 10,000 injured, Premier Mao Chi-kuo (毛治國) said Thursday.



Speaking during a weekly Cabinet meeting, Mao said the Ministry of Health and Welfare (MOHW) and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) has sent an advance team to Nepal to assess the need for medical assistance, while aid and supplies provided by Taiwan's non-government sector have been arriving in the Himalayan country in recent days.



Also, the MOFA has donated US$300,000 to Nepal on behalf of the government, while the MOHW has set up three accounts to accept donations from the public, he said.



According to the MOFA, medical teams from the Taiwan International Health Action, the Buddhist Compassion Relief Tzu Chi Foundation, Taiwan's Red Cross Society and the Buddha's Light International Association have arrived in the Nepalese capital of Kathmandu.



The first batch of relief supplies was shipped from Taiwan April 28, and the government is exploring the possibility of shipping more supplies via chartered planes operated by DHL and FedEX, the MOFA said.



It said the government has also made a request to the American Institute in Taiwan to cooperate with the United States in shipping supplies to Nepal.



As of 6 p.m. April 28, the three accounts set up by the MOHW had received cash donations totaling NT$3 million, the MOFA said.



Cabinet spokesman Sun Lih-chyun (孫立群), meanwhile, said that despite previously turning down Taiwan's offer to help with search and rescue efforts, the Nepalese government has changed its mind and has said it is willing to consider Taiwan's offer.



The MOFA has requested the National Fire Agency to organize a search and rescue team, he said.
