</headline>

<text>
KATHMANDU – The Executive Director of the United Nations World Food Programme (WFP), Ertharin Cousin, is travelling to Nepal today to see at first hand WFP’s operation to assist hundreds of thousands of survivors of the devastating earthquake that hit the country on 25 April.

While in Nepal, Cousin will meet with government officials and humanitarians involved in the relief effort. She will travel to remote locations where WFP is delivering food.

The visit comes after WFP issued an urgent appeal for US$116.5 million to provide food for 1.4 million people over the next three months. WFP, which is funded entirely by contributions from governments, companies and individuals, also needs an additional US$34 million to provide common logistics and telecommunications services for the humanitarian community. An online appeal has been launched at www.wfp.org/nepal .
