The Non-Resident Nepali Association has said that it has collected money from 300 people as part of the second stage of its fundraising campaign for quake victims in Nepal. The money will be sent to the Nepal Prime Minister's Relief Fund by Friday.

Blue collar workers too have come forward with their contributions. Deepak Shresthra, first vice president of NRNA said, “Both blue collar and white collar workers have donated for the cause. We visited seven [labour] camps to collect money from Nepalese workers. ”

While most of the donations received ranged between RO1 to RO50, the highest was RO400, he said adding, the first part of this collection will be sent to the Prime Minister's Relief Fund by Friday.

“Besides Nepalis, Indians, Pakistanis, Bangladeshis, Sri Lankans and Filipinos have also donated for the disaster-struck country,” Shresthra said. Besides NRNA, there are also volunteers in the sultanate who are working to help those in Nepal.

Tushar Vyas, one such volunteer, has been collecting materials such as medicines, food, blankets and clothes after getting the required approval from relevant bodies in Oman. Vyas said he is also in touch with the Nepal Embassy for sending the relief materials.

“We have also approached Oman Air to help us transport the items to Nepal. We have collected medicines, food and clothes for quake victims. I am sure at this stage these things will be of great help to the victims,” he said.

The Embassy of Nepal in Muscat has also released a notice providing account numbers of six banks in Kathmandu for people to contribute. According to the notice, the assistance “can be deposited in the embassy, or, alternately it can be directly sent to the bank accounts”.
