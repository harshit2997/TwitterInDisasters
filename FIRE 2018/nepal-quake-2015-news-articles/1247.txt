Nepal earthquake: 349 Australians 'unaccounted for'
</headline>

<text>
The federal government is sending a crisis response team to Nepal to confirm the safety of 349 Australians who have not been accounted for after a massive earthquake hit the country.

A total of 549 Australians are registered as being in Nepal at present, with the safety of just 200 having been confirmed so far, according to Foreign Minister Julie Bishop.

"While there are reports of extensive loss of life, at this point there are no reports of Australian deaths," Ms Bishop, who is en route back to Australia from Europe, said in a statement.

"[The] Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade has opened its Emergency Call Unit and has updated the travel advice for Nepal. It notes disruptions to telecommunications, transport and tourist infrastructure, and advises Australians to follow the instructions of local authorities.

"I urge Australians concerned for the welfare of family and friends in Nepal to attempt to contact them directly.

"An Australian Crisis Response Team will travel to Nepal as soon as possible to assist in establishing the welfare of Australians unaccounted for after the earthquake on 25 April. Two humanitarian experts will also be deployed."

Ms Bishop said the Australian embassy in Kathmandu was working closely with Nepalese authorities and international donors to assess the full extent of the disaster.

An initial $5 million in assistance will also be offered to Nepal in the wake of the tragic earthquake that has killed more than 1800 people, she said.

The $5 million assistance includes $2.5 million to assist Australian non-government organisations, $2 million to support United Nations partners and $500,000 to support the Australian Red Cross.

Labor foreign affairs spokeswoman Tanya Plibersek urged the federal government to provide assistance to the affected countries.

"There are reports already of health services running out of some types of medicines and medical supplies. Obviously we support Australia providing any assistance in that area in logistics or any of the capacities that we have to help after such an immense natural disaster," she said.

"There have been reports that we are sending logistics teams and other support, that's a very good first step.

"Many Australians have visited Nepal over the years, many have a strong affection for the country and we should of course do whatever we can to assist Nepal, India and Bangladesh, all of them affected by this terrible natural disaster."

In a statement on its website, DFAT said the epicentre of the earthquake was 80 kilometres west of Kathmandu and had caused extensive damage to buildings in cities including Kathmandu and Pokhara.

"A large number of deaths and injuries have been reported. Aftershocks are expected. Travellers should expect disruption to telecommunications, transport and tourist infrastructure in affected areas," the statement said.

Kathmandu's international airport remains open, but flights have been disrupted.

Australians in Nepal in need of consular assistance may contact the Australian Embassy in Kathmandu on (+977 1) 437 1678 or the Consular Emergency Centre in Canberra on (+61 2) 6261 3305.
