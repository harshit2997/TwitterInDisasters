Guwahati: For these five families from the Hengrabari locality of the city, the decision to make a change in travel plan will not be easy from now after they lost one member each, all women, in the devastating earthquake in Nepal. Oblivious of the fact what cruel fate had in store for them, all of them died after advancing their trip by a day.However, three other families from the same locality were lucky enough to survive the wrath of nature.A total of 26 pilgrims from the city were supposed to begin their pilgrimage to Pashupatinath and other temples this week. Out of the 26 pilgrims, eight hailed from the Hengrabari locality alone. The group of eight pilgrims from the Henegrabari locality was supposed to travel to Nepal on April 24. But due to reasons unknown, their time schedule was advanced by 24 hours and they boarded the train to Siliguri on April 23 instead of April 24.On Monday, as the news poured in that five pilgrims from that locality were confirmed dead, a pall of gloom descended on the affected households in that locality.Nabanita Das, daughter of Rina Das whose mother was one of the five deceased, said Thursday (April 23) was an inauspicious day to travel and twist of fate did play its part. "If the group had begun their travel on April 24 either they would have been stranded somewhere else or their train would have been delayed by some hours. But destiny is cruel," said Nabanita.Utpal Majumdar, son of Padma Majumdar, agreed that a slight change in his mother's time schedule would have made all the difference. "I do not know why the ticket was advanced. It's hard to accept my my mother's fate," added Utpal.But the family of MC Nath, one of the three pilgrims who survived, all is not lost. Nath had just stepped out of the hotel when the quake brought down the building. "My father is on his way to Guwahati. He managed to contact another fellow neighbour who was in the group. I was worried about him," said Trishna Devi, daughter of Nath.
