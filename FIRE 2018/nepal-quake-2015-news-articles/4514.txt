Huntsville group creates fundraiser for Nepal earthquake victims - WAFF-TV: News, Weather and Sports for Huntsville, AL

The earthquake in Nepal has impacted lots of people here in the Tennessee Valley.

A group of Huntsville residents with family in Nepal set up a fundraiser to help get aid to their loved ones.

They set up a fundraiser through Global Giving. They picked that charity specifically because the charity actually gives the highest percentage of donations to the people needing aid and have an excellent review on CharityNavigator.org.

After the earthquake hit, it took them hours to find out if their families were okay.

Luckily, everyone in their family survived - but they have a long road ahead.

"Oh, it's chaotic, it's chaotic," Rosi Rajbhandari said. "I actually just got a text from my sister this morning and she said it started to smell like dead bodies - they haven't been able to pull out everyone yet, so the smell is starting to come way they are now."
