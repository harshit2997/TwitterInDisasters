</headline>

<text>
In addition to the ten-member Korea Disaster Response Team currently working in Nepal, the South Korean government has decided to send another 44 emergency workers to the South Asian country.



The government on Wednesday decided to increase its support to the quake-ravaged country, adding more medical personnel to the initial plan.



On Friday, another batch of 15 search and rescue workers, 15 medical personnel and 2 staff will be dispatched to Nepal. The rescue workers will work at Bhaktapur, some 15 kilometers east of Kathmandu, and the medical team will be stationed at the Nepal-Korea Friendship Hospital in Thimi.



Another 12-member team will be sent after the second batch returns to Korea after concluding its ten-day mission.
