SINGAPORE: The Singapore Red Cross (SRC) will send S$50,000 worth of relief items and emergency supplies to earthquake-hit Nepal, it announced in a news release on Sunday (Apr 26).

It is also launching an urgent public appeal for funds for relief and recovery efforts. The Government on Saturday announced a donation of S$100,000 as seed money for its fundraising efforts.

The Singapore Red Cross office is operating extended hours to receive walk-in donors from Monday. Members of the public can drop off donations at Red Cross House, 15 Penang Lane, Singapore 236486, from 9am to 7.45pm on Mondays to Fridays and 10am to 3pm on Saturdays, Sundays and public holidays.

Those who wish to donate can also write a cheque payable to Singapore Red Cross Society with an indication that it is for the Nepal Earthquake Relief Fund on the back of the cheque, SRC said on Monday. Online donations can be made via SG Gives at www.sggives.org/nepalsrcs, it said.

SRC also said in-kind donations such as food, clothes and medicine are not accepted due to logistical considerations. Donations to overseas relief are not entitled to tax deductions, it added.

“We are appealing to the Singapore public to help the affected people as they mourn their loss and begin to rebuild their lives. The Singapore Red Cross will channel the funds collected towards acute emergency relief and recovery assistance for the affected communities and the people who have lost homes and livelihoods,” said secretary general of SRC, Benjamin William.

SRC said it is in constant contact with its Red Cross partners on the ground and closely monitoring the situation in affected areas. It also plans to send disaster response personnel to the affected areas.
