[Anglican Communion News Service] Anglican agencies have renewed appeals for support after a second earthquake hit Nepal causing further death and destruction, the Anglican Alliance reports.

The 7.3 magnitude quake struck around 12.30 p.m. local time on Tuesday, May 12, killing at least 82 people, including 17 in neighboring India and one in Chinese Tibet. It came on the heels of the 8.1 magnitude quake on April 25 in which some 7,700 died.

“The [first] quake has claimed more than 7,000 lives, and many more thousands injured. We have lost many members, including a dear pastor, [Laxman Tamang],” said the Rev. Lewis Lew, Anglican dean of Nepal.

Eighteen Anglican church buildings had been destroyed, as well as more than 8,000 homes in the communities where the church was present, according to Lew, who underlined the need for emergency assistance: “More than 30,000 in these affected areas are displaced. Many are still needing temporary shelters, food supplies and medical aids.”

Since the first earthquake, the Anglican Alliance has kept in close touch with the Deanery of Nepal and with the various relief and development agencies around the Anglican Communion. Many, including Episcopal Relief & Development, launched appeals immediately following the first earthquake and are continuing to fund emergency assistance to meet urgent needs for food, clean water and shelter.

A first medical response team was to travel to the disaster area May 6-11, said ACROSS, a crisis relief ministry under the Diocesan Mission Board of The Diocese of Singapore.

According to Anglican Overseas Aid, ACT Alliance partners have distributed tarpaulins, hygiene kits and ready-made food to families in Kathmandu and are assessing the situation in remote communities, with the aim of providing water, sanitation and hygiene materials, as well as emergency shelter to people who lost their homes or who are staying outside for fear of aftershocks.

Local clergy, pastors and church leaders gathered in Kathmandu on May 11 for a time of prayer and encouragement. “This will be an important time for the Anglican Church in Nepal, and we need your prayers, for myself and the clergy team from Singapore, as we stand together with our brethren,” said Lew.
