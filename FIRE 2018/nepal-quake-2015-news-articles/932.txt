SEATTLE - A Nepal police official says at least 1,910 people have been killed, including at least 721 in Kathmandu, in the immense weekend earthquake centered outside of the capital of the Himalayan nation.

Deputy Inspector General of Police Komal Singh Bam says the death toll is expected to climb.

“It’s continuously raining and all the houses are destroyed, so they are not even having shelters,” said Raj Shrestha, a UW graduate student. He was on the verge of tears while talking about his home town in Nepal, which was at the epicenter of the 7.8 magnitude earthquake.

Shrestha also recalled the painful conversations he had with friends and family early Saturday.

“It was heartbreaking to talk to them, because the small kids are crying in the background of the phone!” he said.

Shrestha was at a meeting set up by the Nepalese Student Association to discuss the best way to help their loved ones deal with the aftermath of the quake. They discussed fundraising and donating blood.

The earthquake also devastated the climbing community around Mount Everest. The base camp was hit by an avalanche and falling rock when the earth shook. At least 17 died on the mountain -- including field medic Marisa Eve Girawong, employed by Seattle-based Madison Mountaineering.

“She was very vibrant and youthful and well-liked by the team and staff,” Kurt Hunter with Madison said.
