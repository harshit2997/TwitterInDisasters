A 13-member team of doctors, associated with the Indian Medical Association, on Wednesday returned from its humanitarian expedition to quake-hit Nepal. The team has spent seven days in Nepalese capital Kathmandu, treating about 800 patients with various complaints.

The IMA team has returned in compliance with Nepal government orders. The Nepalese ministry of health and population has asked foreign medical teams to go back to their countries.

At present, over 120 foreign medical teams are active in Kathmandu and other places.

Speaking with dna, Dr Guna Raj Lohani, chief, curative service division, Nepalese ministry of health and population, said, "Most of our patients have got medical aid and the number of cases remaining is manageable. It's a very great thing that in our time of difficulty, all countries came ahead and helped us. We are really thankful to them. Now the foreign medical teams can go back to their countries. If we need any kind of help in future, definitely we will contact them."

Meanwhile, World Health Organisation (WHO) has set up mobile mental health clinics to treat patients in and around Kathmandu, and will shortly extend help to more remote affected districts. People from Nepal are also grappling with a rise in mental health disorders triggered by the disaster.
