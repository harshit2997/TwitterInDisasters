Valour holds yard sale for Nepal quake victims

PETAWAWA -

Supporters of Phil Sheppard held a fundraiser last Saturday in hopes of boosting the Pembroke physiotherapist's humanitarian efforts in earthquake stricken Nepal.

A day-long yard sale at Valour K-12 School raked in close to $4,000. This last-minute event managed to attract 14 vendors with everything to sell from books and DVD's to toys, clothes and baked goods.

The organizer was Haley Sheppard who immediately wanted to help her brother, who was in Nepal on April 25 when the magnitude 7.8 temblor struck. He immediately went to work at a hospital in Pokhara, Nepal's second-largest city, and has remained behind to co-ordinate the delivery of aid and medicine to quake victims primarily in the isolated villages around the mountainous Central Asian nation.

When she heard about his plan to help the people of Nepal, Sheppard said she had to act not only to raise funds but awareness that the crisis is not over. Certainly residents heard the call and flocked to the new school to do their part.

“It was incredible,” said Sheppard, a teacher at Valour. “I can't believe how many people came out.”

The death toll from the quake has been estimated at 8,000 people with another 14,500 injured. More than 4,000 aid workers from around the world have been helping with relief and rescue operations. Canada has deployed the Disaster Assistance Response Team, including personnel from Garrison Petawawa, to the region and committed $5 million in humanitarian assistance funding in response to an appeal launched by the United Nations.

Sheppard said she has heard from Phil, who was aware of the yard sale and is very proud of the generosity on the home front.

“He's doing better,” she said. “It was pretty rough for the first couple of weeks.”

Joining Sheppard in co-ordinating the fundraiser was fellow teacher Kayla Gilchrist. Sporting the Valour green t-shirt, Gilchrist and several other volunteers eagerly manned the tables as folks looked over items and didn't mind parting with a few dollars to help total strangers living on the other side of the world.

“This is a great way to bring the community together to help out a cause that is far away,” said Gilchrist.

The school will hold another benefit later in the month where classes will compete to see who can raise the most money with the winner receiving a pizza and ice cream cake party.
