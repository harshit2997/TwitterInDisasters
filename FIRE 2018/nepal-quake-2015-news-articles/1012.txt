Nepal earthquake: Mount Everest climbers killed as quake triggers avalanche
</headline>

A year after a deadly avalanche on Mount Everest ended the climbing season, another avalanche, this one caused by a powerful earthquake near the Nepalese capital, rumbled down a treacherous icefall Saturday and slammed into part of the mountaineering base camp, killing at least 17 climbers and injuring at least 37 others, Nepalese officials said.

One of those killed at the base camp was Dan Fredinburg, a Google engineer and avid climber who had sought to take the companys Street View project to the worlds highest mountains. Sadly, we lost one of our own, Google said in a statement.

Alex Gavan, a hiker at the base camp, described on Twitter a "huge earthquake then huge avalanche" that sent him "running for life from my tent." Gavan warned that many of the injured would die if they were not evacuated soon.

Nima Namgyal Sherpa, a tour guide also at the base camp, described the avalanche Saturday as "huge," and said it had caused many injuries.
