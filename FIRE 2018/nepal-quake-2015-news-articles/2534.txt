SEATTLE - A husband and wife from the Bellingham area are among those missing after this weekend's earthquake in Nepal.

Quick Facts:

Doreen Richmond and Jim Lane missing in Nepal quake zone

7.8 earthquake hit Saturday

More than 3,800 dead

Quake hit about 50 miles west of Kathmandu

Currently than 3,800 people are confirmed dead.

The 7.8 magnitude quake hit about 50 miles west of Kathmandu Saturday.

Whatcom County couple, Doreen Richmond and Jim Lane, who have been married for 25 years, were spending months trekking through Nepal when the quake hit.

Doreen's sister in New York posted on Facebook that no one has heard from the pair yet.

KIRO 7 is reaching out to her Monday morning to learn more about them.

Meanwhile, things are starting to get desperate for the hundreds of climbers trapped toward the top of Mount Everest.

More help from Seattle is headed to Nepal Monday.

World Vision, which is a Federal Way-based charity that focuses on helping children worldwide, is sending two staff members to Nepal.

They will leave Seattle Monday shortly before 6 p.m.

Help is also on the way for people with Seattle-based climbing outfitters, which were either at base camp or mid-climb when the earthquake caused a massive avalanche that killed more than a dozen on the mountain.

One was a doctor from New Jersey with Seattle's Madison Mountaineering.

Others are stuck above base camp. They say their plan is to climb down Monday and then wait to be helicoptered out, although the choppers can only carry two stranded climbers at a time.

The disaster comes a year after another devastating event on Everest.

“We had a horrific avalanche off the northwest shoulder of Everest into the ice fall that claimed the lives of 16 Sherpa, including three from our own staff,” said Kurt Hunter with Madison Mountaineering.
