New Delhi: All Lok Sabha members, who have agreed to donate a month's salary towards relief work for those hit by the quake in Nepal and India, were on Tuesday asked to contribute the money to the Prime Minister's Relief Fund.

Parliamentary Affairs Minister M Venkaiah Naidu said all members would donate a month's salary for relief work. Since everybody has agreed to it, there is no need for a resolution to be adopted by the House, he said.

"I will write to all the members (with regard to donating their salary)," Naidu said in the House.

The month's salary needed to be contributed to the Prime Minister's Relief Fund as the money would be sent to a foreign country, he added.

A 7.9-magnitude earthquake jolted Nepal on Saturday, which was followed by several aftershocks that left a trail of death and destruction. There have been loss of lives in some parts of India.

In Nepal, the death toll in the quake has climbed to more than 4,000.
