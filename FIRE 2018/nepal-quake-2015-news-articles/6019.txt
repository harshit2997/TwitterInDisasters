Efforts to step up pace of aid delivery hampered by shortage of supply trucks, drivers

KATHMANDU — The death toll from last Saturday’s massive earthquake in Nepal has risen to 6,250, with 14,357 injured, as Nepali and foreign officials yesterday struggled to locate thousands of people still missing.

There is no number for the missing, but bodies are still being pulled from the debris of ruined buildings, while rescue workers have not been able to reach some remote areas.

Up to 1,000 Europeans are among the missing, mostly around popular trekking routes, the head of the European Union delegation in Nepal said.

“We don’t know where they are or where they could be,” Ambassador Rensje Teerink told reporters.

Officials said it was hard to trace the missing because many backpackers do not register with their embassies in the country.

In Kathmandu, many unclaimed bodies were being quickly cremated due to pressure on mortuaries. Besides the possibility of disease, the stench of the corpses was spreading through localities where buildings had collapsed.

Many bodies could be migrant workers from neighbouring India, who would be living alone in the Himalayan nation, local officials said.

“Morgues are full beyond capacity and we have been given instruction to incinerate bodies immediately after they are pulled out,” said Mr Raman Lal, an Indian paramilitary force official working in coordination with Nepali forces.

Aid was beginning to slowly reach remote towns and villages nestled in the mountains and foothills of the impoverished nation. But government officials said efforts to step up the pace of delivery were frustrated by a shortage of supply trucks and drivers, many of whom had returned to their villages to help their families.

“Our granaries are full and we have ample food stock, but we are not being able to transport supplies at a faster pace,” said Mr Shrimani Raj Khanal, a manager at the Nepal Food Corp.
