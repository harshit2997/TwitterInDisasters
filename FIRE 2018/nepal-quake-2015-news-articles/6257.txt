From Christchurch to Nepal: Uni student helps quake recovery
</headline>

<text>
A Canterbury University student who led earthquake recovery efforts in Christchurch is heading to help in Nepal following Tuesday's quake.

Sam Johnson, leader of the Student Volunteer army in 2011, said he was returning to the devastated country to help rebuild school classrooms in remote Himalayan villages.

"The concern from the village locals is that if we don't get schools operating again soon, students may stop their education.

The village people desperately want to get their children back into school but at the moment buildings are just not safe to enter."

Mr Johnson said he was planning to work with local aid groups on the ground when he returned.

"We are working with a strong team of 50 youth called Rise Nepal and we partner a number of organisations and a local tent manufacturer.

We are developing plans to rebuild village schools in more remote areas using expertise from university professors and aid responders in Christchurch and Kathmandu."

Mr Johnson has asked for other students to join him in Nepal when he heads over in the coming weeks.
