Facebook, Google and the International Committee of the Red Cross have avenues for people worldwide to look for friends and relatives, or get alerts that they are safe, in the wake of the massive earthquake in Nepal on Saturday (Apr 25).

SINGAPORE: Following the 7.8-magnitude earthquake that devastated large parts of Nepal on Saturday (Apr 25), several services have been made available to help people get in touch with their loved ones who may have been in the disaster area.

The International Committee of the Red Cross has set up a page for its Restoring Family Links service for the Nepal earthquake at familylinks.icrc.org/nepal-earthquake. Those who are in Nepal and who have been unable to contact relatives directly can add themselves to a list to say they are alive. Those who have lost contact with a loved one in Nepal can also register that person via the website.

Facebook has turned on its Safety Check feature for people in the disaster zone to mark themselves as "safe". "If you're in one of the areas affected by the earthquake, you'll get a notification asking if you're safe, and whether you want to check on any of your friends," wrote Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg.

Internet search giant Google has also activated its Person Finder. As of noon Sunday, it was tracking close to 3,000 records. The search service is available through SMS in India and the US at the following numbers:

Text "search <name>" to +91-9773300000 in India or +1-650-800-3978 in the US.

Mobile application Viber announced on its Twitter account on Sunday that it would be turning off billing for its calling service, Viber Out, for users in Nepal. This is so those in Nepal can call any destination for free.

The company added that it is working on providing free Viber Out calls to Nepal, and would update users through Twitter.
