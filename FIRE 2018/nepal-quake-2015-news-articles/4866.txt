"I would like to extend my sincere thanks and gratitude to the people of China . . . for the support that we have got here in this difficult time of natural calamities," President Yadav said.



The Nepalese leader also commended the work done by the Chinese quake-relief teams and expressed hope that their government would continue to cooperate and coordinate with the Chinese government in times of disaster and calamities.



According to the report, China sent a 62-member Chinese search and rescue team to Nepal immediately following the devastating 7.9-magnitude quake. The Chinese search and rescue team was among the first to reach quake-hit areas in Nepal.



More teams from Chinese governmental and civil organizations followed, which brought the much-needed life-saving equipment and materials as well as relief supplies, the report added.



Further, China has set aside two rounds of humanitarian aid for Nepal worth 60 million yuan ($9.7 million) as of May 1, Friday.



Wu Chuntai, Chinese ambassador to Nepal, said that China has already sent more than 350 engineers, medical doctors and rescue workers who are now working to assist Nepal in life-saving and help the country recover from the ravages of the disaster.



Wu added that the Chinese government and the Chinese people will stay by Nepal's aid in this time of great difficulties.



Nepal's Ministry of Home Affairs reported that the death toll from the devastating earthquake has already reached 6,250 while 14,357 people were reportedly injured.
