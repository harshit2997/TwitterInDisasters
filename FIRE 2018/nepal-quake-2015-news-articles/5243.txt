Myanmar sends aid to Nepal
</headline>

<text>
Myanmar’s government has moved swiftly to deliver aid to Nepal, now struggling to recover from its worst earthquake in almost a century. Messages of support and condolence from the government of President U Thein Sein to Nepal’s leaders, President Ram Baran Yadav and Prime Minister Sushil Koirala, have been delayed by technological disruptions, according to Nepal’s ambassador to Myanmar, Paras Ghimire.

Foreign ministry officials said two cargo planes flew from Myanmar to Kathmandu on May 1 and 2 carrying emergency supplies, including drinking water, food and clothing.

The planes ferried back several Myanmar nationals, including one injured in the quake, said U Kyaw Zayya, deputy director general of the ministry’s political affairs department.

Myanmar’s support for devastated Nepal comes from the grassroots as well as the governmental level. In an appeal sent to The Myanmar Times, Mr Ghimire urged “one and all and the friends of Nepal” to give liberally – a plea many ordinary citizens have heeded. Fundraisers, who organised a candlelight vigil at Shwedagon Pagoda, have reportedly helped raise at least 5 million Nepalese rupees (about US$50,000) and an additional $50,000.

In the rankings published recently by the 2014 World Giving Index, Myanmar ranked first along with the United States for willingness to give to, and volunteer for, charity.

The generous outpouring of both official and unofficial aid and sympathy from Myanmar for a stricken near-neighbour may have been prompted in part by still-fresh memories of the disaster inflicted by Cyclone Nargis seven years ago this month.

Many believe the protracted reluctance on the part of the former military regime to accept foreign aid served to underline the urgent need for reforms.

At least 7675 people were killed and 16,000 injured in the 7.8-magnitude earthquake that struck Nepal on April 25. Mr Ghimire said donations would be deposited in the Prime Minister’s Disaster Relief Fund.

As search-and-rescue teams begin to withdraw, the ambassador said there was still a need for tents, tarpaulins, blankets and torches, as well as longer-term aid.

The ambassador has invited those wishing to donate to visit the embassy at 16 Natmauk Yeikthar Street in Yangon.
