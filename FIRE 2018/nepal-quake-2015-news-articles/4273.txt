Dubai: Eight members of the Gulf For Good (G4G) charity trek to the Everest Base Camp arrived in Dubai from quake-hit Nepal on Thursday night.

The group was reunited family and friends and met with a hero’s welcome at the Terminal 2 of Dubai International Airport.

Tricia Evans, Strategy Governor, Gulf for Good, said out of the nine challengers, the eight challengers arrived in Dubai at 10.35pm via Fly Dubai FZ 576.

“All the Everest base camp challenge participants are safe. The ninth challenger, Matt Lawson, has decided to stay in Nepal and join the rescue efforts,” Evans told Gulf News.

Those who arrived were British expatriates Anne Edmonson, Gulf for Good Charity Governor; Paul Cracknell, a landscape architect; Martin Hope, a technical director; Lizzy Pudner, a director; Taran Vernon, a registrar; and Indian expatriates Varun Mohan, a student, and Shikha Kanojia, an external auditor.

The challengers were on a 12-day trek to the Everest Base Camp at 5,545 metres when the tragedy happened. They were on their eighth trekking day and was en route to Labouche — Gorak Shep along the Khumbu Glacier when the 7.9 magnitude earthquake struck on Saturday.

The killer quake triggered an avalanche and severely damaged the Everest Base Camp where the team was supposedly headed the next day according to their itinerary. Fortunately, all of them were unharmed.

“G4G team wishes to thank everyone for their wishes and we are glad to have them back.We are incredibly grateful to our ground handlers for managing the safe evacuation of the group in a very difficult situation,” Evans said.

The team aimed to raise funds to support the Eco Children’s Farm Home, a self-sustaining farm and home for up to 45 Nepalese orphans. The charity shared a Project Wish list that “will make a powerful impact to the welfare of the children.”

The trek is G4G’s 50th challenge to date.
