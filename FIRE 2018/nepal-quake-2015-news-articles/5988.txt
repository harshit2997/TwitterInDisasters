A helping hand: Haligonians in Nepal forgo evacuation to help with relief efforts

While many Canadian opted to be evacuated from Nepal following the violent 7.8 magnitude earthquake April 25, six young people travelling from Halifax have decided to stay and help with relief efforts.

Among them are Halifax based DJ duo, JR Loeb and Mitchell Pineo, who were in Kathmandu for a three day tour when the earthquake struck.

After overcoming the initial shock of the situation, Loeb and Pineo, along with their friends, Matthew Simmons, Kenny James, Sophia Hamilton-Clark and Matthew Walters decided to stay and do as much as they could to help out the Nepalese people.

“We are just some healthy Canadians trying to lend a hand and make the best of a terrible situation for the Nepali people,” said Loeb.

Thursday morning, the group watched as a young Nepali boy was pulled from the rubble six days after it initially ravaged the country.

“Miracles can happen,” said Loeb.

While in Kathmandu they have been staying with Nepali Bikrant Shrestha. Since the earthquake Shrestha has been using his home and compound as a makeshift refugee and relief camp.

“Shrestha’s compound fed and sheltered dozens of people in the immediate after math,” said Pineo. “He is leading and organizing the relief effort by supplying the vehicles we are using to get the supplies out of the city, and he owns the building where we are storing all the supplies before they go out.”

In the coming days the group plans to leave Kathmandu and head to a town two hours outside of Kathmandu, which has not yet been reached by aide workers.

“The real problems now are truly out of the city in the smaller villages that are difficult to reach,” said Pineo, “Kathmandu has so many aide workers from around the world now, but it is not all getting where it needs to go.”

In the grand scheme of things, Loeb said that the work they are doing is just a pebble in the sea.

“By no means are we heroes,” he said, “It is the people who are digging people out of rubble or doing mountain rescues that are heroes.”

James said that this situation has been eye opening, and that he has learned a lot from the people of Nepal.

“Their humbleness and generosity has been incredibly touching and essential to helping Nepal recover,” he said.

“Nepalese citizens have set the global standard for humanity."
