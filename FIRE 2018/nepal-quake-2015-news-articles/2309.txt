NEDERLAND – The owners of Kathmandu restaurant say their family in Nepal is safe, though life has changed dramatically for them.

Resham Gurung and Lok Malla both came to Colorado about 25 years ago. The couple found out about the massive earthquake near their hometown Saturday morning.

"We don't know what is going on, and when we start to look at the news, we was freaking out we didn't know what to do," Gurung said.

She said she was able to get in contact with most of her family and all of them are alive, but her childhood home was destroyed.

"My dad is 90 years old and he's on the street," she said. "He cannot go inside the house and it's raining outside on the street and he doesn't have sleeping bag."

The couple is now collecting money at their restaurant to send to Nepal.

Six other employees at the restaurant are from Nepal and Malla said they have been in contact with their families as well. Some of them are in the hospital.
