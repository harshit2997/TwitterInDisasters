Dr. Gary Morsch calls relief effort one of the toughest of his career

A Kansas City-area doctor who has been part of the earthquake relief mission in Nepal said the devastation there is astonishing.

Dr. Gary Morsch of Heart to Heart International returned to Kansas City late Wednesday afternoon.

He said the amount of damage and the difficulty of getting to the people who need help the most makes this assignment one of the toughest of his career. He said some of the worst damage is in remote villages that are the hardest to reach.

Heart to Heart International’s main assignment is to deal with the injured in disasters like the earthquake. Morsch said one father carried his daughter on his shoulders for four hours to get her broken leg set.

He said the main problem right now is getting enough food to the people of Nepal, and it’s not going well.

“They have been eating the seed, the rice seed for their next crop. So there’s a worry they won’t be able to plant,” he said. “Not only are they hungry now, but it’s going to disrupt their entire agricultural system.”

Heart to Heart International has shipped 15 tons of supplies, including 150,000 meals, to the earthquake zone.
