KATHMANDU: The Nepal government urgently needs tents, dry food, mattresses, medicines and other basic essentials for its people who are in dire need of relief and support following Saturday's earthquake.

At a press conference here, Nepal Chief Secretary Leela Mani Paudyal requested India, China and other foreign countries to provide more assistance, Xinhua news agency reported.

Tens of thousands of people in the Himalayan nation continued to spend chilly nights in the open for the past two days and were seeking basic essentials after the devastating earthquake on Saturday and Sundayâ€™s aftershocks.

"We are not able to distribute enough drinking water, dry food, mattresses, and medicines to the earthquake victims in such a difficult situation," the chief secretary said, adding that the government was doing its best to expedite rescue operations.

But he conceded that the government was unable to send rescue teams to remote villages due to the bad weather and difficult topography.

People have been living without electricity for the past two days since the 7.9-magnitude quake jolted the Himalayan nation.

Paudyal said that electricity supply could only be resumed on Tuesday at the earliest.

With communications yet to be restored, the Nepal government is unable to determine the number of houses destroyed in the earthquake and the extent of damage to properties.

"We don't have exact data of damaged houses and properties inside and outside the capital in the earthquake.

"It is our preliminary estimation that the number of houses damaged is 10 times higher than that of deaths and injured people," Paudyal added.

Home ministry spokesman Laxmi Prasad Dhakal said the top priority was to provide rescue operations in 11 badly affected districts including Kathmandu, Bhaktapur and Lalitpur.

The Nepal government on Monday set up five hotlines to hear public grievances and had opened six bank accounts for donations to be channelled to the Prime Minister's Relief Fund. - The Statesman/Asia News Network
