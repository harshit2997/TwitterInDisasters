"One Tree Hill" actress Sophia Bush is left heart-broken after her former boyfriend Dan Fredinburg, a Google executive, was tragically killed after the Nepal earthquake caused a Mount Everest avalanche.



The 32-year-old actress and Fredinburg dated in 2013 before calling it quits in February 2014. In a heartfelt Instagram post, Bush remembered Fredinburg as "one-of-a-kind.



"There are no adequate words. Today I find myself attempting to pick up the pieces of my heart that have broken into such tiny shards, I'll likely never find them all."Today I, and so many of my loved ones, lost an incredible friend. Dan Fredinburg was one-of-a-kind. Fearless. Funny... He was one of my favourite human beings on Earth. He was one of the great loves of my life," Bush posted.The exes clearly remained friends after the split because as Bush revealed she had plans to catch up with Fredinburg after his trek."I was looking forward to our planned download of 'all the things' when he got home. I am crushed that I will never hear that story," she wrote."Please remember that our time on this Earth is not guaranteed. Please tell those you love that you do. Right now. This very minute. And please send a kiss to the sky for my friend Dan. His energy is so big and so bright, and it's all around us, so put some love toward him today. And then hug your loved ones again.
