Prime Minister Sushil Koirala has warned of taking action against anyone involved in irregularities and discrimination in the distribution of relief meant for the earthquake victims.

The Prime Minister said so while receiving Rs 2.5 million in relief assistance that the National Cooperatives Federation Nepal contributed to the Prime Minister Disaster Relief Fund.

"It is a crime to pocket the money meant for the relief of the victims; action would be taken if corruption is committed in the relief, rehabilitation and reconstruction works to be carried out in the quake-affected areas," the PM said on the occasion.

Stating that the Nepalis have the culture of supporting each other even by forgoing meals at times of disaster, PM Koirala appreciated the assistance provided by the Federation and other Nepali organisations with generous heart.

He reiterated that directives have been issued to the bodies concerned to see that fairness is maintained in the relief distribution.

Federation chairman and CA member Keshab Prasad Badal handed over a cheque for that amount to the Prime Minister on the occasion.

A delegation of the Federation including chairman Badal had reached the Prime Minister's official residence at Baluwatar to hand over the amount to the Prime Minister.

It is said relief materials worth Rs 20 million collected and despatched by the Indian Farmers Fertilizers Ltd under the coordination of the Federation have been distributed to the earthquake victims in Gorkha, Sindhupalchok and Kavrepalanchok districts. RSS
