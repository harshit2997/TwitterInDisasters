Cable & Wireless offers free calls home for Nepalese

07-May-2015

Nepalese officials working in the police force and at the Montage Posée prison can contact their loved ones back home for free following the recent earthquake which struck Nepal last week.



This will be possible after locally based telecommunications company Cable & Wireless offered starter packs to enable the Nepalese officials to call their loved ones for free for two weeks, from May 1-15.



Albert Duncan, a representative of Cable & Wireless, handed over the starter packs to the chief superintendent of police, Phillip Cecile, and to the superintendent of prisons, Maxime Tirant, earlier this week at the Cable & Wireless office at Sunshine House, Providence.



Mr Duncan said two weeks free calls will surely benefit all Nepalese working here. He said this will allow them to talk at length with their closest relatives and loved ones, thus putting their minds at rest while they work here.



“We at Cable & Wireless, we are always ready to give a helping hand for those in need. We are giving 120 starter packs to enable easier communication for these people and I take this opportunity to convey to the Nepalese communities affected by the disaster the heartfelt condolences of Cable & Wireless’ management and staff,” Mr Duncan said.
