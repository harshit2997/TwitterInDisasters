Kolkata, May 11 (IANS): Five leading Bangla bands have come together for a concert on May 22 to help victims of quake-hit Nepal. This would offer music lovers a unique chance to donate dry food items and obtain free passes for the show.

Renowned bands Fossils, Cactus, Lakkhichhara, Prithibi and Eeshaan will belt out popular songs from their vast repertoire at the 'Kolkata for Nepal' concert to lend a helping hand to the neighbouring Himalayan nation in its hour of need.

According to the organisers, Bangla Rock Magazine, no tickets will be sold for this concert.

"Entry passes will be available against donation of cereal bars or biscuits or dry food items which will be sent to ground NGOs working in Nepal through the Kolkata Sukriti Foundation," the organisers said.

One can also purchase cereal bars for donation online and avail passes. The venue of the concert is Nazrul Mancha in south Kolkata.

Nepal was hit by a massive earthquake measuring 7.9 on the Richter Scale on April 25, killing over 8,000 people, injuring more than 14,000 and rendering many homeless. Nepal's Prime Minister Sushil Koirala has expressed apprehensions about the toll touching 10,000.
