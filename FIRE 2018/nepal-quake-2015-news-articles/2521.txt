A 57-person task force of Southland firefighters was sent today to Nepal to help in rescue and recovery efforts following a magnitude-7.8 earthquake in that region, a county fire captain said.

The team departed the task force’s San Fernando Valley headquarters Sunday and was standing by at March Air Reserve Base in Riverside County this afternoon with an expected departure for Nepal as early as midnight, Los Angeles County Fire Capt. Roland Sprewell told City News Service.

The team was expected to arrive in the Nepalese capital Kathmandu on Monday, Sprewell said.

Thousands of people, including a Santa Monica-based documentary filmmaker Tom Taplin, were killed in the magnitude 7.8 earthquake, which struck just before noon local time Saturday -- just before 11:15 p.m. on Friday, California time. Taplin was in Nepal making a film about the community at the Mount Everest base camp, according to news reports.

Urban Search and Rescue Task Force Team 2, as it is known, was notified Saturday by the United States Agency for International Development (USAID) to gather its personnel and equipment and prepare for deployment, according to Sprewell, Public Information Officer with the county fire department’s Homeland Security Section.

Each member of the team has a specific area of expertise, from doctors to confined spaces and collapse experts to structural engineering specialists to dog handlers, he said.

“The majority are firefighter-paramedics,” Sprewell told CNS.

There are similar teams in other countries, but only two in the U.S.; and the other team, out of Fairfax County, Virginia, has already deployed to the region, according to Sprewell.

Past deployments of the Los Angeles-based task force, which started out as a Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) team responding only to domestic disasters, include the Japanese earthquake and tsunami in 2011, the Haiti earthquake in 2010, Hurricane Katrina in 2005, the 2001 terrorist attacks on the U.S., and the Oklahoma City bombing in 1995, Sprewell said.
