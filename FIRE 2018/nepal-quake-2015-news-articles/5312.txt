Worcester Lions heartened by news from Nepal

MEMBERS of Worcester Lions Club have been heartened to hear that a scheme they set up several years ago is still benefitting people in Nepal.

Just a few days before the recent earthquake the president of Worcester Lions Club was surprised to receive and email from a member of Sidmouth Lions Club.

The email included a picture of a street vendor's cart with a Lions sign and the name “Worcester Lions” included in the script on a side panel.

The picture had been taken a couple of weeks before at the end of a very busy street leading to Durbar Square in Kathmandu.

In 2011 Worcester Lions joined its twinned club Oreans Doyen, France and the Ladies Lion Club of Kathmandu Bhrikuti in raising money for a project to set up a vegetable cart scheme for 26 women with 64 children between them living in Dallu, a slum area of Kathmandu. Sheldon Lions Club also made a large donation to the project.

"The aim was to provide vegetable carts that would enable the women to work, earn money and thus feed, clothe and educate their children," said Geoff Lewis, of Worcester Lions.

"Another hope was that it would give them a chance to reform family life, become self-sufficient and be able to move into better accommodation."

On several occasions members of Worcester Lions Club visited to see how the project was progressing. Following one such visited it was reported that the design of the carts had been enhanced by adding a canopy and storage underneath which enabled them to carry 35 kilo of vegetables.

On another they had met both the families already operating the carts and others that were hoping to start working as soon a more carts had been purchased.

In total 26 carts were provided by the project.

Day to day running of the project was managed by one of the staff of Happy Home Orphanage and students from the university there. The students giving the women basic training in management of money, book keeping, weights and measures and food hygiene etc.

Mr Lewis said a member of Worcester Lions have been in touch with some of those that they know in the earthquake area. They are safe but the plight of the women operating the carts and the carts are not known.
