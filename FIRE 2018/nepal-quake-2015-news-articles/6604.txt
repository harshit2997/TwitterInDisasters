A 23-year-old student architect from Kent was killed in last month’s Nepal Earthquake, the Foreign Office has confirmed.

Matt Carapiet studied for a bachelor of architecture degree at Notingham University between 2010 and 2013 and had been an architectural intern at Zaha Hadid Architects since.

A statement released by Carapiet’s family following the Foreign Office’s anouncement at the weekend said he had been trekking in Nepal for two weeks before the earthquake struck on April 25 and had been planning to resume his architecture studies in the autumn.

Zaha Hadid Architects said Carapiet had shown great potential during his time at the practice.

‘Matt spent 20 months with us at Zaha Hadid Architects, proving to be a talented and gifted young designer with exquisite model making skills,’ the practice said in a statement.

‘He was a charming person and committed member of the team, all of whom are devastated to lose such a genuine friend.

‘The whole practice mourns this untimely loss, and our thoughts are with his family.’

David Short, a tutor in the Department of Architecture and Built Environment at the University of Nottingham, said staff and students had been hoping for news of Carapiet’s safe return since it emerged that he was missing in Nepal.

‘The events of this weekend represent a very sad outcome and have generated tributes from those who studied alongside Matt and from those who taught him,’ he said.

‘Our thoughts are with Matt’s family at this time.’

Carapiet’s page on the social networking site Linked In said he had also done a brief internship at Paul Davis + Partners prior to commencing his degree.
