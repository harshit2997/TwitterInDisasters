“Bangladesh will help the neighbour to tackle the catastrophe,” Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina’s Special Assistant Mahbubul Hoque Shakil said quoting the head of the government.



Bangladesh would also provide medical and humanitarian help, he said.



The government already conveyed its offer of help to Nepal, he added.



Nearly 1,400 people died in the earthquake on Saturday. The death toll may rise.



The foreign ministry said as Saturday’s Biman Bangladesh Airlines’ flight to Kathmandu was cancelled, two flights would be conducted on Sunday.
