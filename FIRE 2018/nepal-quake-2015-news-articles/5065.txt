SINDHUPALCHOK: Earthquake survivors in the inland regions of Nepal are now faced with another challenge of not having clean water supply, lack of food, no electricity and no roof over their heads.

More than a week after the disaster, survivors in these areas are feeling that the government and the international community have "abandoned" them as none have come to their plight to provide basic amenities for them to live.

theSun visited a small village in the hilly region of Nepal called Chap, some 10 km inland from the main road where about 600 people reside. According to the locals, theSun was the first outsider to enter the village since the earthquake.

"Do you have foods and clothes? Please spare some for us if you carry anything".

That was the plight from the locals as soon as we set our foot in the village.

Local Budi Bala Tamang, 62, said more than 90% of the houses in the village were destroyed and they had to live in makeshift tents.

He said 10 people had died and all effort to pull the bodies had to be done by the villagers themselves and among those dead were three family members of Narain Tamang, 43; his wife, mother and aunt were buried under his collapsed house.

"We had to recover the bodies using our own hands. Where is the government, the police, when we need them the most?" he said.

Narain who lives in a tent with his three sons finds it hard to find food and with no electricity, they shiver at night when temperature drops below 15Â° Celcius.

Their only source of water is from a river uphill.

The same plight was also seen at another village, Jaishithok, about 50 kilometres out of Kathmandu where the villagers dependency on their agriculture produce was gone with the earthquake destruction.

"We just manage with whatever is left to feed ourselves," said villager Apsara Khanal whose house was among the 46 houses destroyed in the earthquake.

She who lives in a tent with her family fears also being attacked by tigers from the nearby jungle which roams the village at night.
