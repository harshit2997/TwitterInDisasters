Karnataka docs lend a hand

Reshma Ravishanker, Bengaluru, Apr 30, 2015, DHNS: 0:33 IST

A team of doctors from Karnataka have begun attending to patients who are lying unattended at hospitals in Nepal due to lack of resources and manpower.



Dr G Srinivas, chief supervisor, Karnataka State Drugs Logistics And Warehousing Society, who is among the ten doctors from the State who left for Nepal three days ago to lend a helping hand, told Deccan Herald on Thursday that the team has received all necessary clearances from the Nepal health ministry to attend to cases in the hospitals.



So far, the doctors have been attending to cases in the make-shift camps and referring major cases to the medical college hospital. Dr Srinivas said that the State’s decision to send doctors from Karnataka to Nepal was an excellent one for that was the need of the hour.



“There are so many patients in the Tribhuvan University Teaching Hospital, Kathmandu, who have suffered major injuries and suffer fractures. There are plenty of cases lying unattended to duet to either shortage of manpower or resources. Since we have received the necessary clearances, we will be taking up even such cases tomorrow,” he added.



He added that most of the cases the team was attending to were orthopaedic in nature. “Apart from fractures, we are seeing several cases of diarrhoea, dysentery, and fever. The communicable diseases that are slowly on the rise are being treated in the camps itself,” Dr Srinivas added.



Dr T A Veerabhadraiah, president, Karnataka Medical Officers’ Association, told Deccan Herald here that the team has attended to several cases in two days’ time. The Disaster Management team has been allotting cases to the team of doctors and medical experts from here. “The doctors are staying at a place in Kathmandu and have been attending to patients in camps,” he added.



Dr H C Ramesh, director, Department of health and family welfare, said that the team comprising of orthopaedic surgeons have attended to three cases of fracture so far. “The drugs that have been sent from here have also reached Nepal. We have told the team to keep us posted if they are in need of anything else,” he added.



A team of ten doctors were deputed by the state government to help the victims of the earth-quake struck Himalayan nation.
