The person received on-site medical treatment and was rushed to a nearby hospital. Medics of the Chinese rescue team said the victim was in good physical condition.

On Sunday, a 62-member Chinese search and rescue team, along with six dogs, arrived in Nepal's capital, becoming the first international heavy urban search and rescue team in the Himalayan country.

A day later, on Monday morning, a 55-strong Chinese team also left for Nepal.

CCTV's correspondent Ravinder Bawa in Kathmandu has talked to the deputy team leader of the China International Search & Rescue Team. He told her about the people taking part in the rescue operations.
