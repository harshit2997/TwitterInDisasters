As the death toll from the Nepalese earthquake continues to rise a group of children the Maitland community supports remains unaccounted for.

DEVASTATION: A man walks in the rubble of collapsed houses in Bhaktapur.

As the death toll from the Nepalese earthquake continues to rise a group of children the Maitland community supports remains unaccounted for.



It is believed about 4000 people have so far died in the April 25 ­disaster, with children of The Umbrella Foundation possibly included in the toll.

“This is shocking and extremely devastating,” Linda Harwood, the Thornton woman behind the Australian branch of the ­foundation, said.

“We’ve rescued 380 children so far, but we have young people scattered all over Kathmandu and we have no idea whether they are alive or not. I’m just distraught.”

The Umbrella Foundation was established in 2005 to alleviate the impact of child trafficking, ­poverty and war in Nepal.

A 7.9 magnitude earthquake struck north-west Nepal on Saturday devastating the districts of Lamjung and Gorkha and entire sections of Kathmandu.

“This is the worst natural ­disaster to hit Nepal in 81 years and, with large aftershocks still rattling the region, the situation remains critical and conditions unstable,” Mrs Harwood said.

“To make matters worse, the weather is cold with rain expected over the next week at least.

“Most of the foundation’s youths and reintegrated children are still unaccounted for, but every effort is being made to contact and support the Umbrella family.”

Mrs Harwood is working to raise money for the people of Nepal.

“Access to clean water, food, shelter and medical supplies will be of paramount importance in the coming days and the focus will be on search and rescue as well as provision of shelter to the Nepali people,” she said.

“My role here is to get money together.

“I know Maitland is suffering [in the wake of last week’s storms], but we have every resource offered to us here, ­whereas it will be literally up to aid organisations to put Nepal back together.

“Our local perspective is tragic, but we will be rebuilt in a short period of time whereas Nepal won’t be rebuilt in 20 years.”
