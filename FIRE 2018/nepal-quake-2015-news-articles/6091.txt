VHP, HSS condemn Pakistan's beef relief to quake-hit Nepal

The state unit of the right-wing organisation Vishwa Hindu Parishad (VHP) has slammed Pakistan for sending beef condiments in food packets to Nepal, where a massive earthquake has killed thousands, saying the "terrorist state" did so deliberately to pollute the sanctity of the Hindu kingdom.



"This is Pakistan's modus operandi to intrude into India's neighbouring countries where its terror network is not operational," said VHP's state unit patron Ramakant Dubey.

"We have taken severe cognisance of the immoral act done by Pakistan and our central unit has decided to raise the issue on the world forum," Dubey added.

Vishwa Hindu Parishad is an international organisation with presence in many countries.

Dubey said the organisation has asked Nepal to stop receiving all aid from Pakistan.

"At a time when Nepal is grappling with the most unfortunate tragedies, Pakistan has acted inhumanly by sending 'beef masala' as a succor to the ailing Hindu community of the country," the VHP leader said.

Another right-wing organisation, the state Hindustan Shiv Sena (HSS) has also condemned Pakistan's action and termed it "deplorable".

"While Nepal is fighting a great crisis, Pakistan has committed the most heinous crime by sending beef condiments as relief to the Hindu dominant country to promote its agenda of Islamisation," said HSS president Rajesh Kesari.

He said world leaders should take cognisance of the "mischief" by Pakistan and act tough against the "rogue country" that has embarked on a two-fold agenda of spreading terrorism and Islamisation across the world.

Meanwhile, Hindu religious groups like Bajrang Dal and other social organisations of the state have decided to launch protests and agitations against the incident.
