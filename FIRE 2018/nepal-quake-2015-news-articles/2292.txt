A 62-member China International Search and Rescue Team (CISAR) arrived in Nepal's capital Katmandu at Sunday noon and started quake-relief work, according to the China Earthquake Administration.

The CISAR was the first international heavy rescue team to arrive in the country, which was jolted by an 8.1-magnitude earthquake.

The team set off at 6 a.m. Sunday Beijing time aboard a chartered plane and arrived in Nepal's capital city at about 12 a.m.

The team consists of 62 members, including rescuers, medical staff, earthquake experts and engineers, as well as six dogs well-trained for search and rescue.

The team has dispatched members to conduct field surveys and safety analysis in quake-hit zones, according to the administration.
