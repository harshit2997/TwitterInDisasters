Local Nepalese come together after quake

HOUSTON - The death toll continues to rise after an earthquake devastated the entire country of Nepal on Saturday.

Nepal's Home Ministry said the death from the quake has now reached 1,865 for the region. At least 10 of those were climbers on Nepal's Mount Everest. More than 4,700 people are injured.

The Nepalese community in Houston is banding together to support friends and family in the disaster zone. The community is pleading for the public's help and is collecting money rather than supplies because they said it's the quickest way to send help.

"We are here, we try to help people, those who are in need," Jyoti Ghimirey of the Nepalese Association of Houston said. "We have never done something this big."

Ghimirey found out about the earthquake through friends and could not believe what he was hearing.

"The buildings, the palaces, the temples that I have seen when I was growing -- it's not there now," he said."

Ghimery's has family members in Nepal and he said they are lucky because they have all been accounted for.

But the fear of an aftershock burns in their minds. Nearly two dozen aftershocks hit the Himalayan country after the initial quake, including a 6.6 shock, an hour later.

"It's a very unique situation," Ghimery said. "It's a sad situation."

The Associated Press has reported that neighboring South Asian countries also felt the quake, which killed 50 people in India, Tibet and Bangladesh.

The Nepalese Association of Houston is a nonprofit organization and they say your donations are tax-deductible.
