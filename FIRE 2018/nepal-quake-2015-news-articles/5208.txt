Sophie Kilpack told the Isle of Wight County Press of how she had pulled a body from a body from blood-soaked building when the 7.8 magnitude quake struck.Sophie, 24, of Carisbrooke Road, Carisbrooke, was finishing three and a half years of travelling when she attended a tattoo convention in the trouble-hit area."The power went out and the ground fell from under our feet. It was like being on a boat and being hit by a big wave."I was so lucky I wasn't under anything flimsy."You don't really understand what is going on, you are just in disbelief and my heart was going 100mph."When further earthquakes and aftershocks hit the area, Sophie heard people crying or singing protection mantras.She walked to Durbar Square to see if she could help people and ended up sleeping in the clearing with other survivors.In the morning she was clearing away debris from the ruins of a hotel when she came across a woman's trapped body."The army and police didn't seem to be interested in getting her out, but I was saying this could be your mother or your sister."Sophie began stripping back the rubble with her bare hands and was eventually assisted."I could see so much blood."Sophie stayed for a few days, hoping to help survivors, but decided to leave under advice from the British Embassy."You are just another mouth to feed, someone else to split water with and another bum on a bed."But, knowing all that doesn't help with the mixed feelings of shame and guilt for leaving.""When we took off no-one really believed we were going to get out of there, so it was just absolute relief. Everyone clapped when we took off. But, there was a great feeling of shame for leaving people behind, which is why we want to fund raise."Sophie will climb Ben Nevis in Scotland with friends to help fundraise for Unicef's Nepal fund.Money can be pledged at www.justgiving.com/zara-cochrane and the climb will take place on May 30.Read more on how Islanders are helping in the Nepal aid effort in todayâ€™s Isle of Wight County Press, Friday, May 8.
