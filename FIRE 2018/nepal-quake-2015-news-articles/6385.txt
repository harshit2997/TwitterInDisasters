(MENAFN - Gulf Times) Ooredoo has announced a QR1mn donation to Qatar Charity (QC) and Qatar Red Crescent (QRC), which will support their humanitarian efforts in Nepal after the devastating earthquake that took place on April 25.The 7.8-magnitude earthquake shook Nepal and neighbouring countries, triggering avalanches and mudslides and devastating whole villages. The UN estimates that 8mn people have been affected by the earthquake, and that 2.8mn people have been displaced by it.The donation has been made possible by Ooredoo's Easy-to-Remember Number Fund, which raises money for charity through the auction of prestigious mobile phone numbers.As well as the donation, Ooredoo is encouraging employees and customers to donate money towards several charities working in the country to support their emergency appeal for healthcare, shelter, water, sanitation support and to restore family links.Customers can donate to QC and QRC via Ooredoo's nationwide self-service machine network. With over 200 self-service machines spread across the country, donations to the charities can be made by cash or credit/debit card during this time of need.Upon hearing news of the natural disaster, Ooredoo immediately cut the cost of international calls to Nepal to enable expatriates based in Qatar to call home and connect with friends and families more easily.Ooredoo has a long history of working with Qatar's charities in times of emergency.For more information on how to donate to the natural disaster victims, visit http://www.qcharity.com/ and http://www.qrcs.org.qa
