About 2,000 Chinese tourists have arrived home, while 400 remained stranded at a airport in quake-hit Kathmandu as airlines race to evacuate them following Saturday's earthquake, said Chinese Embassy in Nepal on Monday.

China's emergency rescue hotline 12308 has been open to Chinese residents who need help in Nepal, said Foreign Ministry Spokesperson Hong Lei on his regular press conference on Monday.

Hong Lei said there were about 4,000 Chinese tourists in Nepal before the earthquake.

Four Chinese nationals in Nepal have died, and another ten were seriously injured. Another 25 residents in Tibet autonomous region have also died, while 58 were injured in the quake.

The death toll from Saturday's earthquake in Nepal has climbed to 4,264 people, including 20 mountaineers, and more than 7,000 others were injured, said the National Emergency Operation Center of Nepal's Home Ministry on Tuesday morning.
