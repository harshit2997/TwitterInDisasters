UMass offering support to Nepali students; student asks people to donate to relief
</headline>

AMHERST - The University of Massachusetts on Monday sent a campus-wide email about services that are available to anyone who needs them following the earthquake early Saturday morning in Nepal.

So far, more than 4,000 people have been confirmed killed, and the number is expected to climb. More than 7,000 have been injured.

"The earthquake that hit the area has taken the lives of thousands in the region and left countless more injured or homeless. Our hearts go out to all of the people who have been affected by this disaster, including our own students, faculty and staff who come from Nepal," UMass Chancellor Kumble Subbaswamy said in a release.

"We want those students and community members to know we are here for them," he said. The email provided the websites for four campus offices offering support including the Center for Counseling and Psychological Health.

UMass has 11 undergraduate and graduate students from Nepal on campus, according to spokesman Edward F. Blaguszewski.

The campus also provided links to 10 websites for people to give.

UMass postdoctoral student and Nepali native Kabindra Shakya said that donating money is the most helpful thing anyone can do.

Shakya and his wife's family are from the capital city Katmandu, and he has had just brief conversations with family members. He can't get through to them, and when they phone, calls are terminated after five minutes so the phone lines don't get jammed, he said.

He said his family is all right, but like hundreds of thousands of others, they are too afraid to go back inside because of the aftershocks, so they are sleeping in tents outside. He said there have been 80 aftershocks, several very powerful.

He got a call at about 4 a.m. Saturday about the earthquake and couldn't sleep that first night. All he could do was try to contact family and watch the news. "So many people are still trapped," he said.

His family is without electricity and potable water and food is scarce and getting harder to find. That makes it hard to focus on his studies, he said.

He is hoping there is an outpouring of aid, and people should designate that any donations they make to relief agencies are for Nepal earthquake relief. He said the country is already one of the poorest in the world and "the poorest are hit the hardest."

Recommended charities include International Medical Corps, Catholic Relief, Lutheran World Relief, American Jewish Joint Distribution, World Vision, Doctors without Borders, Handicap International, American Jewish World Service, Global Giving and Mercy Corps.
