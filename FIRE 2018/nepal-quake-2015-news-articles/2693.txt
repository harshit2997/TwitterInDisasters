Dear Rahul Gandhi, are you going to Punjab now because Nepal quake news has lost intensity?
</headline>

<text>
New Delhi, April 28: Congress Vice-President Rahul Gandhi on Tuesday suddenly started for Punjab to personally assess the crop damage and the procurement challenges of the farmers in the agriculturally rich state.

He will speak to farmers in Sirhind, Gobindgarh and Khanna in Malwa region of the state and ask the ruling SAD-BJP government to treat the produce fairly besides compensating the farmers for the crop loss.

The visit was said to be a precursor to a kisan padyatra by the Congress leader across the country in the coming days to counter the ruling BJP government.

The 44-year-old leader also took a train to Punjab to express his solidarity with the farmers.

Was this visit by Rahul Gandhi pre-planned? Or was it just an effort to steal the limelight after allowing the Nepal earthquake news to die down?

Such a possibility can not be ruled out really for the Congress vice-president's visit to Kedartnath shrine last week could not get much mileage, thanks to the devastating earthquake that rocked Nepal and many parts of India.

The decision to travel by train amid the aam janta could also have been compelled by Prime Minister Narendra Modi's recent ride in Delhi Metro. The way the Gandhi is chasing Modi over various issues, including land bill and net neutrality, the possibility of trying to overtake the likes of Modi and Arvind Kejriwal in the race to get closer to the common people can't be ruled out either.
