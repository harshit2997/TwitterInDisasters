The Hong Kong government on Tuesday raised the Outbound Travel Alert for Nepal to red because of the devastating earthquake there on Saturday.

A government spokesman said Hong Kong residents intending to visit Nepal should adjust their travel plans and avoid non- essential travel, including leisure travel.

Those who are already there should pay attention to announcements by local authorities, particularly on possible aftershocks. They should also exercise caution and pay attention to their personal safety.

The spokesman added that Hong Kong residents in Nepal who need assistance may call the Hong Kong Immigration Department's 24-hour hotline on (852) 1868 or contact the Chinese Embassy in Nepal on ( 977) 9801037888.

The death toll from Saturday's earthquake in Nepal has climbed to 4,264 people, including 20 mountaineers, and more than 7,000 others were injured, said the National Emergency Operation Center of Nepal's Home Ministry on Tuesday morning.
