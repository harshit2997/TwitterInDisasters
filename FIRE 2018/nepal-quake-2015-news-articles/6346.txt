U.S. and Nepalese forces on Wednesday continued their search for a Marine Corps helicopter that went missing Tuesday in northeastern Nepal while delivering relief supplies — and elite Air Force pararescuemen are now involved, according to American military officials.

The UH-1Y Venom helicopter vanished after taking off from the town of Charikot, in the Himalayan Mountains. The area was ravaged by a 7.8-magnitude earthquake that struck April 25 and killed more than 8,000 people, prompting an international aid effort.

Marine Brig. Gen. Paul Kennedy told The Washington Post in a brief e-mail sent from Nepal late Wednesday there that search-and-rescue efforts were not successful before dark, and would continue on Thursday. The terrain “is beyond description,” he said.

The aircraft involved in the search included two UH-1 helicopters departing from Kathmandu, Nepal’s capital, said Army Maj. Dave Eastburn, a spokesman for U.S. Pacific Command. Each one was carrying several U.S. Marines, a Nepalese soldier and two Air Force pararescuemen. The Air Force troops, commonly known as “PJs,” are trained in Special Operations and are specialists in recovering personnel from downed aircraft.

One of the helicopters was fitted with a hoist that allows it to reach locations where the mountainous terrain prevents landing, Eastman said. After the helicopters returned to Kathmandu, two MV-22B Osprey aircraft took their place in search efforts, and the aircraft rotated throughout the day.

The missing helicopter is with Marine Light Attack Squadron 469, of Camp Pendleton, Calif. The Venom, also known as a “Super Huey” or “Yankee,” is a newer version of the UH-1 Huey helicopter the military has used for decades. It has seen service everywhere from Afghanistan to the Pacific since it was adopted in 2008.

Relief efforts continued in Nepal, which suffered an additional 7.3-magnitude earthquake on Tuesday that killed dozens more people. The U.S. military unit there, Joint Task Force 505, now includes hundreds of troops, and is working alongside other agencies.
