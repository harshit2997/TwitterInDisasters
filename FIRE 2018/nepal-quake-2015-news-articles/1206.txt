Former Alice Springs mayor Fran Kilgariff caught up in Nepalese earthquake disaster

Updated

The former mayor of Alice Springs has had a lucky escape after the Nepalese earthquake struck while she was inside a shaking building.

Fran Kilgariff was on holiday when the massive quake struck on Saturday near Kathmandu.

Her family in Alice Springs only found out she was alright when a stranger rang to pass on the message.

Ms Kilgariff's son Paul Erlich said in the initial chaos they had difficulties getting the stranger to put her on the phone.

"I rang back and spoke to an interpreter who went and got Fran from the street and brought her inside," he said.

"She said she was fine. She was in a building when the earthquake happened."

Mr Erlich said somehow the building his mum was in did not collapse.

"The building was shaking and she couldn't get out until it stopped and obviously ... she said there was a lot of other buildings around that had collapsed during the earthquake."

Mr Erlich said his mum sounded "cool, calm and collected" but obviously under duress.

"I knew obviously she was probably in a bit of shock as well. Her day had changed quite dramatically."

"I didn't know if she had food or water ... because after an earthquake you don't know what's around and she's been there for a day or two."

Mr Erlich said Ms Kilgariff had spent the night sleeping on the street in Kathmandu before making her way to the airport, which was overwhelmed with people trying to get out of the devastated area.

"I believe there's very large queues of people leaving and some people have already left, and we're just waiting to hear from her once she's actually made it to her next destination."

Darwin man trekking in Annapurna 'is safe'

Meanwhile, Darwin-based lawyer Ron Levy has confirmed he is alive and well after being listed as missing in Nepal.

Mr Levy, 55, was among the hundreds of Australians in Nepal but his former colleague Syd Stirling said Mr Levy made contact by email late on Sunday night to say he was alive and well.

"Ron Levy is in the Annapurna region and certainly felt the earthquake but that region has been fortunately free of any casualties or damage," Mr Stirling told the ABC.

Mr Stirling said Mr Levy had been "trekking the Annapurna circuit".

As on late Monday morning, Mr Levy was still listed as missing on a Red Cross website.
