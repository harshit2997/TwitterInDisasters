Jacqui Lambie wants $50 million Indonesia aid switched to Nepal
</headline>

<text>
INDEPENDENT Tasmanian Senator Jacqui Lambie says Australia should take the $50 million it gives in foreign aid to Indonesia and send it to Nepal where is it desperately needed.

Senator Lambie also urged Australians to boycott any plans they had to holiday in Bali – or elsewhere in Indonesia – and spend the money in Australia.

Senator Lambie already has urged the Federal Governet to scrap aid to Indonesia in the face of its plans to execute Australian Bali Nine members Andrew Chan and Muyaran Sukumaran.

She reiterated that statement on the eve of their proposed execution overnight, saying the people of Nepal, who were dealing with a massive humanitarian disaster after Saturday’s devastating earthquake, unlike Indonesia, deserved Australia’s help.

“What is happening in Indonesia right now is disgusting,” Ms Lambie said.

“Indonesia’s president is playing at the art of war.

“He is toying with those boys and using them as a political pawn.”

Seantor Lambie has been calling on Prime Minister Tony Abbott to “put his foot down” and “pull the bloody foreign aid” since the pair’s potential fate became clearer.

“If you want to talk about executions, we lost 88 people in the Bali bombs over there. And you know, those people that were part of that outfit are now walking out on the streets,” she said.

In February, she said: “I find Indonesia to be ­extremely two-faced.”
