Washington, Apr 30: US President Barack Obama today called Nepalese Prime Minister Sushil Koirala to convey his deep condolences for the victims of the devastating quake and extended his full support for the rescue and relief mission.

"The President earlier today spoke with Prime Minister Sushil Koirala of Nepal to convey the deep condolences of the American people for the loss of life and massive destruction caused by the April 25th earthquake in Nepal," White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest told reporters.

"They discussed the ongoing efforts by US civilian and military personnel to assist the government of Nepal and international organizations in the disaster response efforts, including with rescue and logistics support," Earnest said.

Obama pledged that the US will do all it can to help the people of Nepal in this time of need, the spokesperson said.

Two top US Senators Ben Cardin, Ranking Member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, and Jim Risch, Chairman of the Subcommittee on Near East, South Asia, Central Asia, and Counterterrorism introduced a resolution today offering support for Nepal and its neighbors in the aftermath of the deadly earthquake that struck the region on Saturday.

The resolution also applauds the rapid mobilization by the Department of State, USAID and the Department of Defense in quickly and effectively marshaling resources and responding to both the short and long-term needs in Nepal.

"The people of Nepal and South Asia must know that in their hour of need, the United States is providing assistance to the region and that engagement will only continue. We can only imagine their anguish and pain," Cardin said.
