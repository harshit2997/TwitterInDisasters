Chinese Foreign Ministry says President Xi Jinping and Premier Li Keqiang sent messages of condolences to Nepali leaders soon after the quake. China has promised 20 million yuan worth of emergency aid, and the materials will soon be transported to the country by air. Foreign Ministry spokesman Hong Lei also spoke of practical help on the ground.

"A 62-strong Chinese international rescue team arrived in Nepal on Sunday morning and immediately begun work. That afternoon they saved one person. A 58-member Chinese international medical team also arrived on Monday morning and began treatment and disease prevention," Hong said.

"Another 17-member medical team deployed in Nepal has also begun work. And 170 rescue workers from the People's Liberation Army are on their way. China is also sending 186 tons of emergency supplies including tents and blankets. Four flights will arrive in Nepal today and tomorrow."
