***END UPDATE***







People in Nepal are cremating the dead and digging through rubble for the missing, a day after a massive Himalayan earthquake killed more than 2,500 people.





They've had to deal with a series of aftershocks, including a magnitude 6.7 shaker that made buildings sway in the capital, Kathmandu, and sent panicked residents running into the streets.





Kathmandu's airport has reopened and supplies, doctors and relief workers have begun arriving.





Some of the survivors of the earthquake-generated avalanche that swept through the Mount Everest base camp have now reached Nepal's capital. They've been taken to hospitals but none appeared to have life-threatening injuries. At least 17 people were killed on the mountain.





Most areas remain without power and water. Workers are sending out tents and relief goods in trucks and helicopters. The number of injured is in the thousands.





The magnitude 7.8 quake killed more than 2,100 people in Nepal, and more than 60 others in India, Bangladesh, Tibet and Pakistan. The death toll is expected to rise.
