China Aviation Industry Corporation (AVIC) has on Wednesday pledged cooperation and support for the earthquake victims of Nepal.[Special coverage]

During a meeting with the officials of Nepal Airlines Corporation (NAC) in Kathmandu, the Chinese company pledged full assistance in this difficult period of neighboring nation.

"We are ready to assist in the relief programs in Nepal in whatever ways we can", President of AVIC International Zhang Guang Jian told Xinhua.

He also informed that the two aircrafts MA60 and Y12e handed over by AVIC International to NAC are assisting in the rescue and relief programs in quake-hit districts.

Chairman of NAC Shiva Sharan Neupane told Xinhua, "The assistance of Chinese Aircraft Company is really praiseworthy at this moment."

He added, "Though we cannot receive any donations or logistics support, I have asked them to support through Prime Minister's relief fund."

NAC will be receiving four more Chinese-made aircraft one MA60 and three Y12e later this year through soft loans.
