</headline>

<text>
The world is full of events that have caused severe distress for millions of innocent people caught in floods earthquakes fires and typhoons. It is always incredible how when there is a disaster people rally together and help one another. The most recent catastrophic event is the huge devastation caused by a massive earthquake in Nepal. Relief efforts require money and it goes without saying that any amount helps people with shelter, food, clean drinking water and medical attention.

Canada is well known for its efforts on the humanitarian front and the Canadian online gambling operator Amaya has stepped up to the plate to offer assistance to the people of Nepal. Amaya, through its PokerStars and Full Tilt web locations, has announced that it will match, dollar for dollar any donation to the relief effort in Nepal. PokerStars and Full Tilt are calling on the poker community to support relief operations in earthquake devastated Nepal. All funds generated for the relief fund will be forwarded to CARE International, a reputable relief organization which has already mobilized efforts in the region. As many as a million inhabitants in the capital of Kathmandu and surrounding regions, may be in need of assistance in the quakeâ€™s aftermath. The PokerStars and Full Tilt poker sites have also made temporary additions to the way donations to the fund can be made, whether through direct fund transfers, charity tournaments, and even transfers of unused Frequent Player Points.

Acting quickly to organize a relief effort is important and Amaya has been quick to respond to the need similar to PokerStars and Full Tilt Typhoon Haiyan relief efforts in 2013. The company deserves praise for its humanitarian effort in the past and now for its generosity at this time. Please help those who have suffered in Nepal and support them by giving as much as you can to this worthy cause.
