CHOPRAK (Gorkha): The narrow, winding road that branches off Prithvi Rajmarg at 'Bahrakilo', 12km south of Gorkha town, turns slushy and steep at Ramailo Basti — one of the many villages en route to Barpak, the quake's epicentre."We saw smoke snaking out from below the ground at the end of our village. We thought the earth's belly would open up, everything from underneath would come out and bury us," recalled Buddhi Bahadur Baniya. The tremors have made every family at Ramailo Basti homeless.Ramailo Basti is upset no relief's reached. "You are the first to visit us," Buddhi said. "Please tell our governments that nobody has come to us — not the Nepal army nor the Indian Army," pleaded the former policeman. A baby in her arms, Sabitri Thapa added, "We've nothing to eat. Last night we ate roasted corn for dinner. I skipped breakfast and don't know what to have next."Not knowing who to turn to for help, villagers mention Maoist leader Baburam Bhattarai's ancestral house across river Daraundi. Villagers said their Maoist representative Hitraj Pandey is yet to visit them.All three representatives from Gorkha district are from the Communist Party of Nepal (Unified Maoists).The village women said they urgently need tarpaulins. It's been almost a week since the quake, Sita said, "How long can we live in the open?" Tales of loss and sorrow echo across Choprak and Chorkati. "Our school is damaged," Ramkazi Shrestha, a teacher, said. "Government should immediately give easy loans to rebuild houses."The more remote villages, accessible even in normal times only on foot, are a trail of death and destruction —Simjong, Saurpani, Jaubari, Muchok, Taku, Laprak among others. "These villages are very far, some a three hour walk, others at two days of trekking. There are no roads," said Hari Regmi.
