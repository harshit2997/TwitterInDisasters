Girl's Day are the next K-Pop celebrities to donate to Nepal after the devastating earthquake.





On May 1, the Korea National Red Cross said, "In order to help the victims in Nepal, Girl's Day donated 10 million KRW (~ $9,000 USD) to the Korea National Red Cross."





Girl's Day, which has donated a considerable amount to other causes in the past, stated, "In order to give to the citizens of Nepal, who lost their family and friends to a sudden and strong earthquake, strength so that they could stand again, the members decided on our own to donate. It's a small amount, but we hope that they'll be able to return as soon as possible to the way they were before the earthquake."

Minah had even written on Instagram back on April 26 after the earthquake, "Pray for Nepal, please be strong."





Meanwhile, the Korea National Red Cross will be leaving for Nepal on May 4 in order to help out any way they can.
