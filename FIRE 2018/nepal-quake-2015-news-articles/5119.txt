Medical Team Aids Nepal

DELAWARE - Medical officials with the Delaware Medical Relief Team are reportedly headed overseas to help victims in the devastating earthquake that took place Saturday, April 25.

Reports say volunteers are currently forming several medical relief teams to deploy to Nepal as soon as possible. According to their website an advance team of three doctors departed to Kathmandu yesterday.

DMRT will apparently be coordinating with both the official Nepal Government National Emergency Operations Center (NEOC), and a local NGO which runs a 100-bed community hospital in Kathmandu.

If you would like to volunteer or donate to their relief efforts visit their website at www.delawaremedicalreliefteam.org.
