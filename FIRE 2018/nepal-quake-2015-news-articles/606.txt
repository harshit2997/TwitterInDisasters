MANILA - The Philippine Red Cross (PRC) is preparing resources and mobilizing teams it may send to Nepal, which is facing a humanitarian crisis following the magnitude 7.9 earthquake that struck on Saturday afternoon.

PRC chairman Richard Gordon said the Philippine chapter is just waiting for coordination procedures from the Nepal chapter.

“Our staff and volunteers are prepared to work with the International Federation of the Red Cross (IFRC) and Red Crescent Societies’ and the Nepal Red Cross with respect to our role in assessment, rescue, relief, and other operations,” Gordon said.

“We will send whatever we could that would help in easing the suffering of the people of Nepal. The Philippine Red Cross is part of a global organization whose goal is to alleviate human suffering. With the Philippines also frequently hit by different disasters, we can imagine how devastated the people of Nepal must be after the terrible loss of lives and widespread damage caused by the earthquake,” PRC secretary general Gwendolyn Pang added.

Gordon said the PRC is also coordinating with the Canadian Red Cross to find a way to immediately send assistance as access to the devastated areas is a problem.

Gordon noted that leaders of the Nepal Red Cross were recently in the Philippines to observe humanitarian efforts in connection with the Yolanda disaster.

“We truly feel the tragedy and great difficulties that the people of Nepal are currently faced with, and feel we must support the operations of Nepal Red Cross. Leaders of the Nepal Red Cross recently visited and observed PRC Yolanda operations recently,” he said.

According to reports, the death toll from the Nepal earthquake has already reached more than 2,000.
