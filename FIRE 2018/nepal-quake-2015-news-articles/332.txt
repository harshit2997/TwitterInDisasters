The National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA) of Pakistan has been readied to take the relief assistance at a short notice.

Pakistani Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif, who is presently in London on an official visit, has expressed his deep shock over the massive earthquake that has caused devastation in Nepal, north and eastern India this morning.

"The Government of Pakistan and its people extend their heartfelt condolences and sympathies to the Governments and the peoples of Nepal and India on the tragedy that has caused loss of precious lives and properties," said the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.

"The Government and people of Pakistan express solidarity with the affected people of Nepal and India and offer all possible help that may be required in their hour of grief," it added. "The Government of Pakistan has instructed its Missions in the two countries to approach their respective host governments to ascertain the damages caused and the requirement of relief assistance," it added.

The National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA) of Pakistan has been readied to take the relief assistance at a short notice. At least 34 people died in India after an earthquake measuring 7.9 on the Richter scale hit neighbouring Nepal.
