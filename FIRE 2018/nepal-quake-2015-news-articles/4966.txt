Kathmandu - Earthquakes in Nepal and initiatives of solidarity from across the globe continue. In a statement sent to Agenzia Fides, Caritas Internationalis reports on the situation and on aid brought in areas that they have managed to reach. Speaking from Pokhari Danda in Gorkha, 15 km from the epicenter, Stefen Teplan of Caritas Germany has indicated that "60% of the village is destroyed. More than food and water, what is needed most is temporary shelters before the monsoon sets in". Dead and missing continue to rise, more than 130,000 homes have been destroyed and 85,000 partially damaged. There are many areas in the country affected. This includes mountain and hilly areas where rural populations are dispersed. Caritas has reached 4,000 households in the Kathmandu Valley with plastic sheets, blankets and food. Teams have also reached some of the worst affected rural areas of Gorkha, Sindapalchowk, Nuwakot and Kavre. The priority is shelter

"The people who lost their homes are exposed to the rain and cold weather, day and night. They really need all the international solidarity", said Angan Baj, Emergency Response Manager for Caritas India, who is with the team visiting villages in Gorkha. Caritas will also be providing clean water, sanitation and counselling. Caritas Internationalis Secretary General Michel Roy says Caritas has been flooded with donations and solidarity from across the globe.
