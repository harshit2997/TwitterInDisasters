Direct Relief Medical Supplies Reach Quake Victims In Nepal

GOLETA, Calif. - A FedEx plane carrying life-saving medical materials landed in Nepal on Sunday.

The charter flight carried aid from three organizations, including $15 million in supplies from Direct Relief.

"It's the largest infusion of medical material into the country since the earthquake happened two weeks ago," said Direct Relief CEO Thomas Tighe.

The plane was met by teams on the ground in Kathmandu to help unload the shipment.

Tighe is in Kathmandu to make sure prescription medicines, IV solutions, anti-infective agents, gloves, nutritional products, wound care supplies, and medical equipment get to hospitals and local organizations.

"Some of the partner groups actually came out and picked it up from the airport and we arranged trucks from the United Nations to deliver it to some of the hospitals around Kathmandu swamped with patients," Tighe said.

Direct Relief also purchased 20 hospital tents with solar lighting for expectant moms in the quake zone.

"We've brought in tents so they can provide birthing centers, so we can get the 5,000 women who are expecting in the next several weeks a safe place so they can deliver their babies," Tighe said.

Tighe also videotaped a personal message to Direct Relief's donors.



"People in Nepal are thrilled by this and we are honored to be able to help. I cannot say thank you enough to all the people who made contributions and otherwise supported Direct Relief. It makes a huge difference here to these people living through a very tough time. Thank you for what you've done," Tighe said.
