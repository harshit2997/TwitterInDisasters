KATHMANDU, Nepal (WATE) – First responders from Knoxville-based Remote Area Medical are on the ground in Nepal after the devastating 7.8 earthquake there.

The first team of RAM responders checked in with health department officials Wednesday in a town just east of Kathmandu. Team leader Paul Maresca attended a World Health Organization meeting Wednesday. The RAM crew says they do not yet know the severity of the damage in the region they were assigned or how much work lies ahead of them.
