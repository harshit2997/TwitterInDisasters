MINNEAPOLIS--Tour buses in Nepal turned into relief vehicles as rescuers continue to dig through rubble Monday. More than 4,000 people are dead and thousands more displaced. This version of Nepal is one Dr. Adiel Tel-Oren has never seen in his 15 years of work there.

"I just returned from Nepal a couple of weeks ago taking a group there on a trek," Tel-Oren said.

Tel-Oren, founder of the uptown restaurant Ecopolitan, also leads the non-profit Ecopolitan Eco-Health Community, which helped build several schools in Nepal. His organization also helped develop many villages, two of which were at the heart of the earthquake.

"Some of the villages don't even have one house left standing and all the villages have to basically go to our school yards to sleep there and they have no food," he said.

Five of his schools were destroyed and seven staff members killed. Broken-hearted but hopeful, Tel-Oren is determined to help rebuild.

He's raising money and returning to Nepal in two weeks to help with relief efforts, hoping to get people back in their homes before monsoon season starts in May.

"They are such caring people and they deserve better so I hope that we can all help them and care for them," he said.

Rebuilding one home will cost between $500-$1,000, according to Tel-Oren.
