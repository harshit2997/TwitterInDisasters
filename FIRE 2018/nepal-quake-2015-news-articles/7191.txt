Colombo (AsiaNews) – In a message calling on the members of his diocese to raise money for Nepal quake survivors, Mgr Emmanuel Fernando, auxiliary bishop of Colombo (Sri Lanka), said, “The Archdiocese of Colombo wishes to extend its Christian love to the people of Nepal, who have suffered incredibly because of the recent disaster”.

“We want to do everything possible to alleviate their suffering,” he wrote. For this to happen, donations must be sent to Seth Sarana, the Archdiocesan Centre for Human Development, which then will turn them over to the Apostolic Vicariate of Nepal.

Mgr Fernando launched the fundraiser from the pages of Catholic Messenger and Ganartha Pradeepaya, the archdiocese’s English and Sinhala papers.

Meanwhile, the Conference of Major Religious Superiors (CMRS) in Sri Lanka is also taking in donations from all over the country, which they will send to Caritas Nepal. Catholic schools, associations, convents and parishes can contribute until 30 May.

Anyone who wishes to make a donation can do so through Seth Sarana. See below for details:
