If all goes as planned, local globetrotter Stephane Chouinard will be back in Timmins by May 15 after surviving the earthquake that devastated Nepal late last month. His mother Edith Chouinard and a large group supporters plan to meet him at the airport and hold a large welcome back celebration.

“There will be like 30 people at the airport to greet him. It's a surprise; he doesn't know,” said Edith Chouinard. “We are also having a barbecue.”

Stephane Chouinard is an avid world traveller who just happened to be in Nepal when it was shaken by a 7.8 magnitude earthquake on April 25. During the chaotic aftermath, he was forced to travel through Nepal on foot for weeks looking for a way to get out of the country.

Initially, he was heading for the airport in the Nepalese capital of Kathmandu, not knowing that it was shut down and was quickly becoming a refugee camp. Once warned that the airport was not the place to go, Stephane Chouinard and his group began walking to the airport in the city of Pokhara in order to catch a bus that would take them across the border into India.

According to Edith Chouinard, her son arrived in Pokhara on Friday night. He already has a flight booked in India that will get him back to Canada and then on to Timmins. His mother says that after thinking he might have died, this homecoming will be like no other.

“He's been travelling for years and years. So I'm kind of used to it, but not this time. I will be very happy when he gets here, and we can be together again,” she said.

Stephane Chouinard's flight is expected to arrive at the Timmins airport at 4:20 p.m. on May 15.
