Hyderabad rescuers on a mission

Hyderabad: A group of concerned residents are going against the human instinct of leaving a disaster to reach out to those affected by the earthquake in Nepal. Some are even planning to fly to Nepal to take part in the relief and rescue operations.

The Greater Hyderabad Adventure Club has received several requests from individuals who wish to travel and help in the relief operations.

Suresh Kochattil, co-organiser with GHAC, said: “Besides the government’s efforts, it is heartening to see private participation to help the Nepalese citizens to rebuild their lives.”

The requests come from people who have some real skills to offer — from those who are trained in first aid to those having experience in rescue or even having knowledge of the terrain of the country.

Vizag native Sushma Kongara was torn when she saw her city ripped apart by Cyclone Hudhud. “I am based out of Hyderabad. But when I saw the devastation that Hudhud had caused in my home town, I immediately went there to help out in any way I can. There, I saw the reality of these disasters and the pain that people go through. That has stayed with me and it is that very experience that now motivates me to go Nepal.”

Also hoping to reach Nepal in a day or two is BMC certified mountaineer M.V. Girinath Reddy. He makes constant checks on Google looking for a window of opportunity to travel to Kathmandu.

“I just saw an update that the airport is now open. I am checking with a few city organisations to see if anyone is going or not. But whether or not I get support from the organisations here, I will just travel there and try to reach out to local NGOs,” he says. His drive comes from a personal connect with the country.

“As a mountaineer I am aware of what happens when things go wrong. I care about the human lives affected by the disaster.,” said Girinath Reddy, who undertook a bike ride from Hyderabad to Nepal, seven months ago.
