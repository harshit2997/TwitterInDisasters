All relief items accepted via the News1st, Sirasa Shakthi Sri Lanka for Nepal Humanitarian programme for those affected by the Nepal earthquake will be distributed within the next two days.

Relief items will be handed over to the Disaster Management Centre for distribution in Nepal.

News1st, Sirasa and Shakthi commenced the collection of relief for the victims of Nepal on Sunday.

We, who always extend our hand to those in need, have received assistance from the Ministry of Disaster Management, the Disaster Management Centre, security forces and the Police Environment Unit to carry out this endeavour.

The Ministry of Foreign Affairs is assisting in the Coordination of this endeavour.

Relief items were collected at the Harrisons Building 330, TB Jayah Mawatha, Colombo 10.

Based on our request we received blankets, warm clothing, drinking water, milk powder, canned fish, dry rations, first aid kits, tents, baby products and women’s sanitary items.

However, we had to halt the collection of relief at noon on Tuesday due to the lack of space in the aircraft carrying the cargo to Nepal.

As roads in Nepal have been ruined by the earthquake and as the Katmandu Airport is only open for relief services, only limited air services are in operation.

Therefore, based on the instructions and guidelines by the Disaster Management Centre we handed over your generous contributions to the centre.

The Disaster Management Centre notes that steps will be taken to transport the relief to Nepal on Wednesday.

You came forward when your countrymen were in need of help – today you have come forward to assist our neighbours. We extend our heartfelt gratitude to you!
