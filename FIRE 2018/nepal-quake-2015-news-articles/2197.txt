Jacksonville, Fla. â€” The Nepali community on the First Coast learned in the wee hours of Saturday morning their native country was ravaged by an earthquake with the death toll now 4,000 people and climbing.

Nepal, which borders India, is one of the poorest countries in the world with a heavy concentration of people living in the mythical city of Katmandu.

"Since Saturday afternoon managed to raise $7,000," said Amod Pyakuryal who is the president of the Jacksonville Chapter of UFNA/FANS which promotes the cultural heritage of Nepal.

In a country where most buildings are of concrete with little or no structural reinforcement, the earthquake reduced them to ruble.

In rural, isolated areas rescuers have yet to reach mountain villages days after magnitude 7.8 quake hit around noon Nepal time last Friday.

Baburam Adhikari says social media, Facebook, has been his connection to information about loved ones.

"My family is alright, house is damaged, " said Adhikari who is joining the local Nepali community in raising money to help those in need.

Relief aid is pouring in from around the world to assist in the rescue and medical needs of the country that are overwhelming the country.

The local Nepali community is organizing a candlelight vigil for Tuesday night. No details yet on where at one time that vigil will happen.
