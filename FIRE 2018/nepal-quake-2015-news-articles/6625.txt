The beautiful land-locked country of Nepal was yet again jolted by an earthquake measuring 7.4 on the Richter scale on Tuesday, May 12, just two weeks after India’s neighbours were left helpless with a devastating 7.8 earthquake. This was the second major quake after the first one left more than 8,000 dead. While Nepal remained the epicentre of the quake, strong tremors were felt in the neighbouring areas of India and Bangladesh. Several parts of Indian states like Delhi, Uttar Pradesh, Uttarakhand, Maharashtra, Rajasthan, Bihar and parts of east India felt the tremors twice today.

With the huge damage and loss of lives during the Nepal earthquake on April 25 still playing on their minds, people flooded social media like Facebook and Twitter with photographs and videos of their earthquake experience last month.

The latest updates of today’s earthquake say at least seven people were killed and over 150 were injured in Nepal on Tuesday. Police spokesman Kamal Singh Bam said that four people were killed in Chautara town in Sindhupalchowk district and three people died in capital Kathmandu. He added that the number of deaths is likely to go up, as they await the news from other areas. Dozens of buildings have collapsed in the already devastated Nepal, he said.

The India Meteorological Department official told IANS that the epicentre of the May 12 earthquake was in Nepal and the tremors were felt in north and east India, including Delhi, Guwahati, Lucknow and Jaipur.

Hundreds of panicky people came out of their homes and workplaces and moved on to nearby open spaces.
