KATHMANDU, Nepal: The Nepalese Prime Minister Sushil Koirala has warned that the death toll from Saturday’s 7.8-magnitude earthquake could reach 10,000, and also appealed for foreign supplies of tents and medicines.

On Saturday morning, Nepal witnessed the deadliest disaster in more than 80 years which caused thousands of casualties, destroyed numerous buildings in Kathmandu and severely affected rural areas across the region.

In an interview with a Reuters on Tuesday, Koirala said that the Nepalese government is doing all it can for rescue and relief on a war footing but it is a challenge.

“The government is doing all it can for rescue and relief on a war footing,” Koirala said. “It is a challenge and a very difficult hour for Nepal.”

The Nepal’s home ministry spokesman Laxmi Prasad Dhakal said that a total of 4,310 people have so far been killed while further 7,953 people have been injured.

The massive earthquake and aftershocks also caused deaths to nearly 100 people in neighbouring India and China.

Meanwhile, the International aid and rescue workers have been continuing to arrive at the airport in Kathmandu following the devastating earthquake.
