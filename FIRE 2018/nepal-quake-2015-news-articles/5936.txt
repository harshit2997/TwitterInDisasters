Local students raise money for Nepal

ADA, Okla.--It has been almost a week since the 7.8 magnitude earthquake shook the capital of Nepal, killing more than 5,000 people, and although the earthquake may be thousands of miles away it has effected the lives of people right here in Texoma.

Around 90 students from East Central University are from Nepal, they said when they first heard about the earthquake they knew they needed to do something."

"I thought it was a nightmare," one student said.

"I wanted to see if my family was okay," another student said while standing outside Walmart.

"The first thing that came to my mind was immediately take a plane ticket and go back to Nepal."

With a little over a week till graduation and a plane ticket standing between them and Nepal the students knew going there wasn't the answer.

"I thought that the $1,200 I spend for my plane ticket would be useful for thousands of people getting food out there," an ECU student said.

Nepalese students along with the ECU Rotaract Club came together setting up booths at Walmart and on campus.

"Everyone is grieving for our nation and we're trying to do as much as we can to help it," Nabian Shresta said.

So far they've raised almost $10,000, and even though most of these students are from the country's capital, Katmandu. They want the money to go toward buying food and water for a small remote village.

"What we are doing here as international students is we're focusing on a remote village it's in Sindhupalchok," Hasana Shresta said. "They say their hasn't been any help so we're trying to help."

There's a long way to go, till Nepal is back to normal. Some of the students said their family are still sleeping in the streets afraid of aftershocks. They're just thankful none of their immediate family were injured in the quake.

Next Saturday, the students hope their family will be able to come to Ada to see them graduate and put this tragedy behind them.
