Second group of SA aid workers arrive in Nepal

The second group would be assisting with medical operations in Nepal, after the first group touched down earlier in the week to help with search and rescue efforts.

“Today has been an excellent start for the team. Everything worked out beautifully,” said orthopaedic surgeon Dr Livan Turino.

Turino and his GOTG colleagues were able to operate and meet patients for the first time since their arrival two days ago.

Every GOTG medical mission requires the team to identify areas in need of their services and to ensure they integrate into the existing medical system.

“Any trip we go on, we do not start working immediately. We have to integrate into the current system and we have to find a hospital in need of our services,” said Turino.

However, the Nepal mission required a bit more patience than previous trips as much of the group’s equipment and cargo had been held up at various airports.

Turino said that despite the wait for equipment, the process of registering with the Nepalese department of health, identifying a hospital, and integrating was far quicker than usual.

“The most amazing thing is how welcoming and appreciative everyone is here,” said Turino.

Although the need for medical services was great in Nepal following last Saturday’s earthquake, the country’s worst in 81 years, not all facilities had the requirements needed by the GOTG team.

The medical team spent their first day at a hospital in Nepal where they conducted rounds and operated on three patients.

Turino said it was one of the few times he had experienced local medical staff stepping back to allow GOTG to assist.

“They opened the doors for us. Everything is based on respect and no one is territorial,” he said.

Turino said the hard work was only beginning as survivors in far-flung areas were not yet receiving as much help as needed.

“As soon as they start clearing rubble and further entering the periphery areas, that’s when the hard work will begin”.

The medical team would on Saturday return to the hospital with at least five operations planned and more expected.

They would also look to distribute their services to isolated facilities.

“These people are very humble and we are very happy to work with and serve them,” said Turino.
