Credit unions in Mayo have pledged €50,000 for relief efforts in Nepal.

A major element of the fund, which is being organised in partnership with the Irish League of Credit Unions’ charitable arm, called the International Development Foundation, will go towards supporting the revitalisation of Nepalese credit unions.

The fund will also support staff and members affected by one of the worst natural disasters in recent times, outlined a foundation spokesperson.

More than 7,000 people have now been confirmed dead following the Nepal earthquake on April 25.

Millions of people have also been displaced by the disaster and are in urgent need of food, water, and shelter.

Meanwhile, Oxfam Ireland’s chief executive Jim Clarken said the Mayo public can contribute towards their relief efforts in Nepal by making a donation to the Oxfam shop in Castlebar.

“Although readers of the Mayo Advertiser are thousands of miles away, you can still help. Donating cash or your unwanted goods at your local Oxfam shop means we can respond fast,” he said.

“The sooner we can reach earthquake survivors, the greater the difference we can make. It really is a race against time to save lives.”

The Oxfam shop is located on the Link Road in Castlebar.
