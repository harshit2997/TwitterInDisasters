The Red Cross today more than doubled its emergency assistance to USD 93 million for the quick-hit Nepal to help the victims rebuild their lives as quickly as possible.



The International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC) increased the assistance to help nearly 700,000 earthquake survivors for the next two years, said Elhdj As Sy, secretary general of IFRC.



"We are still in full emergency mode - the task at hand remains expanding our response while also adapting to meet emergency needs. This involves local and international actors pulling together in united effort," Elhdj said.Earlier, the international organisation had allocated USD 36.2 million for the victims of the powerful earthquake."Our aim is to reach at least 500,000 in the coming weeks. People want to rebuild as quickly as possible and a large part of our appeal is designed to enable households to repair or rebuild their own homes," he said.Elhdj said over 221,000 people were currently sheltering under the tents and tarpaulins provided by the international organisation."We will also be channeling support to families so that they can improve their livelihoods through income earning activities and support small enterprise revival," he said.IFRC covers a number of areas including emergency shelter and support for rebuilding homes, food, cash distribution, livelihood support, clean water and improved sanitation as well as basic health services and psychological support.Nepal Red Cross has already mobilised nearly 7,000 volunteers across the country and provided health care services to 17,600 people.Over 8,200 people have been killed in Nepal as a result of a devastating 7.9 earthquake that jolted the country on April 25.Another powerful temblor shook the country this week, killing more than 100 people, dealing another blow to Nepal's severely crippled infrastructure.
