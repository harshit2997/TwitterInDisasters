Angered by "insenstive" coverage of the Great Quake by Indian Media, Twitteratis expressed their distress on the social media platform as #GoHomeIndianMedia started trending on Sunday.

A few days before the Twitter backlash, in a blog published on CNN'S iReport, Sunita Shakya, a non-residential Nepali wrote an open letter to the Indian Media which was widely circulated on Facebook and Twitter. Shakya started by thanking the Indian Media for India's help during the time of crisis. "All the Nepalese in and outside of the country are thankful to your country,' before outlining what she called insensitive coverage. "Your media and media personnel are acting like they are shooting some kind of family serials," she wrote

#GoHomeIndianMedia is about Indian Media. It has nothing to do with Indian Government. Indian Government was the first to reach Nepal+ — Nepali Poet (@npPoet) May 3, 2015

We respect India's efforts and support during the earthquake. Our anger is just towards insensitive reporting #GoHomeIndianMedia — Ichha Lamichhane (@imichha) May 4, 2015

Some have slammed the coverage as a public relations exercise on behalf of the Indian Government.
