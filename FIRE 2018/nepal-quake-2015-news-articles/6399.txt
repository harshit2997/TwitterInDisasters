Yoga teacher works to help destroyed Nepalese village

After experiencing first-hand the devastating earthquake that shook Nepal to its core, Calgarian Tamara McLeod is back in Canada working to raise money for the devastated, South Asian country.

The yoga instructor had a harrowing experience, when, soon after waking up on the morning of April 25, her bed began shaking violently, she said when speaking with Herald a week ago.

McLeod rushed down a flight of stairs and out the door.

“It was a total adrenalin rush, of fear and confusion — my body went into shock, my vision started to get really blurry,” she said.

Now staying with family in Victoria, B.C., McLeod is working to set up the means for Canadians to donate money to help with the rebuilding efforts in Nepal, said her sister, Michelle Dack.

McLeod has already set up a donations webpage at gofundme.com to help support the host family that sheltered her and nine other trekkers when they were in Nepal.

On the donations page, McLeod writes: “The family I was staying with offered me … everything they had. It is because of their kindness that I am here today. Their family home and the village at large were destroyed by the disaster, leaving the people homeless and in dire need of help.”

The donation campaign is her effort to “return the gift” to the family and the village, Briddim, where she stayed in Nepal, she wrote.

Dack said her sister will eventually return to Calgary after raising more money to help with the rebuild.
