A 24-year-old woman has been pulled out alive from the wreckage of a building in Nepal, 128 hours after a deadly 7.9-magnitude tremblor devastated the Himalayan nation.

Krishna Devi Khadka was rescued by a joint team of Nepal Army, Nepal Police and Israeli rescue team from Janasewa Guest House in Gonggabu village on Thursday.

Khadka was buried under the rubbles of the collapsed guest house. She was rescued five days after the deadly earthquake struck the country on Saturday.

Khadkais is the latest miracle survivor after a teenager who was also rescued five day after the earthquake.

Rescuers are still struggling to reach remote mountainous areas in the Himalayan nation, where relief efforts have been hampered by heavy rain and landslide even as global help poured in following the quake that has killed nearly 6,200 people and injured at least 14,000 others.

Officials have warned that they faced problems in getting aid into the country and then delivering it to some of the remote communities in desperate need.

Anger and frustration have mounted in the country that has witnessed scenes of people clashing with police and seizing food and water supplies.

As the rescue and relief operations have become centred in Kathmandu Valley, other affected districts remain in dire need of trained manpower to undertake search activities.
