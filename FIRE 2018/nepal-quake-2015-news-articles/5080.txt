The team of students said they were in an old church at the time of the earthquake and helped rush dozens of people, including children, to safety.

"We were there for not even a day when the earthquake hit," Adam Hollingsworth said.

"We just rushed the kids outside, make sure everybody was OK, because the building was kind of unstable, we didn't want it to collapse on anybody," Wyatt Snyder said.

Hollingsworth, Snyder and the other students were visiting Nepal for mission work.

"Seeing people's worlds completely changed, it was really incredible," Hollingsworth said. "That's the most devastation I've ever witnessed."

The group spent over a week in Nepal, trapped near Katmandu. They traveled to town to help in the cleanup and to distribute water and food.

"On the way back we saw a couple houses collapsed where we were at, it was kind of bad. We got to Katmandu and there was a lot of devastation," Snyder said.

The group slept outside on the ground, which was the safest option.

"We were walking around with a local teacher," Hollingsworth said. "She was showing us, it's a town of 5,000. It was about 95 percent of the houses werejust gone.

Just as they were eager to help, they were also eager to get home.

"Just knowing that God's got these people, God loves them -- that just brought me a whole bunch more comfort," Snyder said.

The students originally went to Nepal to build an Internet Training Center.

Family and friends greeted the group at Omaha's Eppley Airfield.

The team said they had Wi-Fi and were able to let everyone know they had survived, when thousands of people did not.

Students said they couldn't believe their eyes when touring the damage.
