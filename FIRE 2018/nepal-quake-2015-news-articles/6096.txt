Why William and Kate's royal baby may be born under a full moon

As the wait for William and Kate's second royal baby continues, speculation has begun that the little one could make its way into the world on Bank Holiday Monday – the day of the next full moon. There was a full moon on the day that Prince George was born and royal fans are now wondering whether the celestial occurrence could herald the arrival of the Duke and Duchess's second-born.



The Telegraph reports that the full moon might affect when Kate goes into labour as "when there is a full moon, the Sun and Moon are on opposite sides of the Earth, pulling it from both sides."



If you are pregnant, the gravitational forces can pull on your amniotic fluid.

"The Sun weighs 2,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000 tonnes and the Moon weighs 73,430,000,000,000,000,000 tonnes," reports the Telegraph – adding that the weight can have a significant effect on those who are ready to give birth.



The newspaper also spoke to Maddie McMahon, who has been a birthing friend for 12 years, who said that the deliveries she helps with often coincide with a full moon.



"It's certainly busier during a full moon," she said. "I did a tot up last year and I found that 40 per cent of my clients go into labour on a full moon or a new moon when the sky is very dark."

While the nation waits for the news that they royal family has welcomed its newest member, its members have been carrying on with their official duties.



On Friday, Prince William paid his respects to the victims of the Nepal earthquake, visiting the Nepalese Embassy in London to sign their book of condolence.



Kensington Palace tweeted an image of the Duke signing the book, writing: "The Duke of Cambridge has signed a book of condolence for victims of the Nepal earthquake."



The Prince wrote: "With my deepest condolences to the people of Nepal and my thoughts and prayers to all those affected."
