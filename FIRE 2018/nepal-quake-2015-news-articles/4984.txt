Priya Vajpai, mother of Mountaineer Arjun Vajpai, finally heaved a sigh of relief after she got a call from the defence Attaché at Kathmandu, informing her that her son along with fellow mountaineers have been airlifted from the Hillary base camp of Mount Makalu on Sunday afternoon.

“I was informed in the afternoon that Arjun has been safely evacuated from the Hillary base camp and from the army camp in Kathmandu he was taken to Indian Embassy in Nepal. We are eagerly waiting for his return to India now,” said his mother.

Arjun along with about 38 mountaineers including Sherpa were stranded at high base camp in Mount Makalu in Nepal since April 30 when the devastating earthquake rocked the Himalayan region.

After the two failed attempts by the Nepal Army to airlift the mountaineers, the team decided to walk 3,000 feet down to Yangley Kharka.

“Since the Nepal Army was having difficulty to airlift the team at an altitude of 15,750 feet due to bad weather, the team decided to head down at 12,500 feet. The path was damaged due to landslides and some of the fellow mountaineers even sustained minor injuries,” his mother told iamin after she was informed by Arjun.

However, the team had to leave their bags and other tools at the base camp in order to climb down faster.

“At the moment the Indian Embassy at Nepal is arranging his return to India. Since they had to head down in a hurry and had to cover the distance speedily, Arjun had to leave behind his bag which had his mountaineering tools, Documents and Passport. They covered the seven hour stretch in merely two hours,” informed Sanjeev Vajpai, Arjun's father.

Among the rescued fellow mountaineers with Arjun, five climbers were from Spain, two from Austria, three from Belgium and three Sherpa.

Arjun's father thanked the Nepal Army and Indian Embassy at Nepal for coordinating the rescue efforts to evacuate his son and fellow climbers safely.
