Battle to save lives in Nepal not over yet
</headline>

<text>
It is worrying that Nepal had asked foreign search-and-rescue teams to leave the country only nine days after the devastating earthquake (“Quake-stricken Nepal to seek funds from AIIB to rebuild”; May 5).

Many of the 28 million Nepalese live in remote villages, some of which cannot be accessed until roads are restored. About eight million people were displaced, of whom more than 14,000 were injured, and some foreigners remain unaccounted for.

Among the affected, two million need tents, water, food and medicine. The catastrophe could turn into a humanitarian crisis, if it is not already one.

Many of the remaining buildings are unstable. It is uncertain whether surveys have been done to assess the chances of aftershocks and the danger of landslides and floods. Based on an Australian Broadcasting Corporation report, scientists studying satellite images fear that more aftershocks may occur.

The international community should do their utmost to help Nepal assess the whole situation thoroughly, so as to prevent further loss of lives.
