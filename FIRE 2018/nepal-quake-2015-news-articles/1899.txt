KUALA LUMPUR, April 27, 2015:

As death toll rises, Malaysians are lending their hands to Nepal.

MERCY Malaysia responded by deploying its emergency medical team as part of the Malaysian Response team with seven of them ready to be deployed led by MERCY Malaysia Consultant Orthopaedic Surgeon and Traumatologist Dr Heng Aik Cheng.

The Emergency Response Unit team consists of medical personnel, logistics support, doctors, and surgeons, complete with a field hospital set-up to serve the affected communities.

MERCY Malaysia is preparing its medical teams for a sustained medical assistance for at least one month, prioritising efforts in conducting the needs assessments in the areas affected by the earthquake in collaboration with World Health Oraganisation Health Cluster Partnership.

Latest figure shows casualties have reached nearly 4,000 as more rescuers head to the affected areas.

Earlier, Prime Minister’s Special Envoy to South Asia Datuk Seri S. Samy Vellu launched the Nepal Earthquake Relief Mission and kick started the mission’s effort by donating RM10,000.

The mission aimed to collect food, tents, blankets, kitchen sets, drinking water, clothes and medical supplies for the people affected by the earthquake.

Foreign Affairs Ministry spokesperson said so far most Malaysians who were there were accounted for but many faced logistics problem as most roads in that area were badly hit by the Saturday earthquake.

The Malaysian Embassy in Kathmandu has issued an advisory to all Malaysians currently stranded in Nepal and who urgently need to return home.

The advisory also stated that Malindo Air, AirAsiaX and Malaysia Airlines would continue trying to fly in according to their schedule.
