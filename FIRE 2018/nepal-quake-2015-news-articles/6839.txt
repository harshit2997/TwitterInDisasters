A local nurse with strong ties to Nepal is hoping the community can help rebuild the home of a dear friend.

Cara Christiansen is a registered nurse at Kelowna General Hospital. She traveled to Nepal in 2008 and during that time built a special friendship with a local Nepalese man Bhupal Kharel “Agnidev”.

In the devastating magnitude-7.8 quake on April 25, Agnidev's family home was almost entirely destroyed and Christiansen hopes to help them rebuild.

She says the earthquake has left him unable to work and has made getting food and water for his family very challenging.

“His home was damaged enough they could not live in it,” says Christiansen. “They are living under a tree near their home now.”

Christiansen and Agnidev met at Nepalese Ashram and have remained good friends ever since.

“He was also studying at the Ashram,” explains Christiansen. “It was truly beautiful, the people there are amazing. It is a very cool culture with super friendly people.”

Agnidev is now 28-years-old and is the main provider for his large family in Nepal, including his mother, sister and wife.

Christiansen says Agnidev is one of the most selfless people she knows.

“He was in Kathmandu when the first earthquake hit and worked for three days straight saving people from the rubble,” says Christiansen. “He is such a giving person. He is spiritual and is always taking care of others. We developed a really special friendship. He never cares about himself, he only cares about others.”

Christiansen has already sent $300 to Agnidev, with which he was able to start buying building materials for his new home, but he needs more help.

“He is planning to build a stronger house than what they were living in,” says Christiansen. “The houses there are typically made out of mud and wood and things like that, so everyone in Nepal is trying to find new building materials for when it happens again.”

She says knowing how fortunate we are in Canada, she would love to help give back to him and the people and village around him.

Her GoFundMe fundraiser page has already raised over $550 and she hopes to send as much as she can to help them out.
