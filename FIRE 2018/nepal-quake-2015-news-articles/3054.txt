One rescued traveler recounts his ordeal to Arutz Sheva - and praises Chabad's handling of the situation.

Hundreds of Israelis arrived home on Tuesday, during the latest airlift from Nepal. Arutz Sheva spoke to one traveler about his experience during the earthquake.

"It was very scary," Noam Weingarten stated. "We were sitting most of the time in a Chabad house."

Weingarten said that most of the stranded Israelis were focused on locating missing friends, as well as staying alive.

Throughout the ordeal, he said, Chabad "handled it amazingly."

"There was food, shelter for everyone - there were even non-Israelis, non-Jews who came, and [Chabad] gave them food, and they sat with us, and we were trying to make everybody feel better about what's going on."

Weingarten noted that he personally knows some of the missing.

"It's mixed feelings," he said, adding that he wanted to stay and finish the hiking trek he had planned, but that the fact there are still missing Israelis is troubling.

He recounted how he wandered around Kathmandu looking for a Wi-Fi internet connection, and ended up being interviewed by news organizations - but still has not contacted his parents.

"Hey, if I could have contacted my parents, I would have!" he concluded, laughing.
