#NepalQuake: If You Are In India, Here's How You Can Help!
</headline>

<text>
Our beautiful neighbour Nepal is facing its worst disaster in last eight decades.

The landlocked Himalayan country faced two massive earthquakes of the huge maginitudes (Richter scale 7.8 & 6.7) on consecutive days over the weekend. While the first one almost completely ravished the country's capital, Kathmandu, and surrounding regions, the second one on Sunday furthered the destruction. The latest reports from the country suggest that more than 3000 people have perished in the catastrophe with close to 7000 being injured.

Indian government swiftly sprung into action with relief efforts and within the first four hours of the disaster Indian Air Force had already airlifted the first batch of relief supplies.

But as lesser mortals what can we do? We can all contribute in our own ways. Many Indians are already volunteering for rescue efforts while others are donating food, clothes (not old ones please!) and other objects of urgent need through local channels. The largest requirement is for material to create tents and other shelters followed by food and medicine.

Here is a list which will help you locate and donate to your favourite charity which will further your vision for help in Nepal:

Red Cross

Internationally Red Cross has led by example in terms of rescue and relief operation. Also among the chief requirements right now for Nepal, blood ranks highest and Red Cross has the best facilities to get that across to the people in need including a solar powered blood bank in Kathmandu. You can join their ongoing efforts in Nepal right here.

Crowd fund Raising platforms

Many people are coming up on social fund raising platforms to raise funds for relief. Among those is Singapore based fashion designer Prabal Gurung who has joined hands with Nepalese NGO Shikshya Foundation in starting this initiative on Crowdsource.

Meanwhile, people at Goonj have sent out a list of things which can be donated to be used in relief operations in Nepal through their channels and it is almost the best list on what to and what not to store for donations.
