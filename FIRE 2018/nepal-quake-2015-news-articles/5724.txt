VICTIMS and survivors of the Nepal earthquake will be remembered at a candlelight vigil in Moonah tonight.

Hosted by the Nepali Society of Tasmania, the vigil will start at 6pm in Benjafield Park and is expected to draw a large crowd.

Several hundred people gathered in Hobart’s Franklin Square earlier this week to offer their thoughts and prayers to the disaster-struck Nepalese and raise money for the relief effort.

Tasmanian Multicultural Council chairman Alphonse Mulumba today said locals were well known for their generosity and strong sense of community.

“I have no doubt these values will shine through again in response to this tragedy,” he said.

“Whilst we may feel far from those suffering, we must take heart that we can still make a difference.

“As we continue to hear reports of loss, desperation and need over the coming days, it is important not to lose hope.

“Efforts to raise funds have already begun, including the Nepali Society of Tasmania’s collection of donations to assist victims in Nepal.”

Other community support groups including the Bhutanese Community of Southern Tasmania, NRNA Tasmania and the Migrant Resources Centre will also attend the event, to acknowledge those in surrounding countries that were also affected by the 7.9 magnitude earthquake.

The Tasmania University Law Society is holding a bake sale at the Law Faculty next Thursday from noon-2pm to raise money for the relief effort in Nepal, with all proceeds going to the Red Cross.
