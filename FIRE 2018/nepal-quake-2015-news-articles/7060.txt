Student hears voices of terror as new Nepal earthquake strikes

A YOUNG woman who lost her mother in last month’s Nepal earthquake has told how her sister screamed in terror down the phone as the country’s second major quake struck.

Deeside Coleg Cambria student Maya Shyangba Hyolmo was due to fly out on Wednesday to be with her father, Kaji Lama, following the death of her mother, Jangmu Sherpa, after the devastating quake on April 25.

But her sister, Nimadikil Lama, has urged Maya not to travel, saying it is far too dangerous.

After news of the second quake yesterday, Maya, 30, telephoned her younger sister, who had flown in to Khatmandu to be with her father and loved ones the day before.

She said: “My sister was running through the field, crying, shouting down the phone to me ‘it’s coming, it’s coming’.

“I panicked. I could hear the shaking and other people screaming.

“I managed to speak to my sister again afterwards and thankfully she was safe, but she told me not to fly out because it is too dangerous.

“Now I just have to wait and see when it is safe to fly – but I need to get to my father as soon as possible so I can help him.”

The first earthquake claimed the lives of more than 8,000 people.

The second, measuring 7.3 on the Richter Scale, hit a town close to Mount Everest, about 60 miles from Maya’s village, Sarka Thali Helambu, where her father and teenage brother still remain.

Maya, who lives with her husband Michael in Hoole, Chester, has also since heard from her uncle, who told her her father was safe and was sheltering under a tent along with fellow villagers.

Maya, added: “I’m so confused as to what to do. I just know that I need to reach my father and help him to recover and rebuild his life, and to grieve for my mother.

“Eventually I want to bring my father back to the UK to stay with me. I’m the eldest child and I want to look after him.”

Once she has flown to Nepal, Maya will remain for a number of weeks to participate in a ritual ceremony for her late mother.
