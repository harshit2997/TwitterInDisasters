Local Resident Stranded in Nepal Shares His Experience

Ruston, LA -- On April 25th, a natural disaster left a local group of four traveling stranded in the South Asian country of Nepal.



"All of a sudden the earth..Boom!" says Doug Walton/ Earthquake Survivor.



Louisiana Tech art professor, Doug Walton, and his companions were in Nepal for an art trip.



They had just finished what would be their last meal for nearly a week when boulders came crashing down around them.



"Within minutes the streets were filled with six feet of boulders, some bigger than cars. And it was also clear that we had to get out quickly," says Doug Walton/ Earthquake Survivor.



They were in the center of a 7.8 magnitude earthquake -- one of the worst ever recorded in Nepal.



The quake left thousands dead and many others trapped in villages for weeks with little food or water.



"That first night was tough because there was still sever after shocks. It was raining, 40 degrees, and we simply had no concept of what was going to lie ahead. And then within an hour of darkness the mountain across from us collapsed and all you could hear was this thunderous roar," says Doug Walton/ Earthquake Survivor.



Now back in the states, Walton calls the experience nothing short of life-changing.



"You had to simply trust and believe that which we needed would be provided. And it turns out that we had nothing but we had everything. That turns out to be one of the most beautiful experiences of my entire lifetime," says Doug Walton/ Earthquake Survivor.



He says it brought out some of his best art work because of the joy and appreciation people had for life.



"The more I started drawing the more I saw and the more you observe the people. You realize there was not a sadness. A beautiful acceptance," says Doug Walton/ Earthquake Survivor.



Walton says he and his companions are the last to have seen some of Nepal's historic structures just before they crumbled.



"We were the last group ever to draw many of those temples that no longer exist. So we can bring a perspective to all this that others cannot," says Doug Walton/ Earthquake Survivor.



Walton's art is all that is left of parts of Nepal and he hopes he can create a new beginning for those still suffering.



"So somehow our story needs to be said through paintings and some even said a traveling exhibit. I think it should be a major museum exhibit. It's not the end. It's what will happen to those 450 drawings and the hundreds of drawings that my students did," says Doug Walton/ Earthquake Survivor.
