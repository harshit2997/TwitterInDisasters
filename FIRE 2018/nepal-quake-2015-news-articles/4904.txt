Among the many individuals and organisations providing help to Nepal earthquake victims, a few NGOs from Maharashtra have reached Nepal to provide aid to the injured animals there. Approximately, 5,000 animals are injured in the disaster and are being treated by Animal NGOs – PAWS, Dombivali, Shri Ramanugrah trust, Mumbai and PFA from Pune.



PAWS Dombivali, PFA Pune and Shri Ramanugrah Trust Mumbai have teamed up with NGOS from Nepal – Animal Nepal and Street Dog Care, Nepal to provide greater assistance to the affected animals. PAWS has collected medicines and other materials for these NGOs and in addition to this, a team trained in disaster management will stay in Nepal for a week.



PAWS founder Nilesh Bhanage said, “PAWS tries to help animals in distress during such natural calamities. Animals that have survived the earthquake face a lot of difficulties such as lack of food and veterinary care.”



PFA Pune founder Manoj Oswal said, “We aim to assist the animal NGOS in Nepal in providing them basic necessities and care to the rescued animals.” Omkar Rane of Shri Ramanugrah trust is also a part of the team being sent to Nepal.



Most of the animals affected by the earthquake are domestic animals and constitute the livelihood of many people. Hence, it is also important for the welfare of the people that animal aid is provided in a timely manner to ensure the survival of these animals, that face many challenges such as, exposure to rain, respiratory stress, lack of food etc.
