More than $450,000 raised for Nepal

New Zealanders have donated more than $450,000 to World Vision's Nepal earthquake appeal, and the national chief executive said he expects other major aid organisations to have raised the same.

World Vision chief executive Chris Clarke told TV3 this morning he was "blown away" by how much New Zealanders have donated to Nepal.

"This comes on top of the fact that just two weeks ago we were raising money for Cyclone Pam."

He said the response showed the "extraordinary generosity of New Zealanders".

"I think in this case its because it's Nepal," he said.

New Zealanders felt connected to the country through the family of Sir Edmund Hillary, Mr Clarke said, and because we live in a similarly mountainous country.

Many of the donations were coming from Christchurch, Mr Clarke said.

The money was being used to distribute tarpaulins, emergency supplies, food and water.

"It will be two to three more weeks until we start to look at recovery stage... how do we start to rebuild the lives of Nepalese people?"

Nepal's government has faced criticism for delays in getting aid distributed across the country.

Mr Clarke said the limited infrastructure in the poor country had made the aid operation challenging.

He said some of the communities his staff knew well been wiped out, and these places often took staff a flight and three days walk to reach.

While aid operations were underway for the country's vulnerable people, it was hard for Mr Clarke to see helicopters being used to transport foreign climbers to safety.

"It's really hard for us as aid workers because there's only a certain amount of helicopters and they're helicopters that we could use to distribute food and they're being used to bring down climbers," he said.

Mr Clarke is a climber, and said the situation was "something of the paradox we live in".

The magnitude 7.8 earthquake struck the central and western regions on Saturday.

So far the government has said the toll from the tremor had risen to 6130 dead and 13,827 injured.
