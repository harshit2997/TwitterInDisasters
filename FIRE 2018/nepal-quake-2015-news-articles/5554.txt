PULLMAN, WA - Next week, the Nepali Student Association of Washington State University will send thousands of dollars to Nepal.



The money will go to International Aide Organizations like Mercy Corps and Save The Children.



On April 25th an earthquake hit Nepal, killing over 7,000 people. The UN Humanitarian office says the earthquake demolished more than 130,000 homes.



"They work all their lives just to get one house, you know, to build a house," said Ashish Bhattarai, President of Nepali Student Association at WSU. "And it's all destroyed and you can't really I mean, this is the least we could do."



So far the Nepali Student Association has raised about $8,000.
