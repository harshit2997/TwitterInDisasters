Nepal's MP Jagdeshwari Narsingh accompanied Revered Saint Gurmeet Ram Rahim Singh Ji Insan during this visit. Volunteers constructed tents for the homeless, along with distributing essential items like milk powder, red chili powder, candle, sugar, turmeric powder, salt, rice, wheat flour, refined edible oil, plates, cooker etc., to the earthquake victims. And a medical team of 35 doctors provided medical services to the needy, by setting up check-up camps in the affected areas.

The Home Ministry of Nepal assigned the task of rehabilitating Vidhur Tehsil in Nuwakot District. As part of this task, Saint Gurmeet Ram Rahim Singh Ji Insan revamped and reconstructed two schools in the area, apart from providing tents and relief material. The first school was Shree Shahid Jagat Prakash Jung Shah Sanskrit Secondary School (Devighat) in Nuwakot District.
