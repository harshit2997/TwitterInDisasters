Three days after the April 25 earthquake, Vigeant, a personal historian and owner of Legacy Preserves, launched a group called Midcoast Maine Loves Nepal. Vigeant was in Nepal in 2012 documenting a story about inter-caste marriage and developed friendships in the Kathmandu and Chitwan valleys during her stay.



After the slide talk at the library, the public is invited to dine at participating restaurants for Eat for Nepal week. Restaurants from Rockland to Belfast have teamed up to donate 10% of their profits for one day each during the week of May 17 to 23 to help the earthquake victims. Proceeds from Eat for Nepal will go to the Nepal Youth Foundation. Currently, the roster of participating restaurants are Rockland's In Good Company, 3Crow, Rock City Café, and Home Kitchen Café; Camden's 40 Paper, Boynton-McKay, and Fresh; and Belfast's La Vida and Del Vino's. Camden Public Library will host a slideshow talk on Sunday, May 17, at 2 p.m. on "Nepal, Before and After the Earthquake," featuring photos by Meghan Vigeant and other photographers from recent trips to Nepal, combined with post-earthquake images from a photography group based in Kathmandu that Vigeant has been in contact with. The slide talk is the kick-off event for Eat for Nepal, a weeklong fundraising effort by area restaurants to help the victims of the Nepal earthquake.Three days after the April 25 earthquake, Vigeant, a personal historian and owner of Legacy Preserves, launched a group called Midcoast Maine Loves Nepal.
