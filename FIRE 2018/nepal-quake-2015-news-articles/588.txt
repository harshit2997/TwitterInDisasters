Earthquake in Nepal: How you can help
</headline>

<text>
As the death toll continues to rise from Saturday's 7.8-magnitude earthquake in Nepal, aid organizations in Oregon and around the globe are mobilizing to help.

Wondering how you can help? Here is a list of some reputable groups , both local and international, that are offering aid:

The Nepali Association of Oregon is accepting donations, which will be sent to Nepal to help earthquake victims.

Portland-based Mercy Corps is also collecting donations, which will go toward on-the-ground efforts in Nepal.

Cupcake Jones -- a bakery in the Pearl District and on Northeast Alberta Street -- is donating 5 percent of its sales this weekend to Mercy Corp.

Outside the state:

Fashion designer Prabal Gurung has created a crowdfunding campaign to raise money for the relief effort.

Oxfam is accepting donations as it prepares to organize relief efforts in Nepal.

World Vision seeks donations for its relief efforts, too. "Initial needs are potable water, food, household supplies, temporary shelter, and protection for children," the organization's website states.

Save the Children plans to spend most money donated in response to the earthquake on immediate needs, while reserving 10 percent of each donation "to help us prepare for the next emergency."

UNICEF, the United Nations International Children's Emergency Fund, has workers on the ground in Nepal.

CARE also has relief workers working in Nepal.
