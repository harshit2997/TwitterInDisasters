A 102-yr-old recalls the monster earthquake of 1934

KATHMANDU: You've to be up real close to Hem Prasad Timilsina for him to hear you. He's 102, but there's something else that marks Timilsina as a unique man in Nepal. He is perhaps the only one who vividly remembers the earthquake of 1934 , a monster 8.4 magnitude temblor that left 4,300 people dead and roughly one-fourth of Kathmandu's houses in ruins 81 years ago.Timilsina, a sprightly young 21 that year, used to live in Gorkha those days, the epicentre of Saturday's quake."The ghanta-ghar was totally destroyed," he told TOI Wednesday, seated on a plastic chair in one of the tents for those too scared to go home. "But all nine members of my family were safe," he added, looking elsewhere as he can't see too well."I was in my sugarcane field at the time of the earthquake," the old man said as people in the camp in the centre of Kathmandu gathered to hear his story for the umpteenth time. "When we heard about the destruction the calamity had wreaked in Kathmandu, we walked for two days to reach here, just to marvel at what had happened. There was no system of public transport those days. You could count on your fingers the number of cars in Nepal, all owned by the rulers."Timilsina pauses to catch his breath. "New Road was in really bad shape. Asan had been severely hit too. On our way to Kathmandu, we had stopped by Dhading and Nuakot to check. It was bad all around," he continues.Just like this time, he recalled that people had, that year, eight decades ago, gathered in large numbers for shelter at Tundikhel, Kathmandu's giant open area which now has about 24,000 temporary quake refugees huddled in maybe 1,300-1,500 tents. "But there weren't too many aftershocks," he said, before adding, "The government didn't do much then either."
