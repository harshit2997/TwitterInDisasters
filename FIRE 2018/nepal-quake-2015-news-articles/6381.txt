BIDDEFORD, Maine (NECN) -- Seven teenagers on a mission trip to Nepal narrowly escaped the country before the second earthquake hit on Tuesday.

The group from 360 Maine was on a mission trip, sponsored by a church in Biddeford. They spent two months in Nepal, and were there for the first earthquake in late April.

Instead of trying to evacuate, they decided they wanted to extend their mission trip, and help.

"It was very sad, but it also raised a sense of urgency," said team leader Garett Collins.

The group put out a plea online, asking for money to be donated through a GoFundMe account. They raised about $3,500 dollars and were able to rent a bus and send 8,000 pounds of food to a remote village where no other aid had been delivered.

Collins said the donation helped feed 100 families for weeks.

"It also helped to just cope with what happened," said team member Ben Hichens, "to know that we didn't go there and just do nothing. We were there to make a difference."

The teens ended up staying two weeks longer than originally planned, and flew back to Maine Sunday night.

When they learned about the second earthquake that hit Tuesday morning, they were devastated.

"You've made a connection with someone you won't forget for the rest of your life, but you don't know what happened to them," said team member Julia Howard.

"Hearing that some of the villages we went to, and some of the people there are gone, that was really hard to hear," said Hichens.

The mission group plans send more people to Nepal in the years to come. They said there will be an on-going need to help the nation rebuild, and they want to be there for that work.

In the meantime, they have set up an online fundraising page to send food and supplies to Nepal. It can be found at together4nepal.org
