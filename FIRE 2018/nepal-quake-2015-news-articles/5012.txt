NNA - U.S. transport aircraft were to begin shuttling rescue teams and supplies Monday to remote areas of Nepal that are desperately awaiting aid, nine days after a devastating earthquake that killed more than 7,300 people.The arrival late Sunday in Kathmandu of the United States Air Force C-17 aircraft and four tilt-rotor Ospreys gave another much-needed shot in the arm to the aid effort after a 101-year-old man was pulled alive from his ruined home.An American general said pilots would begin flying sorties out of the capital Kathmandu to remote areas on Monday morning."They're going to make an immediate difference," U.S. Brigadier General Paul Kennedy told reporters late Sunday."We've got search and rescue teams waiting to go out to the remote areas, we've got relief supplies, especially shelters."Most people don't understand that a shelter is the most pressing need, so we're going to take these things out starting tomorrow (Monday) morning," Kennedy added."The hope is that the sorties start today," an unnamed US embassy official confirmed to AFP on Monday.While the latest official death toll for Nepal stood at 7,250, with some 14,000 injured, authorities warned the final tally would be much higher. More than 100 people were also killed in neighbouring India and China.A Nepalese official said the U.S. aircraft would also airlift victims out of remote areas which experienced some of the worst devastation of the 7.8-magnitude quake on April 25."They are also assisting any casualties in mostly the eastern side of Nepal... places worst hit like Sindhupalchowk, Gorkha area," Suraya Prasad Silwal, a spokesman for Nepal's home ministry, told AFP.==================A.A.M
