The External Affairs Ministry has suggested to Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar to defer his visit to Nepal and undertake it at a "more opportune" time.

Kumar himself avoided comment on the issue. "This smacks of politics of BJP even in relief work being carried out for earthquake victims," JD(U) General Secretary K C Tyagi said

"We'll raise the issue in Parliament and seek a reply from External Affairs Minister Sushma Swaraj as reason for suggesting Nitish Kumar not to go to Janakpur in Nepal to express solidarity with earthquake victims," Tyagi said.

"Information regarding Kumar's programme to Janakpur was given to Nepal as well Central government in advance. Nepal has no objection to his visit so what is the problem of the Central government," he asked.

Bihar has been the hub of relief work carried by the Centre as well state government for earthquake victims in the Himalayan country.

Many Union ministers visited Bihar in this connection and the state government joined hands with them to lessen the plight of earthquake victims, Tyagi said.

Even Nitish Kumar has appreciated Centre's relief initiative for earthquake victims. Kumar wanted to go to Janakpur to express solidarity with people there majority of whom have origin in Bihar, he said.

"There seems to be politics in asking Nitish Kumar not to go to Nepal," Tyagi said.

State JD(U) spokesman Sanjay Singh attacked the Centre and said this reflected "inferior quality of politics" of the BJP.

The step to ask the CM not to visit Nepal appeared driven by "fear" that Kumar would gain all publicity which the BJP did not want, Singh said.
