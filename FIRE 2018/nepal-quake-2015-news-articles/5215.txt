GURKHAS desperate to support relief efforts following the devastating earthquake in their homeland have raised £32,000 in one day in York.

Soldiers from 246 Gurkha Signals Squadron, based at York's Imphal Barracks, took to the streets during the Tour de Yorkshire on Saturday, and visited shopping centres to raise funds to support those suffering in Nepal.

An estimated 7,000 people are believed to have been killed since the earthquake struck on April 26, but a huge international aid mission has seen millions of pounds raised to support the stricken victims.

The Gurkhas collected money at York Designer Outlet, Tesco at Clifton Moor, Coppergate Square and York train station on behalf of the Disaster Emergency Committee (DEC), the principal charity supporting the relief effort in Nepal.

In a letter written to The Press, Captain Tom Aldred, operations officer, thanked the people of York for their donations.

He said: "It is thanks to the helpfulness of the management at each location and the tremendous generosity of the people of York that we were able to raise such a fantastic amount.

"It was a truly humbling experience to see people going out of their way to support people suffering on the other side of the world.

"All of the soldiers of 2 Signal Regiment have been deeply affected by the recent events in Nepal; one quarter of the regiment are Gurkha soldiers and are recruited directly from Nepal.

"As soon as news of the disaster came through, many soldiers have been keen to help raise money to assist them. In fact, all of the soldiers fundraising on Saturday volunteered to give up their weekend to help.

"I also acknowledge that Saturday was probably one of the busiest days of the year for the shops, with the combination of a bank holiday weekend and the Tour de Yorkshire.

"The members of 2 Signal Regiment and the people of Nepal will be forever grateful."
