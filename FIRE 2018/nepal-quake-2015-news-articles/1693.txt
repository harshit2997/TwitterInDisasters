Singapore, April 27 (IANS) All the 68 mosques around Singapore will collect donations for victims of the Nepal earthquake from the public from Tuesday, the Rahmatan Lil Alamin Foundation (RLAF) said on Monday.

RLAF was set up by the Majlis Ugama Islam Singapura (MUIS), also known as the Islamic Religious Council of Singapore, in 2005 for the Singaporean Muslim community to radiate compassion and blessings to poor, needy and victims of disasters regardless of faith, race or creed, according to the introduction on its website.

According to RLAF, all local mosques will receive donations, either in cash or cheque from Tuesday, Xinhua news agency reported. People can also go to the MUIS website to donate online.

Donation boxes marked "Special Collection for Nepal" will also be placed at all the 68 mosques in Singapore from May 1 to 7, it added.

"All proceeds from the collection will be handed over to Mercy Relief which is sending over a team to deliver urgent help on the ground to affected victims," RLAF said.
