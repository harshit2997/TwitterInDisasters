NZ'ers raise over $350,000 for the Himalayan Trust

New Zealanders raise over $350,000 for the Himalayan Trust’s Nepal Rebuild Appeal

The Himalayan Trust has been overwhelmed by the generosity of New Zealanders as their Appeal now reaches over $350,000 in public donations. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade has also contributed $50,000 towards the fund.

Funds raised will be spent working with local communities in the Solukhumbu region (the area around Mt Everest) to help them rebuild their villages badly damaged by the earthquake. They have a team on the ground assessing the damage and determining the priorities for a rebuild of schools and hospitals.

They are also involved in the relief efforts, providing tents and tarpaulins, wet weather and cold weather gear. There is a desperate need in the many villages where people have no shelter, especially with the monsoon season soon approaching. However, there are huge logistical challenges getting help to vulnerable people in remote areas. Congestion at Nepal’s only international airport, roads blocked by landslides and fuel shortages are making it difficult to transport aid to scattered communities across difficult mountainous terrain. The Trust is doing everything it can to reach people.

The Himalayan Trust needs funds. Nepal is one of the world’s poorest countries and does not have the infrastructure and resources to deal with a crisis of this magnitude. While the response to the disaster has been overwhelming, much more to address the significant level of destruction.

Please support the Rebuild Appeal by donating at www.himalayantrust.org.
