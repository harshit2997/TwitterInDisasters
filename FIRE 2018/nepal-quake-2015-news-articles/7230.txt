UK Government orders return of RAF chinooks sent to help after Nepal earthquake
</headline>

The UK Government has called back three RAF chinooks (not pictured) sent to help Nepal

The military helicopters were deployed by David Cameron two weeks ago to help the aid effort in the earthquake-stricken region.

But instead of being allowed to assist, the heavy-lift aircrafts were apparently left STUCK in neighbouring India.

The denial of entry is said to have happened after the Nepalese government grew worried that the powerful chinooks would blow roofs off fragile houses when taking off or landing, according to Sky News.

Other reports suggest that India and China are concerned about foreign militaries flying close to their airspace.

The Chinooks, along with 100 personnel, are said to have been stranded at Chandigarh Airbase north of Delhi since May 1.
