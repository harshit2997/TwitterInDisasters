Local Nepalese community calls for donations

INDIANAPOLIS (WISH) — The Nepalese community here in Indianapolis is doing its part to raise awareness for that deadly earthquake that’s left nearly 4,000 people dead.

They say they want to do everything they can to help their friends and family back home survive and to do that, they must act quickly.

“Four in the morning, I got the phone call from Nepal and then they say it’s just a big earthquake,” said Ramhari Neupane, president of the Nepalese Association of Indiana.

Neupane waited ten agonizing hours to hear from his family back in Nepal.

“It was really really bad,” he said.

They are okay but much of his hometown is not.

“Those are my family members,” he said pointing to a photograph. “And those are our temples, which we go to (pray), and right now I think most of them (are broken) down.”

The images are haunting, but to the small Nepalese community in central Indiana, they’re painful.

They’ve come together to bring awareness to the situation in their country, which has killed nearly 4,000 people and left countless homeless and injured.

Right now the relief efforts are focused on the essentials.

“They don’t have food, they don’t have shelter, no tent, no house, nothing, you know. That’s the situation,” he said.

That means cash is the best way to help.

The Red Cross of Indiana says they’re working on partnering with local organizations, while the national Red Cross has pledged $300,000 to the relief effort.

The NAI hopes to raise $10,000 in the next two weeks, as well as form partnerships with larger aid organizations.

They’ve raised nearly $4,000 so far and hope to be able to provide some relief soon.

“It’s really really tough right now, just really really suffering, the people there,” he said.
