Songs and prayers were raised above the words "Pray for Nepal," written in candlelight.

The vigil included hymns from a high Hindu priest, as well as prayers offered by both Buddhist priest and a Christian pastor, all brought together by the Bhutanese community of New Hampshire and other groups impacted by the earthquake overseas.

Lawmakers joined to light candles, and the Red Cross came to offer support.

There are many people from Nepal who live, work and go to school in New Hampshire and they say their hearts are in their homeland.

Subash Shretha found out his family in Nepal survived.

“All my family members are over there and I’m praying to God to help them you know,” said Shretha.

One woman said she was crying for two days because she could not reach her family or anyone in Nepal.

Rada Thapa, who was a teacher in Nepal and is currently a teacher in New Hampshire, found out her family is safe, but said that her heart is still broken.

“All my family is in Nepal, and I have lost one of my students. Simply a prayer -- that’s all we can do because we are so far,” said Radha.

New Hampshire Technical Institute Students from Nepal also attended the vigil and said that they are raising money to help.

“It’s very heartbreaking. It’s tough -- we want to go and help, but with the situation, we can’t,” said Prassanna Shrestha, an NHTI student.

So from here, this New Hampshire community leans on each other and promises support in the difficult days ahead.
