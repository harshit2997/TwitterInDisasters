Coming to the aid of earthquake- hit Nepal, state-owned Indian Oil Corp (IOC) has moved large volumes of petrol, diesel, ATF and LPG into the Himalayan nation to meet its fuel demand.



Petrol, diesel, LPG and aviation turbine fuel (ATF) are being supplied to Nepal using truck tankers from Raxaul in Bihar.



"Since April 27, nearly 17,000 kilolitres (kl) of petroleum products, including ATF, petrol and diesel, and over 3,700 tonnes of LPG has been moved from different supply points of IOC into Nepal," the company said in a statement.Transport fuels have yesterday been moved to 100 petrol pumps in Kathmandu valley."IOC has pulled out all stops in a bid to boost relief efforts and fuel the rescue operations in Nepal. A team of senior officials is already camping in Kathmandu to liaise with Nepal Oil Corporation (NOC) and ensure that adequate quantities of fuel are moved to the earthquake-ravaged country on a daily basis," the statement said.Its team is also in the process of assessing the damage to the petroleum installations in Nepal and extending technical assistance, if necessary."NOC has confirmed that there is no shortage or disruption in supplies of essential petroleum products in the country," the statement said.IOC said road routes for movement of petroleum products from its bulk storage depot at Raxaul to Amlekhganj and Kathmandu in Nepal are operational."As per available information, sufficient stocks of petroleum products are available at Amlekhganj depot of NOC," the statement said.IOC said it has also stocked adequate quantities of all petroleum products at its Raxaul bulk depot and other locations that normally cater to Nepal. They will be moved into Nepal as and when necessary, and the stocks are being further augmented on a continuous basis to meet any increase in demand in the coming days.Also, sufficient stocks of ATF are available at IOC's aviation fuel stations (AFS) at Gorakhpur and Hindon to meet the enhanced requirements of the Indian Air Force for rescue and relief operations.Nepal gets all its petroleum products from India as part of a Government-to-Government understanding. IOC supplies over a million tonnes of bulk fuels to Nepal annually that mainly comprise ATF, petrol, diesel and LPG, which are retailed within the country by NOC.
