● ADF to airlift Aussies out of Nepal

● Call for Hunter help after Nepalese village devastated

IT was a 20-second phone call from the highest point on the planet that had a few worried souls in Newcastle jumping for the sky.



Ever since the massive earthquake ripped apart Nepal, the families of three Novocastrians worked feverishly to find out if their loved ones were safe.

Peter Cossar, two tour mates, Liam Buxton and Nick McLennan.

Liam Buxton, Peter Cossar and Nick McLennan had left on April 17 for a trip of a lifetime, spending 13 days trekking from Lukla to the base camp at Mt Everest with a posse of other adventurers.

They were believed to be just one day away from reaching the base camp when the quake struck. It is believed 19 climbers died.

The death toll from the quake had risen to 3300 on Monday night.

Mr Buxton's girlfriend, Holly Ulmer, spoke on Monday of receiving the 20-second phone call from her boyfriend to say that he was safe.

"Twenty four hours later and he could have been one of the people who were horribly affected," Ms Ulmer said. "It was horrible, just not knowing whether or not they were OK. I spoke to the tour company in the early hours of Sunday morning and they advised that everyone on that tour had been accounted for.

"Then at 11pm last night I got a short, 20-second phone call from Liam. He had used someone's satellite phone to say they were in Namche Bazaar.

"They're all very shaken up but thankfully everyone is fine on his tour group."

Mr Buxton told the Newcastle Herald on Monday night that although things were still "a bit chaotic" they were all safe.

"Still stuck in the Himalayas trying to get out of Nepal to a neighbouring country," he wrote to the Herald.

The trio spent Sunday night in a refugee camp.

Mr McLennan's partner, Angela Wright, told the Herald the three mates had made phone calls to loved ones to let them know they were alive.

"We were jumping up and down, there were a lot of happy tears," Ms Wright said.

The trio were looking at flying to Kathmandu and organising an international flight home.
