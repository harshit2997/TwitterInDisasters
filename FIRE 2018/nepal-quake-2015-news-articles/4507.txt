Magnolia-- A candlelight vigil was held Tuesday night on Southern Arkansas University's campus to remember those victims affected by the Nepal Earthquake.



"We are gathering tonight to pay our respects to the victim's of Earthquake in Nepal, and India, China, Bangladesh, were effected too. So we are trying to raise some funds and just stay together," says Shrijana Malakr, SAU Staff and Nepal Native.



All of the students at SAU who are from Nepal say they've communicated with families and all are okay.



"We do know that immediate families are okay, but you know there is some property damage, and there may be extended family who got hurt," says Malakr.



These students have come together for each other during this time and are thankful for the support from the university.



"I would like to thank SAU and our community members to coming out here tonight and supporting us. And we miss our families, I know all of our students here miss our families, and we just want to help," says Malakr.
