UNI hosts candlelight vigil for Nepal - KWWL - Eastern Iowa Breaking News, Weather, Closings
</headline>

<text>
Wednesday evening, students at the University of Northern Iowa who were originally from Nepal hosted a vigil for their friends and family back home.



An earthquake struck Nepal with a magnitude of 7.8, affecting over 6.6 million people in Nepal, India, Bangladesh, China's region of Tibet and Pakistan.



Over 100 students and community members gathered together to pray for those affected by the earthquake and donate.



For those who did not have the chance to make it to the vigil, the students, the International Students and Scholars office and the Wesley Foundation will be accepting donations such as blankets, tents, non-perishable food items and anything else that will benefit the people in need.



You can take those items to the International Students and Scholars office at UNI.
