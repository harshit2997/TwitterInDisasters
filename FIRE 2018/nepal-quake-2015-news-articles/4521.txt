Pictures: Staffordshire trekker caught up in Nepal earthquake describes chaos in the aftermath

Mark Williams is stuck in Thame and said, while the village is in chaos, the doors to a luxury hotel remain closed to the desperate community.

The 7.8-magnitude quake hit on Saturday, with the death toll now at 4,400 and around 8 million people affected, with more than 1.4m needing food assistance.

Updating the situation online, Mr Williams said the small sherpa village 'is almost completely destroyed'.

"My problems are of course nothing compared to those of the locals who are showing great courage and determination."

"The villages of Thame and Upper Thame have been devastated. So far not one relief mission has arrived and all the homes are uninhabitable.

"It's now cold, and raining. The local population desperately need better quality temporary shelters and much more help."

A number of helicopters have flown into Thame to evacuate guests from the luxury Yeti Mountain Home, Mr Williams said.

He claims the hotel is the only building left habitable in the village and is still fully staffed and stocked with food.

"The doors of the Yeti Mountain Home are closed to the local population. They are also closed to stranded trekkers. Unable to pay the exorbitant prices they demanded we begged to sleep on the floor of their lobby. The manager refused. He then wanted to sell us helicopter seats out for $1,000 each. A local family gave us one of their small tents so they now only have one."

The 51-year-old was on a trekking expedition when the quake hit, and was initially listed by the Red Cross as missing.

He managed to make contact with his family early Monday morning and said: "My little crew of two and I were the highest up the Thame valley preparing to cross the Renjo La Pass when the quake hit. It was enormous and struck when we had stopped for tea, demolishing half the building we were in but harming no one. Soberingly the area where I had changed my trousers two minutes earlier collapsed first.

"Yesterday we walked down from Lumde, we were planning to continue down further today but feel the trail is too dangerous because of landslides and huge aftershocks."

Across central Nepal hundreds of thousands of people are still living in the open without clean water or sanitation.

Also waiting to come home are Gareth Douglas from Bridgnorth and former Wolverhampton Girls' High student Rosie Hazeldine.

The United Nations is releasing Â£9.8 million ($15 million) from its central emergency response fund for quake victims.
