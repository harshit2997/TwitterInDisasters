NEPAL QUAKE: Hampshire explorer brings aid to victims
</headline>

<text>
A HAMPSHIRE adventurer has abandoned his latest expedition in Nepal to help distribute aid to communities devastated by the earthquake.

Adrian Hayes has vowed to do all he can to help people living in some of Nepal’s most remote villages after the one of the worst quakes recorded in the region.

The New Forest dad-of-two had travelled to Nepal as part of a challenge to climb five of the world’s highest mountains.

He planned to scale the 8,481-metre Makalu and neighbouring 8,156-metre Lhotse, having climbed K2 – the world’s second highest peak at 8,611 metres – last year.

But Adrian’s plans were put on hold after the 7.8-magnitude quake shook Nepal on Saturday as he climbed Makalu.

The quake triggered avalanches across the region, leaving more than 200 climbers stranded on Everest, just 12 miles away.

Now the professional adventurer and former Gurkha officer, who speaks Nepalese, has cancelled the rest of the expedition and will instead trek across Nepal to help people stranded in some of the most remote villages that other aid missions are unlikely to reach.

He will spend days trekking across the hills and mountains with limited equipment and just one guide to provide medical and practical assistance, report damage to homes to the Gurkha Welfare Trust and call for help if anyone is trapped or badly injured using his Thuraya satellite phone.

Adrian said: “I had already decided a few days ago that it was a bit selfish to carry on so I would rather use my skills to try and help the country. If I can save one villager’s life or get support to one village then it’s worthwhile.”

Meanwhile, more than 100 other British survivors who were caught up in the earthquake have begun making their way home.

Among them was Louise Lock from the New Forest who arrived back in Hampshire on Wednesday night. The University of Winchester student teacher said: “I feel extremely grateful to be alive.”
