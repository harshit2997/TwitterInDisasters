MANILA, Philippines – The Philippine Red Cross deployed 13 members of its Search and Rescue (SAR) team to Nepal on Wednesday, April 29, 2015 to assist in the detection and retrieval of survivors or bodies.

On April 25, a 7.8 magnitude earthquake ripped through Nepal, killing at least 7,000 individuals. According to government reports, the figure is bound to climb ‘much higher’ as rescue teams slowly reach areas isolated due to the earthquake.

Food, water, and medicine are among the survivor’s immediate needs.

According to Ranny Magno, assistant team leader of the delegation, they are the first SAR team to work with the UN International Search and Rescue Advisory group in the immediate aftermath of the Nepal earthquake. Magno is also the Fire Chief of the Subic Bay Metropolitan Authority Search and Rescue Team.

Gwendolyn Pang, secretary general of the Philippine Red Cross said that along with the team are 12 water and sanitation experts. She highlighted that the Philippines is returning the favor for the help extended to the country after Haiyan.

"We were also in our darkest moments but they also came in to support us so we would like to give back," Pang said in a statement.

Many of the deployed Filipino aid workers took part in the local relief and recovery efforts during the aftermath of super typhoon Yolanda, the strongest storm ever to make landfall in the Philippines.

Upon arrival at Kathmandu on Friday, May 1, the Philippine Red Cross SAR team embedded with the UN on-site operations coordination center (OSOCC) along with hundreds of international rescue teams. Together with the Chinese, Malaysian and Russian rescue teams, they spent two days conducting search and operations at the province of Dhading.

The province of Dhading is 4 hours away from the country's capital city. The road to Dhading is zig-zagged and rough.

The self-sufficient team will conduct Post Disaster Assessment Operations for 4 days with the American Red Cross outside of Kathmandu. - Rappler.com
