Indonesia to send assistance to Nepal soon

Jakarta (ANTARA News) -- The Indonesian government will dispatch a donation of US$1 million and a rescue team to Nepal when the airport of the country, which was hit by a massive earthquake, is repaired and able to receive airplanes.



"We will donate US$1 million and send a rescue team there as soon as possible. We have experience in post-disaster work, such as after tsunamis and earthquakes," Vice President M. Jusuf Kalla said here on Monday.



In addition, Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs A. M. Fachir stated that the dispatch was hampered by a devastating landslide that damaged Nepals airport.



"The president has approved the sending of the donation and relief aid such as tents, blankets, and medicines. They are expected to be sent soon. However, the airport is damaged, not closed," Fachir noted.



"There is no access. The airport is not operational and the power supply is off," he pointed out.



Once the airport resumes operations, the government will send assistance to Nepal immediately.



"The airport is most likely being repaired now. We will hopefully be able to dispatch the assistance soon," he remarked.



As many as 3,218 people were killed and some 6,500 others injured in the powerful earthquake that struck Nepal at midday on Saturday, authorities were quoted as saying on Monday morning by Xinhua.



The 7.9-magnitude quake jolted the central, western, mid-western and far-western parts of Nepal, which was followed by at least 15 strong aftershocks, with the last one of 6.7 magnitude occurring on Sunday afternoon.



The quake has also caused property damages worth billions of US dollars in the country.



Moreover, some 34 Indonesians were in Nepal when the earthquake occurred, the Indonesian Foreign Affairs Ministry revealed.



Of the total, 17 people were contacted, while the whereabouts of the other 17 are still unknown, the ministry said.
