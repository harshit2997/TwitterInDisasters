Said Business School, University of Oxford: Student Will Match $20,000 for Nepal Earthquake Fundraising Campaign

OXFORD, UK, May 1, 2015 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- via PRWEB - April Chapman, a student from the Diploma in Strategy and Innovation programme at Saïd Business School, University of Oxford and Co-Chair of the World Vision Innovation Fund, has begun a fundraising campaign for the Nepal earthquake with her fellow students, in which April will personally match every dollar raised in the next 7 days, up to $20,000.

The 7.8 earthquake has affected over 8 million people and over 5,000 people have lost their lives. Many survivors are in urgent need of food and water and are sleeping out in the open.

So far the Oxford student's fund has raised around $4,000 (to be matched by an additional $4,000) and the proceeds will go to World Vision, a faith-based humanitarian development and relief organisation that serve the poor in over 100 countries. World Vision's staff in Nepal, along with staff mobilised from other countries, are delivering temporary shelters, food, hygiene kits, water, emergency health and protection for children.

April Chapman said: 'As soon as the news broke about the tragedy in Nepal, social media posts and emails within our group started flying to discuss what we could do to offer help. In fact, one of our colleagues, who is a cardiologist, was consulting with search and rescue teams on their way to Nepal. We quickly coalesced around a group financial gift for our Nepalese neighbours. I am personally delighted to be part of this generous Oxford Diploma cohort. Their willingness to make a difference during this difficult tragedy is inspiring and we invite others to join us.'

Christopher Mckenna, Academic Director of the Diploma in Strategy and Innovation programme at Oxford Saïd said: 'The participants on the Diploma in Strategy and Innovation always create a strong network in the course and beyond. This remarkable team spirit is particularly evident this year in their collective aid following the earthquake in Nepal.'
