The death toll has reached 4,800 with officials now saying more than 9,200 people have been injured.

JOHANNESBURG - The death toll from Saturday's earthquake in Nepal has reached 4,800 with officials now saying more than 9,200 people have been injured and one million children are in urgent need of help.

Heartbreaking scenes of suffering and loss are playing out across the nation as it reels from its deadliest natural disaster in more than 80 years.

Aid groups, including South Africa's Gift of the Givers Foundation and at least 16 nations have rushed to Nepal with more on the way.

Gift of the Givers Foundation's Imtiaz Sooliman says the team is currently on a connecting flight from Singapore to Kathmandu in Nepal and will hopefully get to work immediately.

"We have made contact with the Nepalese authorities and because we have Nepalese doctors with us, they have spoken to the disaster teams and they are hoping they can start working immediately today. Rescuers are working through the night and everybody is rushing against time." Watch: #NepalQuake: Medical situation dire

ASSISTANCE FROM JAPAN

It was on Tuesday announced that Japan provided more than US$8 million in emergency aid to Nepal and will dispatch additional rescue teams.

Japanese media reported that about 20 additional staff were set to leave the country to assist local rescue teams on the ground.

A separate team of about 70 rescue experts from Japan was dispatched over the weekend, but their flight reportedly could not land at the airport in Kathmandu on Tuesday due to local weather conditions.

According to the Japanese Foreign Ministry, the decision to send in the initial team in a hurry was made after an urgent request from the Nepalese government.

Hundreds of thousands of Nepalis live in countries outside the mountain state, including an estimated 42,000 in Japan.
