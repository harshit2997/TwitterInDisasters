The team includes medical staff from Kaohsiung Chang Gung Memorial Hospital, charity workers from Taiwan's Red Cross Society and Buddhist charity groups such as Fo Guang Shan Compassion Foundation, and volunteers from airlines.

The medical personnel include traumatologists, plastic surgeons and emergency physicians, according to a press release from Kaohsiung Chang Gung Memorial Hospital.

They brought medicine and equipment with them. More will follow once the team has a clear and more accurate list of its needs, the hospital said.

The death toll of the powerful earthquake, which hit in Nepal on Saturday, has climbed to 4,555.

According to the island's foreign affairs department, a total of 211 people from Taiwan are in Nepal. The whereabouts of 18 is still unknown.
