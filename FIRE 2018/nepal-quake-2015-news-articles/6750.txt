SAN DIEGO — The wreckage of a Marine Corps helicopter from Camp Pendleton missing in Nepal since Tuesday has been found, and there are no apparent survivors, the U.S. military said Friday.

Six Marines and two Nepalese soldiers were aboard the UH-1Y Huey when it disappeared while on a relief mission in response to a pair of earthquakes in the mountainous nation.

The wreckage was found by a Nepalese search team about 8 miles north of Charikot, the military said in a statement. The Nepalese reported finding three bodies.

The Pentagon said the families of the Marines killed had been notified. The victims' names were to be released within a day.

“They were courageous; they were selfless individuals dedicated to the international rescue mission here in Nepal,” Marine Corps Lt. Gen. John Wissler said.

Members of an Air Force search-and-rescue crew identified the crash site in a rugged forest at an elevation of 11,000 feet but couldn't stay on the scene because of high winds and inclement weather.

Efforts to recover the bodies would resume at daylight, Wissler said. Because of the terrain and the condition of the wreckage, it is unlikely that there were any survivors, he said.

In a statement, Defense Secretary Ashton Carter thanked the Nepalese and Indian governments for their continued support in the search and recovery operations.

“This tragedy is a reminder of the vital but dangerous role that American service members play in delivering humanitarian assistance and disaster relief,” he said. “Our mission continues in Nepal, and we remain dedicated to answering the call when disaster strikes, both in the Asia-Pacific and around the world.”

To verify that the broken, burned wreckage was that of the missing Huey, the United States sent in four Air Force pararescue specialists and a combat rescue officer.

No distress call was made before the Huey went missing while taking supplies to stranded villagers, but there may have been a transmission about a fuel problem, officials said.

The aircraft is from Light Attack Helicopter Squadron 469 based at Camp Pendleton, near San Diego.

The squadron was in the Philippines on a training mission when it was directed to Nepal to join the relief effort.
