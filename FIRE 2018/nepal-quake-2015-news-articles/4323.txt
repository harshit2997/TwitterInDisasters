SINGAPORE — All 220 Singaporeans who had registered with the Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MFA) are accounted for and are safe, the ministry said in a press statement today (April 30).

Before the earthquake on Monday, only 58 Singaporeans in Nepal had initially registered with the ministry through its eRegister, said an MFA spokesperson.

“The number escalated to over 220 Singaporeans after the earthquake. Through the assistance of our Crisis Response Team at the Kathmandu International Airport, more than 100 have returned to Singapore over the past few days on the RSAF and commercial flights,” the spokesperson said.

Meanwhile, another two Republic of Singapore Air Force (RSAF) C-130 planes were headed to the quake-stricken country yesterday with additional supplies and personnel, the Ministry of Defence said in a press statement.

On the board the two C-130 aircraft that left this morning were food and water supplies, medical supplies, as well as six additional Singapore Armed Forces (SAF) personnel from the Changi Regional Humanitarian Assistance and Disaster (RHAD) Relief Coordination Centre (RHCC). They were also joined by eight personnel from the Royal Brunei Armed Forces (RBAF).

Providing updates in a short Facebook post today, Defence Minister Ng Eng Hen said one of the aircrafts has already landed in Kathmandu.

“The C-130s are bringing additional medical supplies and more SAF personnel to augment the Changi Regional HADR Coordination Centre team there, to help the Nepalese Multinational Military Coordination Centre to better orchestrate recovery efforts,” said Mr Ng.

The RBAF personnel will join the SAF medical team deployed to Gokarna town, where they will work together to provide medical assistance to the earthquake victims there, Mindef added.

Local humanitarian organisation Mercy Relief and the Singapore Red Cross (SRC) have also sent their first medical teams in to Nepal.

Mercy Relief said today it has sent a medical team of two doctors and two nurses together with 350kg worth of supplies, surgical tools and equipment.
