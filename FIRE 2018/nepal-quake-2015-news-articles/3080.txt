BANGKOK, 27 April 2015 – The Embassy of Nepal in Bangkok is welcoming monetary donations from Thai people through two bank accounts while affirming the search for the injured and the missing is ongoing in the quake-ravaged country.

HE Mr Khaga Nath Adhikari, Nepalese Ambassador to Thailand, has given an interview in regard to the massive tremor that shook Nepal on April 25. The disaster has left over 2,000 people dead and 7,000 others wounded and the numbers are still rising.
