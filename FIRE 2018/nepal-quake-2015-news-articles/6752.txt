8 Bodies Found in Wreckage of Marine Helicopter, Nepal Army Says

KATHMANDU, Nepal — Eight bodies were found at the site of the crash of a United States Marine helicopter that disappeared in Nepal while assisting in earthquake relief efforts, the Nepalese Army said Saturday evening.

Six Marines and two Nepali soldiers were aboard the UH-1 Huey when it lost radio contact on Tuesday after a 7.3 magnitude earthquake, the worst aftershock since the April 25 quake that killed more than 8,000 people.

The bodies were not recovered, according to Nepal’s army in a revision of an earlier statement, because bad weather halted efforts to lift them from the scene.

The wreckage of the helicopter was discovered Friday on a high mountain pass near the village of Charikot, amid treacherous conditions that made recovery efforts dangerous.

A Marine spokeswoman, Capt. Cassandra Gesecki, said that eight sets of remains had been found but had not been identified or recovered.

The names of the Marines and the Nepali soldiers were not released.
