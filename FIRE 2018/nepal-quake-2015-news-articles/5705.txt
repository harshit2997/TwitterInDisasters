The parents of a five-month-old 'miracle' baby that was found alive after 22 hours buried in rubble in quake-stricken Nepal, have described the moment they heard a faint cry beneath the debris.

Incredible photos have emerged of the moment an infant, now known as the miracle baby, was pulled from the wreckage of a building in Nepal.

After being buried under the rubble for more than 22 hours, amazingly, baby Sonit Awal was found alive and healthy.

CNN reported that the baby’s mother, Rasmila Awal, was out shopping and had just returned home when the earthquake struck. She watched on as the building collapsed, knowing her children were inside.

"I had very little hope that they had survived," told CNN.

But after two hours her 10-year-old daughter Soniya was found alive.

“We started digging out our little girl, and when she came out we kept searching for the boy.”

The Nepalese army arrived to help with the search and rescue effort but by late that evening the baby was still missing. The family went to sleep in a nearby field, but never gave up hope. They returned to the wreckage the next morning where they heard a faint cry beneath the debris.

“We heard a voice, that’s when we were assured that the little boy was alive. After hearing the voice, we started digging again,” she told CNN.

The Nepalese army were back to help with search and eventually one solider pulled the infant from the rubble.

Rasmila Awal said her neighbour told her it was destiny.

“[She said] If he is destined to live, he will or else god will take him away.”
