Nepal is a popular destination for backpackers. According to last year's figures, China was the second largest source of tourists to Nepal. But after Saturday's earthquake, a number of Chinese tourists are stranded in Nepal. And all of them are looking to head back home as quickly as possible.

A day after Nepal's worst earthquake in 80 years, the slightest tremor is enough to panic stranded tourists.



China's National Tourism Administration says 683 Chinese tourists were known to be in Nepal at the time of the quake. They include 52 tourist groups and some individual tourists.



Many have been speaking about the moment the quake struck.



"I was in a small alleyway when the earthquake struck. It knocked me over. I felt strong shaking, stones were falling from above. I couldn't see anything as the air was full of heavy dust. The shaking went on for about 20 or 30 seconds, I can't remember exactly. When I ran into the street, I saw telegraph poles had fallen down, walls collapsed, buildings with cracks through them. People were standing in the street. There were two strong aftershocks. Many people started crying. There were no phone signals and we couldn't send out messages," a Chinese tourist in Nepal said.





Offers of help are now pouring in from governments. The Chinese Foreign Ministry on Sunday held an emergency meeting to coordinate and speed up rescue and relief work in quake affected areas. This involves using highways linking Nepal and the Tibet Autonomous Region to deliver aid, and arranging medical teams for rescue and epidemic prevention.



Right after the Kathmandu airport in Nepal re-opened this morning, two flights departed for China, the first one carrying 230 passengers arrived in the southwestern city of Kunming. Most of the passengers arrived back home in stable condition.



"Above our evacuation plan, our priority is to secure the water and food supply as well as accommodation for those still stranded in Nepal. Secondly, we will inform the tourists as soon as we get updated news," a travel agency manager said.



Upon the request of Chinese government, 18 flights are planned to operate between China and Nepal Sunday. They are expected to bring back 1,000 tourists, both Chinese nationals and foreigners.
