Weird weather and strange phenomena around the world

A 101-year-old man has been pulled alive from the rubble of his house in Nepal seven days after it collapsed in the earthquake that has killed thousands.Funchu Tamang was rescued on Saturday suffering only minor injuries, and was airlifted to hospital.According to the Daily Telegraph , Arun Kumar Singh, a local police officer, told AFP: "He was brought to the district hospital in a helicopter. His condition is stable."He has injuries on his left ankle and hand. His family is with him."He is being treated at a hospital in Nuwakot district, around 80 kilometres (50 miles) northwest of Kathmandu.Nepal's earthquake has claimed at least 7,200 lives, and the government warned on 3 May that the death toll will climb 'much higher'.The UK Government's humanitarian response package for the Nepal earthquake now stands at £22.8 million, following a £5.3 million contribution to the United Nations' emergency appeal, reports the Press Association.The new money will be split between agencies helping supply food, clean water and shelter to the millions of people affected by Nepal's worst earthquake in 80 years - the World Food Programme, Unicef, the Office for the Co-ordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA), the International Organisation for Migration (IOM) and the International Federation of the Red Cross (IFRC).The announcement came as the Himalayan country was forced to close its only international airport to large jets because they are causing damage to its runway as they bring in aid, following last Saturday's 7.8 magnitude quake.The UN has appealed for £274 million for its "flash appeal" to help those affected by the quake, which killed more than 7,000 people and injured thousands more.It was revealed on Saturday that eight Britons stranded in a monastery had been rescued, a week after the devastating earthquake struck.A team of humanitarian experts chartered a helicopter to get to the group, who were marooned at a remote mountainside religious retreat in Bihi, near Lho.The team of emergency staff from the Department for International Development (Dfid) flew the group to Kathmandu where on Friday they boarded planes to start their journey back to the UK.It came as an RAF C-17 which had taken aid to Nepal rescued another seven Britons from the country - bringing the number of people from the UK who were safely evacuated yesterday to 15.A former Gurkha yesterday told the BBC that four people from the UK's Nepali community were killed in the disaster.Kashi Rai from Swindon in Wiltshire said at least three of the four victims were Nepali citizens from the town who had indefinite leave to live in the UK.His brother and his sister-in-law were among those who had died, he said.Reports of another British victim killed at Mount Everest base camp are still being investigated.
