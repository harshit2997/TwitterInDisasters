A total of 8,450 tents were dispatched to Nepal on Thursday for people affected by the devastating earthquake, the National Disaster Response Force (NDRF) said here.

An NDRF statement said 750 tents received from paramilitary forces -- including 250 each from the NDRF and the Central Industrial Security Force (CISF), 150 from the National Security Guard (NSG) and 100 from the Border Security Force (BSF) -- were being airlifted to Nepal with NDRF's coordination.

In addition, 7,700 tents contributed by the Central Reserve Police Force (1,600), BSF (2,000), Indo-Tibetan Border Police (200), CISF (250), NDRF (3,000), Sashastra Seema Bal (200), Assam Rifles (300) and NSG (150) were being sent via rail to assist the Nepalese authorities.

The NDRF has deployed 13 Urban Search and Rescue (USAR) teams. Along with other foreign agencies, these are engaged in rescue work in Nepal, where a massive 7.9-magnitude earthquake left over 5,000 people dead.

According to the force, it was among the first foreign organisations that began rescue operations in Nepal and has so far saved 11 injured people and has retrieved 115 bodies.

The NDRF has recovered currency notes of Nepali Rs.2 lakh, five mobile phones along with some other electronic equipment and gold jewellery.
