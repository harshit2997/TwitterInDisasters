A survivor recalls those dreadful two days

Bengaluru, April 28, 2015, DHNS: 0:59 IST

The pandal under which he sat just minutes ago had now come crashing down. Destiny was by his side as Himmath Jain had stepped out of the place just minutes before the ground beneath started shaking violently.



Sharing his harrowing experience he had when earthquake of 7.9 magnitude rocked the Himalayan nation, to Deccan Herald, the City based e-commerce professional said that he saw the pandal in which he was present, just minutes ago, come crashing down on people.

Jain, who was among the lucky few to survive the tragedy, is back home.



Jain landed in Kathmandu on April 24 as he had a religious conference to attend on April 25. It was by 11.30 am that the spiritual talks by a religious leader of Jain community and Baba Ramdev had just concluded, recalled Jain. “I was standing outside the area when the tremors began. There were over 1,000 people seated under the pandal erected for the conference. In a few minutes, people were caught under the same. I, along with many others, ran to their rescue,” he said adding “Luckily, no causalities were reported.”



“The next location was police headquarters. There was a huge training place where we all rushed to. For the next two days, people waited in the same place. Soon, we realised that we were all running short of all the essentials. There was scarcity of food and water. By the end of day two, we almost ran out of supplies,” he recalled. Jain had a flight scheduled at 8.30 pm on April 26. However, this survivor could only breathe a sigh of relief seven hours later. “I already had a pre-booked flight. However, it was only at 3 am that it took off,” Jain said.



He also explained that the situation was no better at the airport where over 5,000 people waiting for help and there is acute shortage of food and water at the airport, Jain added.
