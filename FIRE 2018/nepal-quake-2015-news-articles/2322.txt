KASARGOD: ‘Say something’ reads the status message of Aziz Ali. He has not heard anything from his younger brother, Mohammed Azhar Ali, 23, and five of his friends since a powerful earthquake devastated Nepal on Saturday.

“The last the boys shared with their friends’ group was a selfie from a suspension bridge in Sindhupalchok district of Nepal,” Aziz Ali, a resident of Deli in Kasargod, says. He identified the other missing friends as Thanweer Rawther, 25, from Kochi; Hadil Haneef, 25, from Thalassery; Mazhar Mohideen, 25, from Kannur; Nihad Moinuddin Khan, 25, from Hyderabad; and Sunil Chandrasen Gandhi, 26, from Mumbai. The six chartered accountants, who worked in Dubai, flew down to Nepal from the emirate on Friday for a week-long adventure camp. Their last know location is Naya Pul, a resort near Tatopani at Sindhupalchok. But officials said the district, which is 90km from Katmandu, was not affected by the quake and hoped the group is safe. “All the utilities are down and that’s why they are not able to get in touch,” an official in Delhi told Aziz Ali. The families and friends of the six youths are clinging to the selfie and have formed a group to coordinate with officials in Kathmandu and Delhi.

“We have registered their names with the Ministry of External Affairs. But neither the control room in Delhi nor the one in Katmandu have heard anything from them yet,” he says. But most of the time the families are not able to get through the helpline numbers, Aziz Ali says, and that is increasing their edginess.
