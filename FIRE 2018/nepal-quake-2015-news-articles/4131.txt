It is time to pitch in and help
</headline>

Britain is sending millions of pounds in foreign aid to help in the aftermath of the Nepalese earthquake.

The UN says the disaster has affected 8.1 million people – more than a quarter of Nepal's population of 27.8 million – and that 1.4 million need food assistance.

So it is only right that as one of the world’s brightest and richest nations we do all we can to help those in need.

But the revelations of Britons trapped on Nepalese mountains, allegedly because the UK has not yet got round to sending its own rescue helicopters, is nothing short of outrageous.

What’s also outrageous are claims that other countries are helping evacuate their own people but leaving behind those who don’t share their nationality. Nobody can really understand the gravity of the situation in Nepal. And it’s easy for the media and general public to scrutinise the situation from the comfort of our homes and offices.

But it’s going to take a monumental effort from countries across the world to start rebuilding the country and helping Nepal off the canvas. That starts with helping and supporting one another, regardless of what country your passport was produced in. This is a human tragedy spanning across nationalities.

It is also worth mentioning that there are more than just British people affected by the disaster. As a local newspaper, The Argus can be forgiven for reporting mainly on people affected in our news patch.

But we all need to remember that this disaster has taken thousands of lives and it is time to pitch in and limit the rest of the suffering.
