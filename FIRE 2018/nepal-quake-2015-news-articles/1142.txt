Flight operations to Kathmandu’s Tribhuvan International Airport have resumed after Saturday’s devastating 7.9 magnitude earthquake that flattened buildings and monuments in Nepal, with the official death toll crossing 2,000.



Flight operations from the UAE were also affected, with flydubai confirming four flights were cancelled on Saturday.



Operations on Sunday have resumed with the carrier, with the airline confirming in a statement, saying: "flydubai flight FZ 577 from Dubai to Kathmandu departed Dubai this morning at 7.27am. The estimated arrival time in Kathmandu is 13:30 (Kathmandu local time).



"We are expecting to operate four flights to and from Kathmandu today. However due to congestion at Kathmandu airport there may be delays."



The airline further stated the situation in Kathmandu prompted flydubai to cancel flights FZ8571/2 and FZ573/4 on Saturday.



Flydubai further added:"Passengers have been giving the option of full refund or rebook at different dates. Passengers wishing to rebook are advised to contact their travel agent or the flydubai contact centre."

Meanwhile, Jet Airways has also confirmed that it will waive off all cancellation charges and issue refunds or reissue dates on confirmed tickets issued for travel to and from Kathmandu between 25 April and May 1, 2015



The Indian carrier, which is an alliance partner with the Abu Dhabi-based Eithad Airways, further stated: "All our flights to Kathmandu are operating as per schedule. We will add additional flights to Kathmandu as required."



The Sharjah-based Air Arabia has also resumed operations to the Nepal capital, with flights G9539 and G9531D both landing in Kathmandu earlier today.



Air Arabia also flies to Kathmandu from Ras Al Khaimah International Airport on Sundays and Wednesdays.



Indian carriers such as SpiceJet, Air India and IndiGo have also confirmed they are waiving cancellation charges to the Nepal capital this week.



President Aditya Ghosh stated on his official Twitter account: "We have waived the cancellation charges on IndiGo flights to Kathmandu for a week."



In wake of the Nepal earthquake, the three carriers are also shuttling relief material free of cost to Kathmandu.
