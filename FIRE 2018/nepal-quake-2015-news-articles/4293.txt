More than one thousand residents of Jorpati outside Kathmandu in Nepal have found shelter in their local SOS Children’s Village after last week’s earthquake.

The needs of the displaced earthquake survivors are monitored on a daily basis. They are currently housed in 42 tents, the physiotherapy hall, the director’s quarters and classrooms of the in-house school.Even the children from the Wonderful Unity Child Club of SOS Children’s Village Jorpati played a part in the relief effort when they conducted a clean-up campaign on the premises.

Please help the children!

SOS Children's Villages is helping Nepali families and children recover from the earthquakes and rebuild their lives, with shelter and care for unaccompanied children; food, clothing and household essentials; and support for adults in re-establishing livelihoods and family homes. Please join us in helping them.
