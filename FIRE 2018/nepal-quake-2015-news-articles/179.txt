New Delhi, Apr 25 (IBNS) Death toll in Nepal shot up to 700 as a massive earthquake measuring 7.9 magnitude struck on Saturday causing devastating damage that spread also to India.

The Nepal government declared a state of emergency to handle the situation.



The quake, said to be strongest in Nepal in 80 years also rocked many parts of India killing at least 17 people.



The epicentre of the earthquake lay 80 km (50 miles) east of Pokhara in Nepal, United States Geological Survey (USGS) said.



The quake pulled down buildings, temples and towers, felled trees and electric posts and left yawning cracks on roads across Nepal, specially in Kathmandu, the capital.



The historic Dharara Tower built in the 19th century in Kathmandu collapsed, trapping at least 50 people, Nepal media reported.



Efforts are on to recover more bodies from under heaps of rubble.



In India, the tremor was badly felt in places like Delhi, Rajasthan, Haryana, Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, Jharkhand, West Bengal, Odisha and the northeastern states.



Reports of over 30 death came from Bihar, Uttar Pradesh and West Bengal. While three deaths were reported from West Bengal, in Bihar 22 died, said reports.



Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi spoke to his Nepal counterpart Sushil Koirala over the massive earthquake that hit the Himalayan nation on Saturday.



"Spoke to PM Sushil Koirala, who is in transit in Bangkok on his way to Kathmandu. Assured all support & assistance during this tough time," Modi tweeted.



He also called chief ministers of several states to know about the situation following a major earthquake that jolted the country on Saturday.



Modi convened a high level meeting with Ministers and top officials to work out agenda to reach out to the people in the affected areas.

India's Ministry of External Affairs said an IAF C-130 Superhercules with NDRF relief teams onboard is airborne for Kathmandu. More relief efforts are underway in Nepal by India, it said.

Nepal has sought medical relief from India.
