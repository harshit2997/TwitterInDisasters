Calgary bar owner among passengers flown out of Nepal Wednesday on Canadian Air Force transport plane.

A Calgary bar owner is among a number of Canadians who have been flown out of earthquake-ravaged Nepal on a Canadian Air Force transport plane Wednesday.

Cam Dobranski, owner of Winebar Kensington and his wife Jacq were hiking on their honeymoon after getting married in Nepal 2 days before the quake struck.

According to Metro, the couple were in the Nepalese mountains when the earthquake hit and while they escaped injury, they had to hike back thru lots of debris from the quake and subsequent avalanches.

From there, they arrived at the American Embassy in Nepal before catching the flight.

Dobranskiâ€™s unmistakeable long beard can be seen in the above image released by the RCAF.

Dobranksi and his wife are in the middle row at the bottom right.
