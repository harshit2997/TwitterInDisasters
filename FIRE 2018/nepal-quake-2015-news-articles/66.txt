Agra: Tremors of an earthquake that jolted Nepal was felt in the city on Saturday afternoon. Although there have been no loss of human lives, a dilapidated water tank in Etamad-ud-Daula area collapsed and a few buildings in the older part of the city reportedly developed cracks.Almost half-a-dozen aftershocks which were felt in the city between 11.45am and 3.30pm also resulted in a cement canopy come crashing down on a vehicle parked in the S N Medical College premises.Taj Mahal bore the brunt of the quake as well, but no damage was reported as a result. Other heritage sites in and around the city remained unscathed as well, according to the local administration.Although there were rumours being circulated on WhatsApp about deaths of people in the city, district magistrate Pankaj Kumar downplayed such speculation, saying: "I assure our people that no human loss has been reported in Agra. We request citizens to remain calm and ignore misinformation being peddled by unverified sources."Terrified by the endless aftershocks that hit the city, locals huddled in groups. Panicked residents rushed out out, pouring out from residential high-rises, hotels and hospitals.Standing outside S N Medical College with his septuagenarian paralytic father, Santosh Raguram said, "The entire building of the hospital began shaking around 11.45am. Medical equipments and the bed in which my father was lying began swaying. We felt dizzy for nearly 15 minutes after the incident."Shelja Mishra, working for a private bank in Sanjay Place, also narrated a similar story. "We rushed out of our office building and huddled in the parking lot. We saw buildings moving like a pendulum. Fortunately, no one was injured but many of them felt nauseous after the tremors," she said.Traffic also came to a standstill as people emerged from their houses to escape the quake.
