: The 1Malaysia Putera Club (KP1M) will send a medical team comprising 25 doctors to Kathmandu, the worst affected area following the earthquake that struck Nepal last Saturday.Its president Datuk Seri Abdul Azeez Abdul Rahim said the team, in collaboration with the UMNO Social Welfare Bureau, which he also heads, will bring medical supplies, food, clothing and blankets to be distributed to the victims there and are expected to depart tomorrow or the day after."The latest report I received was that there was not enough food there and God willing we will speed up our efforts to deliver aid."KP1M is now actively preparing by purchasing medicine, and our volunteers are looking for goods such as blankets and food to be taken there," he said at a a gathering here last night.He said that so far only the Kathmandu area could be accessed by air, and that the surrounding areas were still inaccessible for sending aid.An earthquake measuring 7.9 on the Richter scale struck Nepal in areas between its capital Kathmandu and Pokhara town at 2.56pm (Malaysian time) on Saturday. So far 5,020 people have been reported dead and another 7,624, injured.
