Son’s emotional tribute to Nepal earthquake victim Renu Fotedar

<text>
THE son of a Melbourne woman killed in the Nepal has remembered her as a “healer and a helper” who dedicated her life to “inspiring people”.

In a tribute posted on social media, Tushar Fotedar described mother of two Renu Fotedar as a selfless person who would have put those around her first had she survived.

The 49-year-old was at a Mt Everest base camp with a trekking company when the quake struck.

“Renu Fotedar was born in the mountains of Kashmir, and she passed at the highest of peaks in the Himalayas, in her sleep, right in the lap of God,” he wrote.

“She is one with the source and we as a family are at peace with that.

“I have come to terms with my mother’s passing. I am not sad for she was an extraordinary woman.

“A healer and a helper, she dedicated her life to inspiring people, freeing them of their own mental prisons and setting them on a course to live their life to it’s fullest potential.

“I am proud to be born from the womb of such a woman.”

Ms Fotedar was cremated after authorities last week confirmed she had been killed in the natural disaster and her body was returned to Kathmandu.

She was a holistic counsellor and had recently moved with family to Switzerland, where she ran a business.

“Reading through social media, personal messages and meeting close family members and friends alike, it’s humbling to see how many lives she has touched throughout the course of her life,” Mr Fotedar said.

“My mother taught compassion and her time spent on this earth was expended on bettering the human race as a whole.

“She believed that all human beings were the same, living together on this one earth and that it was our duty and responsibility to look after one another and so.

“In this time of sorrow, it is absolutely essential that we give attention to our fellow brothers and sisters in Nepal. They need us.

“Please do what you can to support them. They are fragile, broken and need to be healed.”
