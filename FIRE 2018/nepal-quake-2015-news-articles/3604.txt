First Evangelical Lutheran Church collecting donations for Nepal

REDLANDS>> The First Evangelical Lutheran Church in Redlands is accepting donations to assist with disaster relief efforts in Nepal.

A 7.8 magnitude earthquake hit Nepal on Saturday, killing more than 4,000 people and injuring more than 7,000 as of earlier this week.

Volunteers with Lutheran Disaster Response are on the ground in Nepal now offering assistance to those affected by the earthquake.

Pastor Kim EiFert Krogstad said Saturday morning she had already received a message from the national, Evangelical Lutheran Church in America, about the relief efforts planned for Nepal.

“They actually had a couple people on the ground there and they were beginning to coordinate with them,” she said.

The Redlands church, at 1207 W. Cypress Ave., is collecting money to purchase water, tents and blankets.

All of the proceeds donated to the churches nationwide go directly to relief efforts. Administrative costs are paid for through the regular budget, she said.

Volunteers with Lutheran Disaster Response provide long-term recovery efforts for months or even years following a disaster, she said.

“We tend to stay on the ground a lot longer because we know there are still systemic and emotional needs for people once the immediate crisis is over,” she said.

The Salvation Army was also already on the ground when the earthquake hit. They are accepting monetary donations online at inlandempire.salvationarmy.org or salvationarmyusa.org

Monetary donations can also be dropped off at the Salvation Army in Redlands at 801 W. Colton Ave.

The American Red Cross is also accepting monetary donations at their offices and on their website at redcross.org.
