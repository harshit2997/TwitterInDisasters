AmeriCares offering relief to Nepal earthquake victims - WFSB 3 Connecticut
</headline>

<text>
As the death toll continues to climb in Nepal following a devastating earthquake, Connecticut-based AmeriCares is already on the ground providing medical relief.

AmeriCares' President and CEO Micahel Nynhuis said a team from the Stamford headquarters is heading out to Nepal, along with medical personnel from New York City, in addition to the supplies they are shipping over.

While trusted relief organizations like AmeriCares need donations in order to do their work, there are some looking to take advantage of the tragedy and the support from the public.

Inside of the AmeriCares' warehouse, there were stacked pallets of medical supplies all bound for Nepal, and it has been that way since the 7.8 magnitude earthquake that rocked the region on Saturday.

"The medical needs are overwhelming,” Nynhuis said. "We're sending medical supplies, everything from antibiotics to other medicine, to bandages and gauss."

He said as soon as the quake hit, they had an emergency response team ready to go.

"The hospitals, some of them have been damaged, some of the clinics have been damaged, and people are being treated outside of hospitals, outside of sterile environments,” Nynhuis said.

Because AmeriCares works directly with pharmaceutical companies and medical suppliers, it said for every dollar donated, it can get $20 worth of supplies into the hands of doctors in Nepal.

However, in wanting to help, Fairfield Police Chief Gary MacNamara said the public needs to know who they are giving to.

"We instantly know that there will be an outpouring of support for Nepal from the surrounding areas and that's a god thing. There's a bad element to it."

Scammers are sending out fake emails and setting up fake accounts to try to get well intended money.

"This warning should not be taken lightly. It has a history, we've seen in other tragedies around the world, Haiti, other places overseas as well as the tragedy in Newtown, CT where people take advantage of people's good will to help,” MacNamara said.
