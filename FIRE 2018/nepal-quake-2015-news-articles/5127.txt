EU boosts Nepal aid to nearly 23 million euros

The European Commission agreed on Monday to boost its aid to Nepal by 16.6 million euros.

That’s nearly quadruple the original commitment of 6 million euros made following last week’s earthquake. Jointly, Brussels and EU member states have pledged 40 million in aid.

EU Commissioner Christos Stylianidis, who’s responsible for Humanitarian Aid and Crisis Response, has just returned from a four day mission in Kathmandu to witness the destruction for himself.

Commissioner Stylianidis said the additional funds would be released this week.

“We have to beat the monsoon season. That’s due in around 3 or 4 weeks and if we’re in the same situation then, the change in the weather will create massive problems,” he added.

The funds have been earmarked for the most urgent needs including clean water, medicine, telecommunications and shelter.
