New Delhi: Foreign Secretary S Jaishankar and National Security Adviser Ajit Doval on Friday visited Kathmandu to oversee relief operations in Nepal in the wake of last Saturday's devastating quake.

After reviewing the situation in Nepal, Doval said there has been a lot of damage.

"But Nepalese and Indian Army are working in tandem. Rescue and relief operations are in full swing," added Doval.

India has the largest rescue team in Nepal followed closely by China in the wake of the April 25 quake which killed thousands.

India and China are Nepal's largest neighbours.

India has so far supplied 280 tonnes of relief material including drinking water, milk, biscuits, noodles, essential medicines, tents, blankets, tarpaulin and plastic sheets.

It has also flown into Kathmandu two field hospitals, 18 Army medical teams, 18 engineering teams, an Indian Air Force rapid action medical team as well as excavators and earth moving equipment.

Sixteen National Disaster Response Force (NDRF) teams working with Nepalese security agencies have saved 11 lives and retrieved 121 bodies in Kathmandu.

Three Indian Army medical teams have been deployed in Barpak village, the epicentre of the earthquake in Gorkha district.

A 39-member Indian Army team currently at the Everest Base Camp has remained there to assist people including stranded tourists and climbers.

Indian helicopters have delivered 100 tonnes of relief material in various districts of Nepal including Gorkha, Dhading, Nuwakot, Ramechhap, Sindhupalchowk and Rasuwa.

A team from the Power Grid Corp of India is working with the Nepalese government to restore power supply in different parts of Nepal.

The Indian team has helped restore three sub-power stations in the Kathmandu Valley.
