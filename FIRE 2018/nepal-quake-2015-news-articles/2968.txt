LALITPUR, NEPAL - APRIL 28: Volunteers and quake rescue team members clear the debris from a collapsed temple near Patan Durbar Square on April 28, 2015 in Lalitpur, Nepal. A major 7.8 earthquake hit Kathmandu mid-day on Saturday, and was followed by multiple aftershocks that triggered avalanches on Mt. Everest that buried mountain climbers in their base camps. Many houses, buildings and temples in the capital were destroyed during the earthquake, leaving thousands dead or trapped under the debris as emergency rescue workers attempt to clear debris and find survivors. Regular aftershocks have hampered recovery missions as locals, officials and aid workers attempt to recover bodies from the rubble. (Photo: Omar Havana/Getty Images)

Structural engineer Dr. Kit Miyamoto, of Miyamoto International in West Sacramento, has arrived in Nepal.

After flying 30 hours to get from California to the earthquake-damaged city of Kathmandu, Miyamoto described the location as "dark and quiet". He's sharing a room in a small hotel with another structural engineer.

Nepal is 12 hours and 45 minutes ahead of California, so Miyamoto's plan at daybreak is to meet with local and government officials and then inspect a school that was damaged. Old, poorly built buildings crumbled like cookies during Saturday's 7.8 magnitude quake.

A nation that had little to begin with now has much less.

Miyamoto will be analyzing the integrity of the buildings still standing, and determining how to rebuild them to better withstand the next earthquake.

"Disasters are very similar, technically speaking. It just changes society completely, so nobody has faced anything like that and no one knows what to do. What we bring in is we go through this almost like every year, we know what needs to be done technically speaking," Miyamoto said of his role.

Nepal is just the latest earthquake assessment for Miyamoto. He spent months in Haiti and New Zealand. His Miyamoto International has expanded to six California cities and eight globally.

when there's a world disaster, Miyamoto gets called.

"I do quite a lot of travelling. It's a passion," he said.

Miyamoto will be in Nepal indefinitely. Part of his work is training local governments on how to rebuild safer structures.

"Earthquakes don't kill people. Quite frankly, buildings kill people, right? So, it's not very difficult to do it right. It doesn't cost much more to do that. Even in California, we can do so much better. We're still facing a major California earthquake in San Francisco or Los Angeles and we have to do better here."

Like previous trips he's made to disasters in Japan, Haiti and New Zealand, Miyamoto isn't sure how long he'll be in Nepal or how many times he'll return.

As he said, "I enjoy the travel. I have to".
