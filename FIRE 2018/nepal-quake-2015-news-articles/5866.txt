COLLEGE STATION, Texas--Hundreds of students at Texas A&M held a candlelight vigil Thursday evening for victims of the earthquake in Nepal.

Mourners at the vigil say even though the earthquake was thousands of miles away, it was felt right here at home.

The event was organized by the Nepalese Student Organization.

"Being from Nepal we want to, like, give some tribute to like those who lost their lives because Nepalese are so humble," said Smit Dhakal with the Nepalese Student Organization.

"We hope to spread some awareness about what's happening in Nepal and these victims and just give them some support even though we're so far away. Just pray for them and spiritual support and just know that we're here for them in any way that we can be," said student Chandler Smith.

The Nepalese Student Organization is also raising money for those affected by the tragedy.

A former A&M student was on Mount Everest when the earthquake struck but she survived.
