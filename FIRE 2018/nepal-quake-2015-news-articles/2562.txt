An earthquake with magnitude 7.8 shook Nepal on April 25. The death toll in the disaster has exceeded 4,000, with thousands more injured.

Ms Ngiam Le Na added that she understands that the roads to Lapchi Mountain, which is considered a holy site to Buddhists, are now inaccessible, and that the only way to reach there would be via a helicopter.

Quoting a colleague of the missing Ms Ngiam, Chinese newspaper Lianhe Zaobao reported that a monk from the area said that no one on the mountain is known to be in danger.

The colleague, Mr Luo Sang, 45, said that the Lapchi Mountain, which is on the border of Tibet, is remote, and that communication is limited.
