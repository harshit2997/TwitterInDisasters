SEPANG: The lack of transportation and poor accessibility are among the challenges faced by the Mercy Malaysia team to help Nepalese communities affected by the earthquake that struck Nepal recently.

Mercy Malaysia vice-president Dr Heng Aik Cheng said although there were many humanitarian aid, like food and medicines, arriving at Kathmandu Airport, they could not leave the tarmac due to these conditions.

He said following the earthquake, most of the roads were badly damaged and posed difficulty for vehicles to reach the affected areas.

"We moved very slowly and for the three-hour journey, we only covered 15km and could not reach the interior areas since many roads were damaged," he told the media after arriving from Kathmandu for Mercy assessment mission, here today.

He said the Mercy Emergency Response Unit team, which arrived in Kathmandu on April 28, was assigned to Ipatole, Shankhu and set up a mobile hospital there to serve an average of 250 patients a day.

The ERU team, comprised 28 medical personnel and logisticians, and had a field hospital set-up to serve those affected.

"We expect to serve for another three weeks to a month, but it still depends on the situation," he said.

Heng, who is a consultant orthopaedic surgeon and traumatologist, said the assistance now entered the second phase of recovery to provide shelter, food and water.

"Soon Nepal will be facing the monsoon season that normally runs from June to September and this will pose another problem to the affected people," he added. â€“ Bernama
