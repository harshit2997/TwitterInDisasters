Donate to Nepal by dining out

Eric Ripert’s triple Michelin-starred restaurant Le Bernardin in New York. — AFP picPARIS, May 14 — From restaurant titan Jean-Georges Vongerichten to local ‘ma and pa’ restaurateurs, the international food community is mobilising to help the victims of the devastating earthquakes in Nepal by allowing diners to eat a good meal and donate to rescue and recovery efforts at the same time.

Here’s a look at participating restaurants around the world:

Jean-Georges Vongerichten

Guests dining at any of Vongerichten’s 30 restaurants around the world including New York, Las Vegas, Miami, Paris, Tokyo, and Shanghai can contribute to rescue efforts by ordering a bottle of water, as US$5 for every bottle sold will be donated to partner MercyCorps, a humanitarian relief group that responds in disaster situations.

Le Bernardin, Eric Ripert

At Eric Ripert’s triple Michelin-starred restaurant Le Bernardin in New York and his Aldo Sohm Wine Bar, profits from the sales of the newly arrived Tibetan Yak Cheese will go towards relief efforts with Save the Children and The Tibet Fund. The US$12 (RM43) two-ounce cheese is served with condiments.

Brickhouse, Hong Kong

Donors have been flocking to this popular Mexican restaurant, managed by a Nepalese expat, to help raise funds for the Red Cross in exchange for homemade momo or Nepalese dumplings. Brickhouse makes recurring appearances on Hong Kong Tatler’s annual best restaurants list.

In solidarity, local Nepalese and Tibetan restaurants around the world have also been busy hosting charitable events for their homelands.

In Canada, a trio of Nepalese restaurants in Vancouver have banded together to hold a month-long fundraiser.

Every Monday night during the month of May, for instance, the Gurkha Himalayan Kitchen will donate 100 per cent of revenues for Nepal.

Every other day, the restaurant along with Yak & Yeti Bistro will also donate five per cent of sales earned throughout the month.

Café Kathmandu also held two dinner events over the last few weeks serving vegetarian and vegan meals.

All proceeds are being donated to the Canadian Red Cross and Educate the Children International.

Meanwhile, the following organisations are also collecting donations directly:

World Vision

Unicef

Save the Children
