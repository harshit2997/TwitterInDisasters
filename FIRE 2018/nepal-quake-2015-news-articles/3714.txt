NEW DELHI -- Offers of aid have been pouring in from around the world in the wake of Nepal's strongest earthquake in 80 years, which has left more than 5,000 confirmed dead.

The Asian Development Bank based in Manila has announced a grant of $3 million for immediate relief work, which will be followed by up to $200 million for initial rehabilitation projects.

The ADB provided $350 million in financial assistance to Nepal in 2014, and has around $2 billion in projects under way in the Himalayan country.

The U.S. said it will provide $10 million to help in recovery efforts. "We are working with the government of Nepal to provide assistance and support," Secretary of State John Kerry said in New York.

"The United States will provide an additional $9 million for earthquake response and recovery efforts. This is in addition to the $1 million already provided."

Japanese Foreign Minister Fumio Kishida, who was in New York for a Japan-U.S. security meeting, said his government will provide an emergency grant of up to 1 billion yen ($8.4 million) beyond the 25 million yen in relief already announced. Japanese rescue teams and medical personnel are being dispatched to Nepal.

"I hope that in responding to the situation, Japan and [the] U.S. will be able to work in close partnership, including exchange of information on the ground," said Kishida.

The U.K government has announced a package of 5 million pounds ($7.6 million), with 60% in immediate relief and the balance going through the British Red Cross. The U.K. is sending 1,100 shelter kits and over 1,700 solar lanterns along with a team of Gurkha engineers.

India was among the first responders with food, water, medicine and disaster response teams. China has promised humanitarian aid worth $3.3 million.

Reported deaths have mounted beyond Nepal. In India, the toll jumped to 72, with bordering Bihar suffering 57 deaths. In Tibet, 25 people have lost their lives.

Other countries offering aid include Canada, New Zealand, Pakistan, Russia and Sri Lanka.

The UN's humanitarian chief Valerie Amos has approved $15 million for immediate release from emergency funds. The UN said on Monday that most deaths have been recorded in Bhaktapur, Kathmandu and Lalitpur. A total of 8 million people living in 39 districts are affected, of which 1.4 million need food assistance.

Durbar Square and Dharahara Tower in Kathmandu are both Unesco World Heritage sites that have been devastated in the disaster. Tourism contributes around 8% to Nepal's gross domestic product, and brings in 800,000 international arrivals each year.

"The total long-term cost of reconstruction in Nepal using appropriate building standards for regions vulnerable to severe earthquakes could exceed $5 billion, which is around 20% of Nepal's GDP," said Rajiv Biswas, Asia-Pacific chief economist for consultancy IHS.
