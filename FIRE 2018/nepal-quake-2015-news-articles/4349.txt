Nepal earthquake: Gisborne couple buys Nepalese man a plane ticket home
</headline>

<text>
A Nepalese man living in Gisborne has been moved to tears by the generosity of a man who paid for him to fly to be with his homeless sisters.

Kathmandu-born Sandeep Singh has been deeply affected by the massive 7.8 magnitude earthquake that wrecked his family's house in devastated Nepal.

His two sisters, one with epilepsy, are among thousands of homeless. His parents died two years ago and he is the only son in the family.

"Our house was heavily damaged."

Since the quake, his sisters and two nieces have been living in the streets -- struggling for shelter and food.

Yesterday he received a phone call that left him lost for words.

Raymond Ruru, truck driver and co-owner of R and J Logging, told Mr Singh he needed his bank account number to deposit the $2570 needed to get home.

"It was amazing. He only knows me from coming into the shop. I am so moved I have no words," said Mr Singh.

Mr Ruru and his wife Janine Pere-Ruru met Mr Singh through his job as a salesman at Harvey Norman. He has a second part-time job working at the BNZ.

"He is such a lovely guy. He has a beautiful personality. We were humbled that he came around and asked us if we could help with a fundraiser and my husband was touched by his situation and decided to pay the airfare," said Mrs Pere-Ruru.

Her husband said Mr Singh had no insurance on the family home.

"He needs to go home. I want to do this because if we were in the same situation I would hope someone would help us out," he said.

Mrs Pere-Ruru said her husband had a soft heart and hoped the donation would inspire other forestry businesses to donate money for the people in the devastated Kathmandu region of Nepal.
