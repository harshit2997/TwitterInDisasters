The Rotary Club of Halstead is helping the earthquake relief effort in Nepal.

At an emergency meeting of the club, the members decided to sponsor a ShelterBox to be sent to the country following the earthquake on April 25.

ShelterBoxes typically includes a disaster relief tent for a family, thermal blankets and groundsheets, water storage and purification equipment, solar lamps, cooking utensils, a basic tool kit, mosquito nets and children’s activity pack.

They cost £590.

More than 8,000 people were killed and 19,000 were injured following the deadliest disaster in the country since 1934.

President Mike prince said: “The earthquake in Nepal was a terrible disaster which shocked us all and we are keen to lend our support, we believe providing shelter and clean water is the best way we can do this.”

Since the group agreed this, another earthquake hit the country on Tuesday.

More than 50 people were killed and thousands were injured.

If anyone would like to make a donation to the Rotary Club of Halstead to provide further aide to Nepal then contact Mike Prince on 01787 473924.
