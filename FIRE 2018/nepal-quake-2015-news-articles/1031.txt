NEW YORK - Mr Dan Fredinburg, a Google Inc executive based in California, was among those killed on Saturday in an avalanche on Mount Everest caused by a devastating earthquake in Nepal, the company said.

Mr Fredinburg was climbing the world's tallest peak with three other Google employees when the avalanche struck. None of his colleagues were injured, Mr Lawrence You, a company official, said in a statement.

Mr Fredinburg started at Google in 2007. He served as product manager and the head of privacy at Google X, the company’s secretive arm best known for “moonshot” projects such as the self-driving car.

Mr Fredinburg suffered a major head injury during an avalanche, his sister Megan said on social media. "His soul and his spirit will live on in so many of us," she said on an Instagram posting.

Mr Fredinburg, an experienced climber, was making his ascent up Everest with Jagged Globe, a company that organises mountain treks. In confirming Mr Fredinburg's death, the company said that two other team members suffered non-life threatening injuries in the avalanche that struck its base camp.

According to the technology blog Re/Code, Mr Fredinburg co-founded, in his spare time, Google Adventure. The project aims to “translate the Google Street View concept into extreme, exotic locations like the summit of Mount Everest or the Great Barrier Reef off Australia”, according to Startup Grind, a global startup community. Mr Feinberg also helped start Save the Ice, an organisation dedicated to raising awareness about global warming “through adventurous campaigns and events around the world”, according to its website.

Google said it has launched a “person finder” tool for Nepal to help people find loved ones in the aftermath of the quake and “is working to get updated satellite imagery to aid in the recovery effort”, Google says it is committing US$1 million to the quake response.

The actress Sophia Bush, who has appeared in photos with Mr Fredinburg posted by entertainment outlets, called him “one-of-a-kind” in a post on Instagram.

“A dancing robot who liked to ride dinosaurs and chase the sun and envision a better future for the world. His brain knew how to build it,” she wrote. “His heart was constantly evolving to push himself to make it so.”
