HM the King's Representative for Charity Works and Youth Affairs, Royal Charity Organisation (RCO) Board of Trustees' Chairman His Highness Shaikh Nasser bin Hamad Al-Khalifa will head the panel.

The committee has been tasked to dispatch humanitarian relief-aid and extend assistance to the friendly Nepalese people so as to alleviate their suffering and trauma following the violent earthquake which rocked their country.

Following the royal directives, HH Shaikh Nasser bin Hamad Al-Khalifa issued an edict appointing RCO Secretary-General Dr. Mustapha Al-Sayyed to chair the committee. RCO Assistant Secretary-General for Planning and Charity Resources Youssef Al-Yacoub has been named as vice-chairman of the panel which includes officials representing Manama-based Nepalese Ambassador, the Bahrain Red Crescent Society (BRCS), the Ministry of Health, RCO and other associations in Bahrain.

The committee will dispatch the first forty-ton consignment to the Nepalese Capital, Kathmandu, within the coming days, containing medicine, food items, tents and water purifiers. "The biggest challenge resides in rescuing the Nepalese people and alleviating the suffering of traumatized and bereaved families", Dr. Al-Sayyed said, stressing the importance of the lifeline in the aftermath of the devastating quake, the worst in more than 80 years, leaving thousands of people dead, injured and homeless.

Dr. Sayyed announced that a vigil would be held tomorrow (April29) at 08:00 pm at the Bahrain Karaleeya Samajam (BKS) in Segaya, Manama.
