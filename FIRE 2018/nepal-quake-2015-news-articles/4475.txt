Man heroically pulled from rubble 82 hours after Nepal earthquake
</headline>

<text>
A remarkable rescue in Nepal has been captured on camera with a man being pulled from the rubble almost four days after the major earthquake.

The 28-year-old said he kept banging against the rubble until someone finally responded, almost 82 hours after the quake.

He says he was surrounded by the dead - trapped, dehydrated, his nails went white and his lips cracked - and he'd given up hope until last night.

The rescue comes as emergency aid starts to reach remote communities that have been cut off.

It's now estimated a quarter of Nepal's 27.8 million population needs emergency assistance.

Nepalese police said today the death toll from the quake had reached 5,045. Another 19 were killed on the slopes of Mount Everest, while 61 died in neighbouring India.
