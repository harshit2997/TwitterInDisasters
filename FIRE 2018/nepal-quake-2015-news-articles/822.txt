A day after a massive earthquake shook Nepal, RPI (A) President Ramdas Athawale said he will donate a month’s salary to the Prime Minister’s relief fund for relief and rehabilitation of the victims. Shiv Sena which is part of BJP-led NDA government at the Centre here announced to donate salaries of its MPs for the relief and rehabilitation of the victims.

“Praying for the calm and the safety of all the people across the #Nepal earthquake radius and whoever has been affected by it,” Yuva Sena chief Aditya Thackeray tweeted.

“This is the worst tragedy that we have seen in the last many decades. It will take a long time for the wounds of those who have been affected to get healed. The least we can do is help and contribute to Prime Minister’s relief fund,” Athawale, who is Rajya Sabha MP told reporters here. “Thus, I have decided to contribute a month’s salary towards relief and rehabilitation of the affected families in Nepal,” he said.

Athawale said that he will flag off a truck loaded with food, water and clothes from Mumbai to Nepal tomorrow. He also appealed citizens to donate clothes to the victims of the natural disaster. “We will be sending a truck full of rice, fruits, pulses, biscuits, etc along with hundreds of water bottles and clothes. I request people to donate clothes for the victims. People can visit any local RPI shakha (unit) in their areas and the material will be sent across the border,” he added.

Over 2,000 people have been killed in a devastating temblor yesterday in Nepal, the worst earthquake in over 80 years in the Himalayan nation.

Ruling alliance partner in Maharashtra and the oldest ally of BJP, Shiv Sena has 18 Lok Sabha and three Rajya Sabha MPs. “All Shiv Sena MPs will give their 1 month’s salary to the Prime Minister’s relief fund for the Nepal earthquake relief. Giving our MP’s salaries to the PMO relief fund will enable it to go to the needed place, be it in India or Nepal. We are one,” he further tweeted.
