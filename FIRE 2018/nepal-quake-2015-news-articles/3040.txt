Even as the number of children who require immediate aid in Nepal continues to rise and is expected to be over 1.5 million, experts on Tuesday expressed concern that along with health hazards, the children living in camps with strangers are “vulnerable to exploitation.”

“As I look outside my window I see the overcast sky and it is likely to rain. The first thing that comes to mind is that many children have no place to stay. What they immediately require is safe shelter,” Rupa Joshi, communication manager of Nepal Unicef, told The Hindu from Kathmandu. Devendra Tak, national media manager of Save the Children, who is also posted in Nepal, expressed fears that once the children are out of their homes and live in camps with strangers they will be in danger.

“The entire support system for children, schools, immunisation programmes, pre-natal care for pregnant mothers, all have come to a halt due to the earthquake,” Mr. Tak said

Zach Zanek, deputy team leader of Save the Children in Nepal, said the children need psychological first aid (PSA) to come out of the trauma.

Along with relief material, these organisations are also distributing kits particularly for children. However, they said that considering the magnitude of the disaster, the material is far from adequate.

Meanwhile, the Rotary Club of Kolkata is sending 1000 shelter kits to Nepal. The kits consist of a trunk with 51 items, including clothing, tarpaulin, utensils, and other necessities for a distressed family.
