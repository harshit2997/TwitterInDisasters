The friends of a North Wales student who tragically lost her mum in the Nepal earthquake have rallied together to get her a flight home to be with her family.

Coleg Cambria student Maya Shyangba Hyolmo, 30, is originally from a village a few kilometres north east of the country’s capital Kathmandu which was left devastated by last Saturday’s disaster.

Her mum Jangmu Sherpa was one of more than 5,000 killed in the 7.9 magnitude quake, but her dad Kaji Lama luckily managed to escape.

Maya, who studies hairdressing at Coleg Cambria’s Deeside campus, last spoke to her dad on Monday and was told he had been left homeless with no food or clothes.

She knew her younger brother was on his way back to Nepal to help, but has not heard from either of them since.

Maya said: “I’ve not heard anything from my dad or village. I can’t contact them because all mobile phones are switched off and there is no landline or electricity.

“I want to go to Nepal to see my dad and pay my respects to my mum but I don’t know when, I was told it’s not suitable because there are no roads and everything is broken but I can’t make decisions until I speak to my dad and uncle.”

Maya, who lives in Chester, says she wants to go and help her family and the people in Sarka Thali Helambu, which is in the Sindhupalchok region of the country.

“If they want me to go earlier I will go soon as possible. But if they say wait for a while then I will wait and I’ll try to raise some money so I can help them to rebuild the house.”

Samantha Jones, of Flint, studies hairdressing with Maya in Connah’s Quay.

She has launched a bid to help her friend by raising money to fund Maya’s flights home which could cost more than £500.

As well as this, Samantha will also host a walk up Moel Famau for Community Action Nepal on June 7 to help those like Maya’s dad who have been affected by the disaster.

Maya said: “I feel so grateful. I never realised that I had such a good friends over here.

“All my friends, colleagues and classmates have been very supportive especially Samantha. Thank you all.”

A bank account has been set up for Maya’s flights, the details for which can be found on the Nepal Walk Facebook or by e-mailing Samantha at 21062870@cambria.ac.uk.
