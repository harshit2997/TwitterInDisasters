Hugh Sheridan's brother is safe in Nepal

Trekking in Nepal was something Zachary Sheridan always wanted to do and he went there "on instinct", his brother Will says.

Mr Sheridan was reported missing by his family and his other brother, actor Hugh Sheridan, is on his way to the earthquake-ravaged country to find him.

But Will says Zachary has now made contact through a Facebook update and a text message and the whole family is relieved he's safe.

"It's great news," he told ABC radio on Tuesday.

"I've been quietly confident he was okay but just out of range. That was thankfully right."

Will Sheridan says his brother had always loved walking and trekking and took the opportunity to head to Nepal after completing his university studies in Hong Kong.

"At the end of that he just thought it's an opportunity to go and do something he's always wanted to do and trek in Nepal.

"He probably just saw it on a noticeboard at the university and just went on instinct.

"By all accounts he's been having a great experience but now the reality will be starting to sink in."

In his Facebook update on Wednesday, Zachary Sheridan said at the time of the earthquake he was in Gokyo, about 140km northeast of Kathmandu, but was now safe.

"To everyone concerned, thank you for thinking of me," the post said.
