Nepal Donors — ‘I’ll Get You Later’
</headline>

<text>
After the massive earthquake in Nepal came the swift outpouring of aid promises from around the globe. What couldn’t be undone might at least be mended. And nations from financially beleaguered Spain to powerful Germany to neighboring India promised aid. Much was sent, but far short of what’s needed.

The U.N. appealed to the international community for $415 million to support the Nepal relief efforts. Jamie McGoldrick, who is the top U.N. official in Nepal, says the agency has received $22 million so far. It’s estimated that 400,000 families are in some form of distress. Almost 8,00 people died as a result of the quake, which occurred on April 25.
