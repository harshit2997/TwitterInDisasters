A stream of generous donations in Honiton have resulted in more than £1,800 being raised to help earthquake victims in Nepal.

Members of the Otter Valley Rotary Club needed to act quickly to gather donations for ShelterBox to provide emergency supplies for the millions affected by the disaster, which has now claimed more than 7,000 lives.

But their plans were hindered last week when Sainsbury’s in Ottery St Mary refused to issue permission for collections to take place in its Hind Street store due to a change in policy.

Despite this, teams went out to the town square, McColls in West Hill and Tesco in Honiton to raise the money.

President of the club, Chris Highnam, said: “As with all emergency appeals, getting into the best places to collect and then raising club members to do the collecting can be quite challenging, but in this case we hit the right note and are very pleased to have this magnificent result and we wish to thank all who contributed.”

The total will pay for three boxes containing vital emergency supplies and kit to be sent by ShelterBox to the disaster-stricken country.

Members of Otter Valley Rotary have sent a poster of thanks in Honiton Tesco for shoppers to see.

Kim Hutchinson, community champion for Honiton Tesco, praised the ‘amazing’ Tesco customers who dug deep to support the Nepal appeal.

She said: “We were overwhelmed by the generosity of our customers.

“They really pull out the stops when something matters. We have got some amazingly generous people in town.”

Kim told the Herald that following the appeal, club members made a return to the store to thank them

She added: “They were absolutely delighted to have raised £1,337 over the course of two days. This shows – by how much they took – how much people care about something.

“This must have touched a chord somewhere – we are chuffed and have invited them back again for future fundraising if they need it.”
