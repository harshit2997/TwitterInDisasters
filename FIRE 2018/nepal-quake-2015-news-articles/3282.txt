NAROOMA High School principal Tony Fahey has survived the devastating Nepal earthquake that has now claimed 4000 lives with the death toll increasing every day.

Mr Fahey contacted the Narooma News on Tuesday night via email from the capital city Kathmandu letting us know he was okay.

“Just thought I would let you know that while taking part as a volunteer in a Rotary trip to Nepal organised by Rotary Club of Orange Daybreak,” he wrote.

“I have been through the earthquake disaster.

The team had spent 10 days in a village called Maidi working with teachers and health workers.

“We returned to Kathmandu on Friday and spent Saturday morning at the Australian Embassy for ANZAC Day before heading out for some R&R.

“We have survived the earthquake unscathed and are currently staying at the Kathmandu Guest House while we wait for return flights home, most likely on Thursday.

“There is a lot of devastation as I am sure you are aware. The people here are numb and life is slowly, very slowly returning to normal.

“Living through seething such as this really puts a different perspective on lots of things and makes you realise how important are the simple things in life such as family and friends and how fortunate we truly are.

“Especially after talking with locals and a Frenchman who survived a landslide and dig his way out with his bare hands and a spoon and who now has no idea where his wife and family are as they were out hiking at the time.”

Also on the trip and caught up in the disaster was Doug Reckord of Kalaru at Tathra.

Meanwhile back in Narooma, local chef Rosh Shrestha at Lynch’s Restaurant says his family back in Kathmandu is safe, but the quake has had a huge impact on the city and nation, and they have no food, water or electricity.

He is organising a fundraiser dinner at Lynch’s Hotel for Friday, May 18, and stay tuned to the Narooma News for more information.
