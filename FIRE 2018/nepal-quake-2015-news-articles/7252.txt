A mother in Nepal has named her baby in honour of a Nova Scotia nurse who delivered the boy.

Lynn Henderson is a nurse and midwife from Bridgetown, in the Annapolis Valley, who went to Nepal with the Red Cross after a large earthquake rocked the country in April.

She helped a 20-year-old woman give birth to a healthy boy, who the mom named Leilyn in Henderson's honour. The birth took place at a mobile hospital in Tatopani, Nepal.

Dan Bedell, a spokesperson for the Atlantic region for the Canadian Red Cross, said a team of more than 20 Red Cross staff went to Nepal. They split up between the communities of Dhunche and Tatopani.

Tatopani had a small hospital before it was destroyed by the earthquakes. This is why the team chose that location, and they set up there on May 8 or May 9, Bedell said.

Bedell said Leilyn was the first baby born at the mobile hospital after the Red Cross set up. Several babies have been born since, he said.

Another mom let Henderson name her baby girl. Henderson chose the name Teesha.

That delivery happened just after the second major earthquake was reported on Tuesday.

"Within the hours after that â€¦ there started to be major rock slides in the mountains just above that village," Bedell said.

The Red Cross team made the decision to evacuate Tatopani, and are now working in Kathmandu.

"I believe they're hoping to return to Tatopani, or at least some place close by there, as soon as possible," he said.
