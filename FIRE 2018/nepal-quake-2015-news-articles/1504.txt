About 4,000 Chinese tourists remain stranded in quake-hit Nepal as airlines race to evacuate them following Saturday's earthquake, according to the China National Tourism Administration.

Four Chinese citizens are confirmed dead and 10 seriously injured in the Himalayan country, where the death toll has climbed to more than 3,000, CCTV said on its official Sina Weibo account. At least 20 have lost their lives and four are missing in Tibet.

As of 4 pm on Sunday, Chinese airlines had evacuated more than 1,000 nationals from Nepal.

Currently, Chinese carriers are able to bring about 1,200 people home every day.

The Civil Aviation Administration of China has asked airlines to prepare more flights to Nepal and prioritize the transport of passengers and humanitarian aid.

The Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs has advised people not to visit Nepal in the near future.
