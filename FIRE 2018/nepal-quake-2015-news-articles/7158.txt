KATHMANDU, Nepal (AP) — Fresh avalanches have forced rescuers in a village buried by a landslide in northern Nepal to stop searching for bodies in the aftermath of the devastating earthquake.

Government administrator Gautam Rimal said the avalanches on Friday and Saturday made the work dangerous for police and army rescuers.

So far 120 bodies have been recovered from the scenic village on a popular trekking route north of Nepal’s capital, Kathmandu.

The April 25 earthquake that shook Nepal killed more than 8,000 people and injured more than 16,000 others as it flattened mountain villages and destroyed buildings and archaeological sites in the Himalayan region.

The United Nations says international response to the humanitarian crisis has been slow and tens of thousands of people are still living in the open.
