The death toll has continued to rise as allies from all the over the world come together to help the people of Nepal since it's deadly earthquake Saturday.

According to The New York Times, the 7.8 earthquake left officials changing their preliminary death toll from 886 to 1,246 in a matter of hours on Saturday afternoon. All of the deaths were from the city's main point of the quake in Katmandu.

At least 4,108 people remain injured. Officials say they were aware of the earthquake due to the pressure and grinding between Eurasia and India's tectonic plates. The moment set off avalanches in Mount Everest, killing a total of 13 people.

An additional 34 deaths were reported in Northern Indian as buildings in Tibet and Bangladesh were reported to have been shaken during the quake's after effects. Twelve aftershocks also followed with a magnitude of 6.6 each, the Unites States Geological Survey reported.

Families have taken shelter outside in fear of more collapsed buildings. Many of the city's oldest buildings include the hospitals, which are currently low on trauma kits and other medical supplies. Doctors and nurses have taken their services to the streets to help victims with wounds and severed limbs.

A 200-ft watchtower also came down along as other monumental areas were harmed. One resident says the destruction was a lot to take in.

"I was here yesterday, I was here the day before yesterday and it was there," he said. "Today it's just gone. Last night, from my terrace, I was looking at the tower. And today I was at the tower â€” and there is no tower."

In a public statement, Secretary of State John Kerry awarded $1 million in humanitarian efforts to be released immediately to Nepal. Other countries have also stepped up including China to assist with the effects of the earthquake.
