NEW DELHI (VNS) – Officials of the Vietnamese embassy in India departed for Kathmandu this morning to help Vietnamese citizens, who have been stranded in Nepal after the earthquake last Saturday.

The embassy's Minister Counsellor Tran Quang Tuyen said 16 Vietnamese tourists were staying in Kathmandu, besides some others about whom the embassy was yet to get information.

Officials would assist the Vietnamese citizens to reach New Delhi, from where they could board a connecting flight to Viet Nam, Tuyen said
