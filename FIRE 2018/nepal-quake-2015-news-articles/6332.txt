Laxmi Prasad Dhakal, a spokesman of the ministry, said the 7.5- magnitude quake with an epicenter at Dolakha district has killed 65 with 1,936 reportedly injured till Wednesday morning.

Dolkaha district, some 130 km east of the capital, suffered the maximum number of human loss as well as infrastructures damage.

Most of the cracked buildings, including houses, government offices and schools, have been badly destroyed by the latest quake.

According to the National Seismological Center, five aftershocks with magnitude of 4 to 6 were recorded on Wednesday.

More than 8,000 people were killed in a massive 7.9-magnitude quake on April 25 and some 17,000 were injured.

Nepal Army, Nepal Police and Armed Police Force along with rescue teams from different countries have been deployed for the rescue operation in such worst-hit districts as Kavre, Sindhupalchowk, Rasuwa and Nuwakot among others.

However, landslides triggered by the earthquake have obstructed roads and relief distribution in parts of the Himalayan country.
