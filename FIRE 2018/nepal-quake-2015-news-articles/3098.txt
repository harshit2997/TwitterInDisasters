A worker for a Western Pennsylvania-based watchmaker feared missing in the aftermath of the earthquake in Nepal is alive and well, the company founder confirmed Monday.

Namgel Sherpa was on a trek north of Kathmandu during the temblor, said Michael Kobold, 36.

However, a second employee of Kobold Nepal, a subsidiary of Kobold Expedition Tools in Volant, Mercer County, is missing.

“We are, at this point, fearing for the worst,” Kobold said.

He said the family of the missing worker, a watch strap maker, is unaccounted for. He declined to share the employee's name.

All six Nepalese workers at the Kathmandu-based group lost their homes in the earthquake, Kobold said. He expects his factory there was demolished.

Kobold said he plans to travel to Nepal as soon as he can.

In the meantime, he and Western Pennsylvanians with Nepal ties are scrambling to help the impoverished country. The nationally known Soarway Foundation — backed by Kobold — raised at least $180,000 in pledges in 24 hours after the quake, part of a multimillion-dollar effort to ship ambulances, firetrucks and emergency equipment to Nepal.

The Jewish Federation of Greater Pittsburgh brought in more than $3,200 from 28 donors in less than a day, said marketing director Adam Hertzman.

“The federation helps out in every crisis. I think the Jewish community feels this one particularly acutely” because of the large Israeli community in Nepal and Pittsburgh ties to the country, Hertzman said.

An estimated 4,000 to 5,000 Bhutanese refugees who are ethnic Nepalese have migrated to the Pittsburgh area since 2008, said Leslie Aizenman, the refugee and immigrant services director at the Jewish Family & Children's Service of Pittsburgh.

The local Nepalese community is planning a vigil for noon Wednesday in Market Square, Downtown, said Dipesh R. Bista, 33, a native Nepali who's an internal medicine physician at UPMC. He said his family in his home country is safe but worried.

“The need right now is for supplies more than anything else,” Bista said.
