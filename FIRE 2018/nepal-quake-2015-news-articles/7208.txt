Employees and workmen of the world's largest coal miner, Coal India Limited (CIL), on Friday contributed Rs.5 crore to the Prime Minister's National Relief Fund for quake ravaged Nepal and some of the Indian states.

CIL chairman Sutirtha Bhattacharya handed over a cheque to union Coal Minister Piyush Goyal here.

"The contribution by the workmen and the employees shows the compassion and the heart of the company. It's unfortunate what has happened in Nepal and to some extent in Bihar. The second quake is really very disturbing.

"I am sure this fund will go a long way in making people come out of their distress although the disaster is so bad that nothing can rally ameliorate it quickly enough," said Goyal.

Goyal subsequently made Bhattacharya commit a contribution of Rs.6 crore to the PM relief fund.

"I would also urge the chairman and the managing director of CIL (Bhattacharya) to consider his contribution along with that of the employees to the relief fund. Can I assume that five crore will now add up to make it 10 crore," asked Goyal to which Bhattacharya nodded in the affirmative.

"More auspicious figure is 11, so you should make it six crore and make it Rs. 11 crore and send it to the PM relief fund," added Goyal.

Christened the CIL relief fund, under the initiative Rs.2 per month is deducted from all the employees of the Maharatna Company.
