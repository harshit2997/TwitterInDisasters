Johannesburg - The South African search and rescue team that hurried to Nepal’s aid after it was struck by an earthquake left the capital, Kathmandu, on Tuesday night.

The team was part of South African relief-response organisation Gift of the Givers. It comprised paramedics, firefighters, and search and rescue personnel. Gift of the Givers co-ordinator Dr Ahmed Bham said the team had been plagued by challenges throughout their time in Nepal.

Four sniffer dogs and their handlers had to be left at OR Tambo when they could not be accommodated on the aircraft. Their situation worsened when their luggage was left behind in Singapore as the plane could not take the cargo.

Bham said the team had performed well despite all the obstacles. “The team experienced a tough time here,” he said.

The medical team would leave Kathmandu on Wednesday evening to go to other areas to continue their work in hospitals to help clear the backlog of injured earthquake survivors.
