Neelima says that although the experience was frightening, she will not give up her passion



Hyderabad: "The beautiful surroundings all along, which pleasantly greeted us when we were going up, vanished by the time we were returning in the same route. What all we saw was beauty and pleasance in our upward trekking. But it was all misery that we were forced to see. It was unimaginable," quips 28-year-old techie Puthota Neelima, who returned to India with a lot of depressing tales from Nepal, abruptly winding up her Himalayan trekking expedition.

"Still, I am not upset. I will surely go for Himalayan trekking next year. This year, I got to know the conditions", asserts she upon arriving safely in Delhi by an Indian Air Force flight on Friday.

An employee of Cognizant Tech Solutions in Hyderabad, Neelima went for Himalayan trekking along with seven other Indians on April 19. She was in touch with her parents till the day before the earthquake. She was 4,600 meters above from mean sea level when the quake occurred on April 25.

"We all had vomiting sensation and felt dizzy. For some time, we felt it is common as we go up and because of mountain sickness. But, we learned that there was a massive earthquake", recalled Neelima. Soon, the communication systems broke down, snapping ties with the rest of the world. "I already told my parents that the communication system would be weak as we go up hence, I was not much worried. But, I knew they would be worried about me after knowing there was an earthquake". She said the aftershocks were more powerful than the earthquake.

"We came down very fast. We were trekking six to eight hours every day as we were doing on our way up but we were covering more distance this time. All of us were getting innumerable calls from our families, friends and near and dear ones enquiring about our safety," she said. Souraiah, Neelima's father, said, "We were confident she was safe. But we were happy when we heard her voice on Tuesday (April 28)".
