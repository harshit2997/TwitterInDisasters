Advertising Association of Nepal reaches out to Indian ad fraternity for quake relief

In a fervent plea, the Vice-President of AAN, Ujaya Shakya, seeks all possible help to provide relief to the tragedy-struck nation and its people

Two devastating earthquakes in Nepal have left several thousands dead and many more who need immediate help in the form of medical supplies, food, safe drinking water and shelter. While relief material is pouring in from across the world, there is still a lot left to be done.

At this critical hour, the Advertising Association of Nepal (AAN) is also coordinating with the Nepal Government to accumulate an Earthquake Relief Fund. All the member agencies of the Association are contributing. The Association has also appealed to the international community to come forward and help Nepal in every possible way during this tragic time.

In a statement issued, Ujaya Shakya, Vice-President of Advertising Association of Nepal, said, “Kathmandu Valley was a city of temples. Now it is a city of tents. This is a very unfortunate time for most Nepalese across the world. On Saturday, April 25 at 11:56 NST onwards things have drastically changed for all of us. It has inbuilt a fear within us on every occasion of aftershocks which has been continuously taking place even today.”

Along with terrible loss of life, the country suffered severe damage of Durbar Squares, UNESCO World Heritage sites, in all three important cities within Kathmandu valley – Kathmandu, Bhaktapur, Lalitpur, ancient townships with a public square preserved almost intact for centuries, but now in ruins. These cultural sites are part of the skeleton of Kathmandu valley and the focal point for urban Nepal.

Shakya pointed out, “There is also the economic aspect of these sites because almost 10 per cent of Nepal’s economy depends on tourism. The earthquake has struck Nepal on so many levels. Personally, culturally, historically and socially and the future of tourism – the very livelihoods of certain section of Nepalese are threatened. Therefore, it is an obligation for both Nepalese and the world to restore these structures in its former glory despite of both technical and monetary challenges. It is just simply impossible to imagine Kathmandu valley without them.”

Shakya has requested to the Indian advertising fraternity, “If anyone wants to help Nepal, please reach out to the Advertising Association of Nepal office in Kathmandu and we will guide you in the process.”
