Update, approximately 6 p.m.: Noah O'Brien called his family today. He is safe in Malaysia, according to his sister Erin. Additional details weren't immediately available.

Earlier report:

A weekend excursion to Nepal turned into a nightmare for a Cincinnati man who was in Malaysia on business.

Noah O'Brien, 35, of West End, called his mother around 4 a.m. Saturday as a magnitude 7.8 earthquake shook and split open the ground beneath him.

"I just missed death by a few seconds," O'Brien told Nancy Simpson. "Earthquakes are destroying everything around me in Nagarkot right now."

Nagarkot is a small mountain village just outside Nepal's capital Kathmandu.

O'Brien told Simpson that his money and cell phone were lost as he ran, but he held on to his laptop and passport.

After the earthquake, O'Brien hitchhiked to Kathmandu where a family took him in and allowed him to use a phone, his sister, Erin O'Brien, said.

Noah O'Brien was very active on Facebook after the earthquake but hasn't posted anything since he shared a picture of rubble and a destroyed building Sunday afternoon.

"Most of the small towns we passed through were nothing but rubble," he wrote in a post. "There is no electricity or water here in the capital. A family has taken me in for the night, but the buildings on both sides of their house have collapsed. Right now, the men and women are debating whether we sleep outside or inside."

His family has not heard from O'Brien since Saturday.

"My hope is that he has just run out of power on all his devices," Erin O'Brien said.

One of Noah O'Brien's last Facebook posts said that his laptop had only an hour of battery life left.

The post also said he was scheduled to fly back to Malaysia on Sunday, but that flight was cancelled according to Erin O'Brien.

Noah O'Brien works at Emery Oleochemicals, a chemical plant in Winton Hills. The company sent him to Malaysia to train new workers, Erin O'Brien said.

She registered her brother with the U.S. Embassy and is working with Emery Oelochemical's Malaysian affiliates to get him home.

Noah O'Brien was supposed to graduate from Ohio University on May 2 with a Bachelor of Science in applied management, said Erin O'Brien.

She doubts he will make it back in time.

"We are hoping that he is safe and sitting in the airport waiting for a flight," O'Brien's mother, Simpson posted on Facebook. "Keep your fingers crossed."
