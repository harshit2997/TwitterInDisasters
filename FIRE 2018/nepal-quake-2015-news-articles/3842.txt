A Calgary woman who’s been stranded in Nepal since a devastating and deadly 7.8 earthquake is headed home.

Tamara McLeod’s family says she has been rescued from Briddhim in Lang Tang Provincial Park, and was on a bus to Kathmandu.

She missed the first flight out on a Canadian Forces plane and sister Michelle Dack, says once Tamara arrives in the capital, she will need help getting a temporary passport.

Dack says the Canadian Medical Assistance Team and the Nepal Army have been a tremendous help.

Dack says she is just happy her sister is safe.

“Absolutely relieved, and I’m giddy. I’m totally giddy,” she said.

Tamara’s mother spoke to her on the phone briefly, and Dack says, she sounded enthusiastic and cannot wait to get home.
