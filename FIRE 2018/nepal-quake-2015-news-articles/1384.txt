A devastating earthquake that rattled Nepal two days ago has left at least 3,218 people dead and around 6,500 injured, authorities said on Monday.

Rameshwor Dangal, head of Nepal's disaster management division, came out with the latest casualty figures as rescuers stepped up work across the Himalayan nation.

Tens of thousands of people spent a second consecutive night outside their homes as frightening aftershocks continued following a 7.9 magnitude quake on Saturday and one measuring 6.7 on the Richter scale on Sunday.

Xinhua quoted officials as warning that the death toll was expected to go up further.

The cabinet declared that 29 out of 70 districts had been declared crisis zones. The worst hit area in the quake is the Kathmandu Valley.

The Saturday quake also jolted India, Bangladesh and Tibet.

Nepal has appealed for assistance from the international community both to save those who may still be trapped under the debris and to rebuild the country.
