Lexington students, staff raise money for custodian's family in Nepal
</headline>

After the news broke that a strong earthquake had hit Nepal Lafayette High School custodian Devi Adhikari tried to do contact his family still living there.

"I tried to send a text message, I tried to email them, I tried to send a message on Facebook but I was not getting a response," Adhikari said.

Adhikari has worked at Lafayette High School in Lexington since 2009.

Before that he was living in Nepal with his family.

No one in Devi's family died but their home was destroyed.

"Right now they even don't know what they have because all of the houses are gone," Adhikari said.

Members of the student council began collecting donations last week to send to Devi's family.

"Everyone was willing to give at least a little bit of something because we're really a big family here at Lafayette," Lafayette High School senior Alex Francke said. "It was really nice to see how many people wanted to give whatever they could to help out one of our family members."

By the end of the week, faculty and students raised more than $750 to send to Devi's family. He says his family in Nepal can buy food for the next several months with the money from the students and faculty.
