Nepal earthquake: Jeremy Clarkson's former brother in-law among the stranded
</headline>

Keith Diplock was trekking between capital Kathmandu and Everest base camp as part of a “bucket list” trip of a lifetime when disaster struck.

Axed Top Gear frontman Jezza, 55, was wed to business manager Frances for 21 years, before she filed for divorce last year.

Keith, 71, is married to Frances’ sister, Rosemary – who was one of the petrolhead’s “biggest supporters”.

But Rosemary has revealed how the ex-couple are “better off apart”.

After an agonising 24 hours of waiting for news following the deadly 7.8-magnitude quake, Rosemary finally heard her hubby was safe. She said: “As far as I know, he is fine and well.

“Thankfully they were not at base camp when the earthquake hit so they were lucky. “I was only too grateful to hear the news - they are a hearty bunch but they're not the youngest. "

I am quite sad for him actually because it was going to be a trip of a lifetime.

"Considering his age, it is unlikely he will have another opportunity."
