Red Cross, Mercy Relief appeal for urgent donations
</headline>

<text>
Singapore humanitarian organisations are sending relief supplies and emergency assistance to Nepal, and are appealing for urgent donations from the public.

The Himalayan state was rocked by a 7.8-magnitude earthquake on Saturday that has left more than 2,300 dead.

In a statement yesterday, the Singapore Red Cross said it will send $50,000 worth of relief items and emergency supplies to Nepal.

Mercy Relief, a humanitarian non-governmental organisation, said it will deploy a preliminary disaster response team of two to Kathmandu, Nepal's capital. It will ascertain ground needs and procure an initial batch of relief supplies, said the organisation, adding that $60,000 had been dedicated as an "initial tranche" for relief efforts.

Both the Singapore Red Cross and Mercy Relief are appealing for donations. The Government has committed $100,000 to the Red Cross as a seed contribution in its donation drive, the Singapore Red Cross said.

To donate to the Red Cross' efforts, members of the public can go to the Red Cross House at 15, Penang Lane, Singapore 238486, from 9am to 6pm on weekdays.

They can also make cheques out to the Singapore Red Cross Society, indicating the Nepal Earthquake Relief Fund and their name, contact number and address on the back. These should be posted to the Red Cross House.

To donate to Mercy Relief's efforts, members of the public can make cheques out to Mercy Relief Limited, with "Nepal Earthquake Relief 2015" written on the reverse. They should be mailed to Block 160, Lorong 1 Toa Payoh, #01-1568, Singapore 310160.

Cash donations will also be accepted at that location, while bank transfers can be made to Mercy Relief's DBS current account 054-900741-2.

The death toll in Nepal climbed as rescuers sifted through the rubble of levelled buildings at the weekend.

Strong aftershocks continue to be felt, said Singapore Red Cross secretary-general Benjamin William.

"Many are living in fear, unable to return to their homes. Damage to roads and the airport means that getting relief and aid to these communities is also going to pose a great logistical challenge," he added.

The Singapore Red Cross is working with the International Committee of the Red Cross to assist those trying to contact their family members in Nepal.

Those looking to contact relatives in affected areas can register at http://familylinks. icrc.org/nepal-earthquake or call the Singapore Red Cross hotline on 6664-0501.
