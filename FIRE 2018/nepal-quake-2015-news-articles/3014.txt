NOIDA: Nepalese students in city-based academic institutions are facing a financial crisis, after nationalized banks in their hometowns suffered system failure due to Saturday's massive earthquake. Several beleaguered Nepalese students said they were unable to withdraw money from their bank accounts due to glitches.Sharda University student Mandeep Kharal, who has an account in Everest Bank, said, "I was refused any transaction at the ATM."Kaushik Bhattacharya from Kuleshwar, Kathmandu, said he has an account in Nepal SBI, a public sector bank in which State Bank of India has a stake, and in which most Nepalese students in the city hold accounts. "Since Saturday, I have not been able to check my account or withdraw money," said Bhattacharya, who has completed his MBBS and is interning at Sharda University.Rohini Singh from Kathmandu, and a biotechnology student at Amity University, said she had withdrawn money on Saturday, the day the earthquake hit Nepal. "I have sufficient money with me. But there are others who don't have any," she said.A senior SBI official, however, said there is no problem for customers accessing bank accounts from India. "There may be issues with local ATMs. Nepal SBI's core functions were the first to resume operations after the quake, restoring services in 56 of 78 ATMs and 56 of 62 offices," he said.University officials said they have so far not received any request from students regarding financial help. Sharda University has around 500 students from Nepal. Chancellor P K Gupta said they're grief-stricken. "We've postponed their semester exams till May, We'd like to address their financial problems, but haven't received any requests," Gupta said. Amity University vice-president Savita Mehta said college staff has not received any request from students either, but assured help if needed.
