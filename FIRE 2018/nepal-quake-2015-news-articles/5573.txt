Indonesian humanitarian assistance in Nepal most thorough

Jakarta (ANTARA News) - Indonesias humanitarian aid in Nepal is considered the most thorough, Director of the Protection of Indonesian Citizens and Indonesian Legal Entities of the Foreign Affairs Ministry Lalu Muhammad Iqbal said.



"For humanitarian assistance, we focused on the provision of hospital tents and surgical equipment. We also brought along a doctor. Our assistance was considered the most thorough," Iqbal stated here on Thursday.



According to the ministry official, in preparing humanitarian aid, which was part of earthquake disaster relief efforts in Nepal, teams from Indonesia remembered their experience in the aftermath of the 5.9-magnitude earthquake in Yogyakarta to determine what kind of assistance would be required.



"We learnt from our post-earthquake experience in Yogyakarta and Aceh. As many people had suffered fractures then, we sent a number of orthopedic specialists," Iqbal explained.



The humanitarian aid brought by the Indonesian team consisted of food, medical equipment and supplies, and medicines, he affirmed.



"Everything needed for treatment was brought to Nepal. We expected the team to be able to provide medical assistance to the victims of the earthquake," Iqbal remarked.



He also pointed out that even though the Indonesian team was earlier mandated to operate in Nepal for two weeks, their stay may be extended to up to three months if requested by the government of Nepal.



"Until now, there has been no formal request for the team to stay there for three months, but they were considered very useful and needed," Iqbal said.



The Indonesian government had sent a relief team to Nepal with two main tasks---delivering humanitarian aid for the people of Nepal and evacuating Indonesian citizens there.



The humanitarian assistance team coordinated by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs comprised ministry staff, as well as personnel of the National Disaster Management Agency (BNPB), the Indonesian Military and the Indonesian Red Cross (PMI).(*)
