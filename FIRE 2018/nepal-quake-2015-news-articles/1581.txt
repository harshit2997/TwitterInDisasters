Ky Red Cross Chapters Participate in Earthquake Relief Efforts
</headline>

<text>
Many Kentuckians may be seeking to lend financial assistance to the earthquake ravaged area in Nepal. One option is through contributions to the American Red Cross.

Bluegrass Chapter Director Terry Burkhart says there are online and traditional mailing options for donors.

"We would say whatever is most convenient for the donor; if it's easier to just go online and make the donation that's great," said Burkhart. "If you'd rather be more comfortable providing the check through our office, that works too. Either works just fine."

Burkhart says it's not likely any central Kentucky Red Cross volunteers will be traveling to Nepal in the near future. He says the training for that type of relief work is unique to the current needs and differs from ongoing volunteer training efforts.

"The American Red Cross has made an initial commitment of $300,000 for the relief effort and we would just be supporting the Nepal Red Cross Society there and they would know how best to utilize that financial assistance," added Burkhart.

Burkhart says other similar contributions are coming from Red Cross societies around the world. The national Red Cross organization says the emergency relief agency is providing remote and information management support to help obtain a more accurate assessment of the destruction. Donations can be made at redcross.org.
