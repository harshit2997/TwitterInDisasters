Specially trained/equipped Disaster Assistance Response Team (DART) on its way

CALGARY, April 25, 2015 /CNW/ - Samaritan's Purse is sending staff and emergency supplies to the scene of a massive 7.8-magnitude earthquake in Nepal that hit Saturday morning, killing at least 1,000 people and destroying many more homes and other buildings.

Samaritan's Purse and its ministry partners are assessing the damage caused by the quake that struck between the densely populated capital, Kathmandu, and the city of Pokhara. People throughout the region felt tremors, and the rising death toll is stretching into India, Bangladesh, and on Mount Everest.

The Christian international relief organization has deployed a Disaster Assistance Response Team (DART)—including experienced participants from Canada—from our international headquarters in North Carolina. The response will include emergency shelter, water, hygiene kits, medical care, and other relief.

The earthquake is reportedly the worst to hit the poverty-stricken South Asian nation in more than 80 years. It began before noon local time Saturday. A 6.6-magnitude aftershock hit an hour later, and smaller aftershocks have continued to ripple through the region for hours, leaving people devastated and fearful.

"We are urgently asking Canadians to partner with us through their donations and prayer as we rush to provide help for the suffering and grieving people of Nepal," said Fred Weiss, Executive Director of Samaritan's Purse Canada. "They desperately need the help of every Canadian right now."

Donations Needed: Canadians can donate to Samaritan's Purse disaster relief work in Nepal and around the world donate by calling 1-800-663-6500 or visiting SamaritansPurse.ca

Canadian DART member available for interviews: One of Samaritan's Purse Canada's Calgary-based managers, with extensive disaster response experience who has traveled widely in Nepal in the past, has arrived in London, England, and is arranging a flight to Nepal. Bruce Piercey is available for phone interviews at 403-971-9196 or bpiercey@samaritan.ca.
