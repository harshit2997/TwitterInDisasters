The World Organization of Students Youth (WOSY) organized a candle light march at Jantar Mantar on Thursday to pay homage to the victims of Nepal earthquake.

WOSY is an organization of foreign students who come to India for studies. Nearly 100 students from Mangolia, Iran, Afghanistan, Nepal participated in the candle light march.

These students are also raising funds for the Prime Minister's relief fund to rebuild Nepal.

"Whatever funds we are collecting will go to the PM relief fund. The collected relief materials will be sent to Nepal through Nepal Embassy in Delhi. As of now we have collected good amount of money from college campuses, malls, big and small shops and from 32 districts all over India where we are having a good hold," told Rohit Chahal, National Executive Council member, ABVP.
