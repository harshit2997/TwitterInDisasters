More than 2500 Indians have reached Raxaul on the Indo-Nepal border from earthquake-hit Nepal since last night even as the toll due to the high intensity earthquake in Bihar climbed up to 58 while 180 others were injured.

The stranded Indians were given food packets on their arrival and sent to their respective destinations by trains and buses, a senior official said.

Meanwhile, Principal Secretary Disaster Management Department Vyas Jee told PTI one more person died in West Champaran taking the toll to 58 while about 180 are injured.

Vijay Sinha, Commandant of 9th battalion of NDRF based at Bihta in Patna district, said three battalions each comprising about 45 personnel left for Kathmandu by road late last night to join relief and rescue operation in the Himalayan country.

Three more NDRF teams are ready at Bihta to move after receiving instructions, he said.

A report from Sitamarhi said a team of doctors has been deployed at all the entry points on the Indo-Nepal border in the district at Bargania, Bushita, Sonebarsa and Bhihta to attend to the people arriving from Nepal.

A report from Darbhanga said minister in-charge of the district Baidyanath Sahni and Special District Magistrate Anand Kishore were closely monitoring relief operations in the district.

“Readymade food packets were provided in relief camps to more than 2500 persons who arrived at Raxual from Nepal since last night,” In-charge District Magistrate of East Champaran district Bharat Dubey, who is camping at Raxual, told PTI Tuesday.

Ten buses were sent to Pokhra by the state government but since not many people were stranded there, only one bus load of persons were returning in the bus to Raxual, Vyas Jee said.

As announced by Chief Minister Nitish Kumar, a total of 30 buses have left for Kathmandu this morning to bring back stranded citizens, Vyas Jee said.

The Chief Minister is scheduled to visit Raxual this afternoon to take stock of relief work as there is maximum flow of people from Nepal to India through Raxual, Chief Minister Office said.

Vyas Jee confirmed a report of eight people arriving from Nepal side to Bargania border in Sitamarhi district who were also provided immediate relief and sent to their respective destinations.
