Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Hua Chunying says the latest batch of Chinese relief materials is expected to be delivered to Nepal by early next week at the latest.

"We began delivering our second batch of relief supplies weighing 360 tons to quake-stricken Nepal this afternoon. All the supplies are expected to get to the Himalayan country within four days. A total of 100 tons of emergency supplies provided by the Chinese military arrived in Nepal on May 2nd and May 3rd."

Three Chinese military helicopters are also operational in Nepal.

Their goal is to transport both relief goods and transfer the injured to hospital.

The People's Liberation Army is heading the rescue mission.

Officers in-charge admit they are facing a number of challenges.

"We have seen on TV the power lines are mostly tangled and in messy shape. We also face problems with objects on the ground, particularly when we're transporting and delivering disaster relief goods at a lower altitude."

Meanwhile, one of the main goals of the Chinese teams on-the-ground in Nepal is epidemic prevention.

Disease control experts and disinfection professionals have been focusing on water quality testing.

Liu Guoxiang with the Chongqing Third Military Medical University says water quality is a major concern.

"Most of the water is not fit for drinking. We are trying to remind people of that."

Despite the concerns about the local water supplies, the World Health Organization is suggesting the likelihood of a mass epidemic outbreak in Nepal remains minimal.

However, there are concerns the unseasonal rains which continue to hit many parts of Nepal won't let-up before the annual monsoon season hits.

If this is the case, it may pose a greater challenge.

The death toll from the earthquake two-Saturdays ago stands at close to 77-hundred.
