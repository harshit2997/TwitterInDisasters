Rajasthan today sent a 41-member team of doctors and para-medical staff along with medical supplies for relief operations in earthquake-hit Nepal.

Rajasthan Medical and Health Minister R S Rathore flagged off the team at the Health Directorate here, an official spokesperson said.

The team has 16 mobile surgical units, 25 doctors of CMHO Jaipur and para-medical staff, he said, adding some retired doctors have also joined the team.

Yesterday, a team of 3 doctors and 5 para-medical staff has left for Nepal from Jodhpur.

They would work under senior IAS officer Rajeshwar Singh who was appointed by Chief Minister Vasundhara Raje to look into medical relief measures in Nepal.
