A Surrey Air Ambulance doctor has been opening up about his trip to Nepal.

The country was hit by another earthquake this week.

It has killed dozens of people, and left over 2,000 injured.

Dr Richard Lyon has just come back from the country.

He tells us he was not surprised a second earthquake happened: "It didn't come as a surprise actually.

"Certainly we know that the first 10 days after a major earthquake is a high risk time for another one to happen.

"Certainly when we were there, we were feeling aftershocks on almost an hourly basis."

Dr Lyon adds how the disaster has affected local people: "There was one small girl that had unfortunately been very sadly orphaned as a result of her house collapsing.

"She had suffered from very nasty wounds to her head, which were becoming quite infected

"The problem with the high temperature and humidity is that the smallest cut or graze can very rapidly get infected."

Nepal's Prime Minister is warning that the country has become "overwhelmed" by this second massive earthquake.

It came just 17 days after the devastating 7.8-magnitude tremor killed more than 8,000 and injured almost 20,000.

Sushil Koirala has been visiting the administrative centre of Charikot which has thousands of people crowding its streets looking for help.

He says no-one was prepared for a second quake so big.

Aula Bahadur Ale, the assistant administrator of the district, said there were 36 dead in Charikot and surrounding areas and 106 injured: "It looks like a graveyard here.

"Even those houses that have not been flattened have developed cracks. People are too afraid to go into them. We are still feeling the aftershocks that make people terrified."
