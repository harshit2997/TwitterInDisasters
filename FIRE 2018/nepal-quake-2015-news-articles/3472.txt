As rescue efforts continue in Nepal, Western Massachusetts residents are hoping to send aid to the families in desperate need.

Employees from Spices of Asia market in West Springfield have been following the impact of the devastating earthquake, as it has hit the country that many of their customers call home.

Owner Hash Gogri said one of his employees is from Nepal and has been having a tough time reaching his family members. Gogri knew he needed to help.

"We told him, let's do something about this, and we immediately came up with the idea to ask customers to donate," Gogri said.

Employees are also adding their own donations, hoping to match whatever generous amount customers give.

"If not a big amount, then a small amount, but our hearts are with those people over there and we want to do as much as we can to help," Gogri said.

They plan to send their funds to the Red Cross.

Big Y grocery stores will also be collecting donations at their 60 stores throughout Massachusetts and Connecticut.
