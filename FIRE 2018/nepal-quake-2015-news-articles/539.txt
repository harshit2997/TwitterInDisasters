Apple, Prabal Gurung Spur Brands’ Nepal Earthquake Disaster Relief Efforts
</headline>

Brands are doing their part for Nepal disaster relief in the aftermath of Saturday’s earthquake. While UN agencies including UNICEF have dispatched personnel, supplies and funds to assist in the global emergency outreach to help Nepal, where the death toll is at least 3,000 people, brands are stepping up—and mourning, too.

We've just launched a Person Finder instance to help track missing persons for the #Nepal earthquake, http://t.co/olPoKniVrZ — GoogleCrisisResponse (@GoogleCR) April 25, 2015

Google, which quickly deployed its person finder tool to help track residents and visitors in the area, was stunned to learn that one of its own perished in the tragedy: Dan Fredinburg, an adventure-loving engineer and social entrepreneur who was hiking Mount Everest with two other Googlers. Fredinburg worked on Google’s privacy team for the Google[x] experimental lab, among other roles.

Veteran mountain-climber Fredinburg’s sister Megan posted on his Instagram feed that “he suffered from a major head injury and didn’t make it.” A Crowdrise fundraiser page set up in his memory notes:

“Our friend Dan Fredinburg was climbing Everest on behalf of OrphanGift in support of two Nepali orphanages when the earthquake struck. Please donate to honor his memory and carry on his mission. All funds will help OrphanGift provide urgent aid for the children effected by the disaster and restoring structural damage.”

Facebook’s recently-launched Safety Check is also helping people track down loved ones in Nepal, as CEO Mark Zuckerberg posted on Saturday.

Apple, meanwhile, has been raising funds for the American Red Cross via iTunes and the App Store in suggested increments from $5 to $200, and via the organization’s Apple Watch “Emergency App.” Apple CEO Tim Cook and SVP of marketing Phil Schiller have been promoting the donation channel via their Twitter feeds.

Our thoughts and prayers go out to everyone affected by the tragic earthquake in Nepal. Donate to the relief effort at #iTunes and #AppStore — Tim Cook (@tim_cook) April 26, 2015

Kathmandu-born fashion designer Prabal Gurung has been raising money for relief efforts by the Shikshya Foundation Nepal, where he is a board member and brand ambassador.

Gurung shared on Twitter that the CFDA Foundation has donated $10,000 to his fundraising page, helping the designer raise more than $125,000 so far for his foundation. (Follow his Twitter feed for other noteworthy Nepal relief efforts.)

Thank you @cfda for your $10k donation for Nepal Earthquake Relief Fund.This means so much. DONATE NOW: http://t.co/XCvqBzYuB9 #cfda — Prabal Gurung (@prabalgurung) April 26, 2015

Gap Inc. is matching employee donations and checking on Bangladeshi factory workers:

On the less exemplary side, India’s American Swan clothing brand offended with this SMS message:

Another Indian brand, the e-commerce eyewear site Lenskart, has also found itself in trouble. The online purveyor of sunglasses and eyewear is apologizing for sending out a tasteless mobile marketing pitch by SMS in the wake of the quake that stated (unbelievably):

“Shake it off like this Earthquake: Get any Vincent Chase Sunglasses upto Rs. 3000 for FLAT Rs. 500, by sending invites to 50 friends @ http://www.lenskart.com/refer-sun”

"We are sorry!" Peyush Bansal & Amit Chaudhary, co-founders, Lenskart – Note: http://t.co/2PFCS6eGn3 — Lenskart (@Lenskart_com) April 25, 2015

Monday update: Prabal Gurung told CNN about the progress of his Nepal relief fundraiser, which has seen donations from celebrities including Kim Kardashian and Sarah Jessica Parker —

The Kellogg Company announced it has donated $200,000 to the United Nations World Food Programme to help earthquake victims. Yum! Brands (and its KFC brand) are also promoting the WFC on social media, while Sprint announced it is waiving fees for calls and texts to Nepal, as is T-Mobile. Microsoft is also offering free Skype calls to the nation.
