101 year old man rescued

According to media reports Monday, police in Napal rescued a 101-year-old man from under the rubble of his home on Saturday, one week after an earthquake hit his country, Nepal Police spokesman Kamal Singh Bam told CNN.

local police officer Arun Kumar Singh told AFP news agency.

“He was brought to the district hospital in a helicopter. His condition is stable,” Mr Singh said from Nuwakot district, around 80 kilometres north-west of Kathmandu.

“He has injuries on his left ankle and hand. His family is with him.”

It was an unlikely escape. By his own account, he should have died. But when the humble hut of stacked grey stones collapsed onto Funchu Tamang, who believes himself to be 101 years old, his daughter-in-law quickly pulled him from the wreckage.
