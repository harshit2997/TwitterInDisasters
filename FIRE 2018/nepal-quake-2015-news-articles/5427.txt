Israel issues Nepal travel warning as hikers body returned – J.

Israel’s Foreign Ministry issued a travel warning to Nepal, citing the aftermath of the deadly earthquake that struck last month.

The warning issued May 5, more than a week after the earthquake, notes a shortage of medicine and ability to provide medical care, irregular food supplies and possibly contaminated drinking water in many areas of the country.

Nepal is a favored destination for Israelis following their military service.

Hundreds of Israelis were traveling in the country when the 7.8 magnitude temblor struck on April 25. Some 250 Israelis originally were reported missing. All have been accounted for, including the one casualty, Or Asraf, whose body was retrieved from a remote mountainside in the Langtang area and flown back to Israel for burial.

Asraf, 22, had been traveling with members of his former Israeli army unit, but left for a hike on his own shortly before the quake hit. Asraf, who was injured in Israel’s operation in Gaza last summer, was on a trip to far-flung places that was due to end in July. He volunteered at schools and agricultural villages in Nepal during his time there.

The death toll from the quake climbed to 7,500 as of May 5, with more than 14,500 injured, as a new 4.0 magnitude quake hit the area. — jta
