Vikram: Nepal people don't deserve this tragedy: Vijay Milton

Director Vijay Milton and his team have been shaken by the news of the earthquake in Nepal . The team has just returned from a month-long shooting schedule for the Vikram and Samantha-starrer, 10 Endrathukulla , in Nepal. When Milton spoke to us, the first thing he recalled was the warmth of the Nepalese and the stunning visuals that he has captured of the country, for his film.'We shot for about 15 days in Bhaktapur, which is the worst-affected by the earthquake. More than the place, we miss the people of Bhaktapur. Though we did not interact much as we do not know the language, they were so loving and caring. They gave us the space and cooperated all through the shoot, and somehow, the people of that village became our friends. That place was very different and most of the houses were brick homes. Shooting was very difficult because of the challenging weather conditions. It was raining on most days and we experienced a hail storm as well. As I also double up as the cameraman for this film, I saw a lot of that place through the lens, and I must say, it is one of the most beautiful places I have ever seen. I am deeply hurt to know that such unspoilt beauty has been devastated by earthquake.'He adds, 'We as a team are mourning, now. All of us with contact numbers of those we interacted with when we were there and made friends with, have been trying to call our friends there. But none of them is reachable. We managed to reach one lady, Radhika, who took very good care of us during the shoot. She told us she had hurt herself as she tried to run to safety from the hotel at the time of the quake. She told us, 'Some of us are badly injured and we have been staying in an open ground for the past two days.' After this short chat with her, I couldn't reach her any more. Our hearts go out to them, such warm-hearted people they are; they don't deserve this tragedy.' Milton also told us how they had waited for almost six months to visit Nepal during March-April. 'We had heard that the place would be fantastic around this time, with lot of greenery and some amazing flowers. It was indeed spectacular,' he recalls.
