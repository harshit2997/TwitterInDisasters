Organisers of the International Eisteddfod have sent a heartfelt message to a school dance troupe from Nepal hit by the latest earthquake.

The Rising Culture Group from Bhaktapur had hoped to compete at the event in Llangollen, Denbighshire, in July.

Speaking to BBC Wales, chairman Gethin Davies said they are "terribly sorry" the group are now unable to attend.

Todd Lochhead, who was coordinating their visit, is preparing to join the rescue effort in Nepal on Friday.

At least 65 people died and nearly 2,000 were hurt in Tuesday's 7.3 magnitude quake.

Buildings collapsed

Mr Davies said: "We send our deepest sympathy and our warmest love."

According to Mr Lochhead, half of the buildings in the Kathmandu Valley city of Bhaktapur have collapsed, so families and children from the school have been sleeping outside.

He hopes one or two members of the group can still be brought over, although he acknowledged it would be "a huge ask".

"At the moment, I can't imagine any of the parents allowing their children out of their sight," he added.
