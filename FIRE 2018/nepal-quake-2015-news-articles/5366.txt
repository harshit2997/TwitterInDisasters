KIEV, May 7 (Xinhua) -- An aircraft IL-76 of the Ukrainian Armed Forces, carrying 87 people evacuated from quake-hit Nepal, arrived at the Boryspil International Airport early Thursday, authorities said.

Among the passengers were 76 Ukrainians and 11 citizens from Russia, Poland, Georgia and France, the State Service for Emergencies said in a statement.

According to the Ukrainian Foreign Ministry, a total of 196 Ukrainian citizens were in Nepal when a 7.9-magnitude earthquake hit Nepal on April 25, and 40 of them are still unaccounted for.

The Ukrainian government has allocated around 350,000 U.S. dollars for the emergency evacuation of Ukrainian nationals from Nepal, where more than 7,600 people have been killed in the quake.
