OKLAHOMA CITY – Just days after remembering the devastation and shocking loss that afflicted our community on April 19, 1995, a time of need has arisen elsewhere in the world.

In the ancient and beautiful land of Nepal, thousands of people have lost their lives as a result of this weekend’s devastating earthquake in Nepal. Katmandu’s Chabad Center has become a refuge for Israeli backpackers and others.

Suddenly, Chabad is at the forefront of caring for not only the local Jewish community in crisis but also thousands of tourists suddenly in dire need of emergency provisions.

Despite the danger, Chabad Rabbi Chezki and Chanie Lifshitz are selflessly providing a comforting shoulder, emergency aid and assisting families from abroad who are desperately trying to connect with their loved ones.

They cannot do this alone. They need support. The Chabad Center in Nepal is the only Jewish presence in the mountainous country.

Our dear friends with Chabad here in Oklahoma City stands on the forefront of relief efforts now emerging in the United States.

Your donation through the Chabad Community Center for Jewish Life and Learning in Oklahoma City is tax-deductible and all funds will go directly to assist relief efforts in Nepal. To help, visit the website and follow the prompts.
