49-year-old Renu Fotedar, who hailed from Srinagar was amongst several mountaineers who died in the avalanche after a massive earthquake hit Nepal on Saturday.

Renu had climbed Mt Kilimanjaro in Tanzania last year before embarking on her ambitious plan to conquer the world's highest peak - Mt Everest.

Her cousin Aashish Kaul in Mumbai on Monday spoke about the tragedy that had befallen on the family.

Renu moved out of the Kashmir Valley after the Kashmiri pandit families migrated in the early 1990's. She stayed in Udhampur of Jammu region before shifting to Delhi for her higher studies.

Married to Lokesh Fotedar, a businessman, the family moved to Australia where they got citizenship of that country.

Her 16-year-old son Sahil posted a message to Renu's friends saying that "my mother, Renu Fotedar, set off to climb Mount Everest three weeks ago and had just reached base camp two days ago on April 24...

"On the 26th of April, we were informed that she was found under the avalanche debris. Renu Fotedar had passed away," the message said.

Renu headed for Nepal from Switzerland on April 14 and reached the base camp on April 24.

Her body was located by her husband with the help of a Sherpa in the base camp along with a Japanese woman mountaineer.

"All of us kept trying to know her whereabouts and later in the evening located one of the Sherpas who accompanied her and eventually led us to her body.

"The entire group perished including her campmate--a 50- year-old Japanese lady. Till that time all of us believed she was alive as she was always brave," Kaul said.

Renu had recently moved to Switzerland and was founder of Athena International Academy of Behavioural Sciences and Evolutionary Human skills in Switzerland.

Six helicopters were sent to the avalanche-hit area on Saturday, but only two could operate because of inclement weather.

Saturday's earthquake, measuring 7.9 on the Richter scale, killed over 2,500 people and left 5,850 injured. The temblor had its epicentre in Lamjung district, around 75 km northwest of Kathmandu.

It also triggered a series of avalanches which hit Mount Everest base camp.
