Nepalese Students in Bengaluru Begin Fundraising Drive for Their Quake-Hit Country
</headline>

<text>
Hundreds of Nepalese students in Bengaluru's many higher educational institutions began a fundraising drive today, to encourage people to help their quake-hit country where the number of people killed has exceeded 4000."We are collecting funds for relief. Even if a few people get help, we will feel great," said Bhumika Koirala, a Nepalese student. Students took out a rally through Malleswaram in the city.Many students said that because they cannot go Nepal right now, they will feel a little better if they are able to help. "I have no words to say about this destruction, because all my family and friends, they are in trouble right now. We are sitting here, we can't do anything, it's a very bad thing for us," said Aditi Sharma, a young student from Kathmandu.Other students said that even those who survived are still facing great difficulties because they don't have water, a safe place to stay or food. The bad weather, that is hampering rescue and relief efforts, is also a big cause for concern, they said. "There are heavy storms, rainfall which is leading to the destruction of many buildings and property in Nepal," said Ibras, another Nepalese student.The students were joined on their fundraising drive today by party workers of the state BJP. "A large number of (Nepalese) students are studying in Bangalore in various institutions," said Dr Ashwath Narayan, a BJP lawmaker from Malleswaram. "Probably through them we can reach many mutts, social organisations...So, we can plan well, based on their requirements and inputs. They'll be hosting on various sites their requirements," he explained.R Ashok, former Deputy Chief Minister, said he, too, has contributed, by offering to give away six months' salary to the Nepal government. "Today we are going around Bangalore to collect funds to help the Nepali people who are our brothers and sisters,'' he said.
