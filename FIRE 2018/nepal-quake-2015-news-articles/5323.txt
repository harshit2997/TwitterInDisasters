A Prayer for Nepal, with proceeds to Wind Horse Earthquake Rescue Fund, happens Sunday from 2-6 p.m.

During the event, owner Karma Ugyen will talk to guests about the Tibetan prayer flag, while Laurel Paluck will offer stop-frame animation of the Tree of Katmandu. Nepalese music and tea will be part of the event.

The dinner at 4:30 p.m. will be a Nepalese Thali, which includes momos, lentil dahl, salads, rice and lamb or vegetarian curry.

It's $25 per plate or by donation. Call 705-748-5451 to reserve a table.

All proceeds go to the quake relief fund. For details, visit www.wind-horse.us or donate online at www.gofundme.com/964cb8
