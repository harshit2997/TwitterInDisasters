UNICEF fears for wellbeing of children after 7.9 earthquake in Nepal

Donate: www.unicef.org.nz/Nepal

UNICEF is mobilizing an urgent response to meet the needs of children affected by Saturday's 7.9 earthquake in Kathmandu, Nepal.

With children accounting for roughly half the country's population, UNICEF fears the disaster, which is reported to have already killed hundreds of people, will have a severe impact on children.

UNICEF New Zealand's Executive Director Vivien Maidaborn said, "Our thoughts are with the people of Nepal as they struggle to come to terms with the aftermath of this major disaster.

"New Zealand and Nepal have a long established bond and we know many Kiwis will be wanting to help Nepal in whatever way they can. Every dollar donated will make an enormous difference to children who need urgent help. Please visit: www.unicef.org.nz/Nepal

"We need to keep our promise to Nepal's children to always be there for them - in this emergency and every day."

UNICEF is on the ground, evaluating what needs to be done to immediately respond to the needs of the children, men and women affected.

UNICEF has prepositioned supplies, including water purification tablets, hygiene kits, tarpaulins and nutrition supplies, and is working with government and other partners to meet children’s immediate needs in the areas of water and sanitation, child protection, health and nutrition.

The 7.9 earthquake has destroyed buildings, cellphone networks are down in many areas and power is out.

Rupa Joshi, communication officer with UNICEF in Nepal shared an eyewitness account, "The shake was like nothing I have experienced in my 57 years. It was strong and it shook for a long time. Many old monuments, including famous temples and stupas have come down. Many people fear Kathmandu will have very a high death rate. I feel pain for all the families here. Lives snuffed out in a minute."

Ms Maidaborn added, "Communications continue to be problematic and we don't yet have a full picture of the devastation, but we fear huge loss of life and homes destroyed. UNICEF urgently needs funds in order to reach children as they are always the most vulnerable in emergencies such as this. Please donate what you can at: www.unicef.org.nz/Nepal"
