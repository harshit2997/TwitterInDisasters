BENGALURU:As many as 175 people from the state have returned safe from earthquake-ravaged Nepal.

Confirming this to Express, secretary of Karnataka State Disaster Management Authority Ritesh Kumar Singh said, “In all, around 175 people have been evacuated from Nepal while a few more, around 15-20, are still left (to be brought back).

He said around 200 people have arrived by road at Gorakhpur, taking the number of people who have returned to around 400, and that those left back will be evacuated shortly.

State government officials, including those at Karnataka Bhavan in New Delhi, coordinated with various other agencies involved in rescue and relief operations to ensure the safe return of people from the state.

When asked whether there are more people from the state who could not be contacted, Singh said it was highly unlikely. “Considering that we have been receiving calls from families of those in Nepal and that none of them have reported that their friends/family are still missing, it is highly unlikely that there are more missing people from the state. However, we are checking. Also, the number of calls pertaining to missing complaints have come down considerably and there were hardly any calls on Tuesday,” he said. Officials in the state control room said they received more than 1,200 calls since Saturday.

Rangaswamy, joint resident commissioner of Karnataka Bhavan, told Express that there are around 1,000 Indians still waiting to be evacuated from Nepal.

“However, this number includes people from other states as well. There were around 35 people from Karnataka who landed last night and have been sent home. For now, the Bhavan premises here is empty...One must also take into consideration the number of people who crossed the Indo-Nepal border by road from Gorakhpur and made it to the state through different means,” he said.

However, an official admitted that it is possible that some people from Karnataka are still trapped there. “For instance, let’s say a family of 10 were living in a house when the quake struck, following which the roof collapsed, killing all of them. If they are still buried under the rubble, there is no way to find out till their bodies are extricated and more details are ascertained,” he said.
