NEPAL QUAKE: Mum's relief as son Adam Powell is found - but still stranded
</headline>

A HAMPSHIRE mum has spoken of her relief as her son was found after the huge earthquake which shook Nepal.

Adam Powell and his wife Tracy had been climbing Everest when the 7.9 magnitude quake struck.

Now, Adam's mum Margaret has spoken of her relief after the 45-year-old finally made contact with her today.

Gigantic avalanches tore down the world's highest mountain and hundreds of climbers - including Adam and Tracy, are still stranded.

The couple, who emigrated to Perth, Australia seven years ago, had travelled to Nepal to fulfil a lifelong dream.

Friends and family in Hampshire feared for their safety after they could not get hold of them and reported the pair missing.

The 70-year-old from Lee-on-the-Solent said: “I'm really grateful to my family and friends for all the support I have been given. Everyone has done everything they could by going on missing persons' websites and making phone calls to help find them.

“They are stuck there but they are safe and well. He said they're hoping to get down the mountain as soon as possible.

“It's been a traumatic 48 hours for me, my husband and the rest of my family but it must have been equally terrible for him.

“I'm just relieved he's okay and as soon as he's able to get back to Australia the better.”
