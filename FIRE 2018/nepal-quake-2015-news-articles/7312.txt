GUWAHATI: The 11-member Everest expedition team from Assam, which was present at the base camp along with foreign climbers when the April 25 earthquake jolted Nepal, returned on Wednesday evening.The team planned to scale the world's highest peak on May 16 and 17, but its quest was cut short after the deadly earthquake struck the Himalayan nation. The climbers returned home disheartened but relieved at being safe.Eighteen foreign mountaineers died at the base camp and 50 more were injured.The team left for Nepal on April 3. On April 18, it reached the base camp and the climbers were undergoing training exercises, including mountain acclimatization and getting acquainted with the terrain. On April 25, the team was undergoing training at a spot a short distance away from the base camp when the quake struck."There was snow all around. When we returned to the base camp, the place had changed completely. Some of our equipment was damaged and I lost important belongings," said Pranoy Bordoloi, joint convener of Assam Everest Expedition Committee."We were quite optimistic about our expedition, but disaster struck and we had to abandon our plans. We are thankful to the people who helped us return home," he added.After the quake, the team climbed down to Gorakshep where they stayed for two days. On April 27, they made another plan to scale the peak. However, the sherpas and pollution control officials told them that it was impossible to scale the Everest as the route from the base camp to Camp 1 was closed.The team stayed at the base camp till May 3. It came back to Gorakhshep and then to Syangboche towards Lukla from where the climbers were airlifted by the IAF on May 6.
