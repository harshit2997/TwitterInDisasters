KOTTAYAM: The state government has swung into action and brought back 32 Malayalees safely from the tremor-hit Nepal on Sunday. Though the exact number is not available yet, over 100 Malayalis are reportedly stranded in Nepal.

“The government is trying to bring back all the stranded Malayalis from Nepal. Control rooms have been opened at NoRKA office in Thiruvananthapuram and Kerala House in Delhi,” Minister for Non-Resident Keralites Affairs K C Joseph told mediapersons here on Sunday. “As this is the tourist season in Nepal, many people have gone there as part of package tours. Over 100 Malayalees are reportedly stranded at Nepal. The exact number is not available,”said Joseph.

“Of the two batches of tourists went to Nepal from Kozhikode, one comprising 32 members was brought back to Delhi,” the minister said adding that they are provided with food and accommodation at the Kerala House. He said measures are being taken to get their air tickets revalidated to expedite the return. The other group is coming via Gorakhpur.

On the missing team of medicos from the Kozhikode Medical College, the minister said Vadakara-native Dr Abhin Surya was found at a hospital in Nepal. However, whereabouts of Iritti-native Dr Deepak and Kasargod-native Dr Irshad have not been received yet. “The Chief Minister is monitoring the rescue operations. We are passing on whatever information we are getting to the Union Government,” Joseph added.
