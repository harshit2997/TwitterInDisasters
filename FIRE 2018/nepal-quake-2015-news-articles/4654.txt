China's armed police officers of their traffic rescue operation left the southwestern Tibet Autonomous Region and entered the country for the first time on Sunday to aid earthquake relief.

As the Home Ministry approved the Chinese armed forceâ€™s request to work with the APF, the team will also assist to reopen the blocked Araniko Highway.

The Chinese Embassy had made the request on April 29, according to the letter issued by the Home Ministry. The ministry also instructed the APF to coordinate with the Chinese team.

Chinese media on Sunday said that the operation, approved by the State Council and Central Military Commission, was launched after the urgent request of Nepal.

In the afternoon, around 160 armed police officers and 56 units of engineering machinery entered the country across the Friendship Bridge that links the two countries.

Their first mission is to reopen the road connecting the border pass of Zham and Kathmandu. The China-Nepal Highway, with a total length of 943 km including 829 km in Tibet, was severely damaged in the earthquake on April 25. Workers had cleared the Tibetan section of the highway by Friday afternoon.

According to General Fu Ling of the traffic rescue brigade, around 500 police officers together with 180 units of engineering machinery would be organised into three groups and a reserve team to clear the road. The team also has geologists to assist in the operation. Fu said the officers would observe Nepali laws and regulations, respect local religious belief and customs, and do their best to aid the quake relief works.
