KATHMANDU, Nepal — A top Nepalese police official says at least 876 people are confirmed dead in the wake of the massive earthquake that struck outside Kathmandu.

Deputy Inspector General of Police Komal Singh Bam says that the death toll is expected to rise following Saturday’s quake.

The quake with a preliminary magnitude of 7.8 struck before noon and was most severely felt in the capital as well as the densely populated Kathmandu Valley. A magnitude-6.6 aftershock hit about an hour later, and smaller aftershocks continued to ripple through the region for hours.
