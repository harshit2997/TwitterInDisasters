Nepalese Reverend in Central VA Responds to the Earthquake
</headline>

People in central Virginia are feeling the effects of the earthquake in Nepal.

Advancing Native Missions, an Afton-based agency has been hosting a minister from the Kathmandu area of Nepal.

Reverend Philemon Chhetri describes Saturday's devastating earthquake in his home country of Nepal by acknowledging that it happened without any warning.

Chhetri is in charge of more than 155 churches in and around Nepal's capital city of Kathmandu.

"It is very important and crucial time for me to think about my people in Nepal and try to help them," says Chhetri.

Chhetri is not alone in his concern for those immediately affected by the quake.

â€œOur first response has just been heartbreak to see the images on TV, to see the thousands killed many more thousands that have been injured. And then to know that we have friends there that desperately need our help," says Oliver Asher, CEO of Advancing Native Missions.

Advancing Native Missions has rallied their own disaster relief team, and they are beginning to raise funds to put towards relief efforts.

First order of business in the organization's relief effort is to get the word out about the needs of Nepali people who are now without food or shelter following the earthquake.

Communication to and from Kathmandu is obviously a challenge right now.

Chhetri plans to return home on May 4. He says he does not know yet how many of his congregants have been affected by the earthquake.
