"so far, we have provided Nepal with two rounds of emergency assistance worth 6 billion yuan. The first round focused on the relocation of the affected people and the second round of assistance is to address reconstruction."

Qian made the remarks this afternoon during a joint press conference on China's rescue operation in Nepal.

Alao at the press conference, Assistant Foreign Minister Liu Jianchao says China will negotiate with the Nepalese side over financial support.
