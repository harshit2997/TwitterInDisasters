Yesterday afternoon, on a flight from Istanbul, the six-person group of mountain climbers from Latvia, who were stranded in Nepal following the killer earthquake, finally returned home.

Andris Balodis, one of the trip's organizers, informed LETA that all six "have just arrived, and are fine."

The six were forced to cancel their expedition, but Balodis declared that despite the traumatic experience, none of the six are saying "no" to future adventures. In fact, they are planning another trek this fall.

"The first days after the earthquake, we sure had to think things over," Balodis pointed out.

As reported, the ordeal for the six was not without stress, with one of them posting complaints on "Facebook" about being stranded in Nepal and that the Latvian Foreign Ministry is doing nothing. Despite the ministry's efforts to aid the group, it opted not to continue waiting for an evacuation helicopter, and managed to catch a local flight to Katmandu.
