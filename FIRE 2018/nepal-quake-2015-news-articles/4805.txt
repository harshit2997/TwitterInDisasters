Los Altos physician assists with relief efforts in Nepal

Longtime Los Altos resident Paul Auerbach, M.D., received a phone call the night of April 25 alerting him to the 7.8 magnitude earthquake in Nepal. The next day, the emergency medicine physician from the Stanford University School of Medicine and member of the International Medical Corps was on his way to Kathmandu.

Auerbach, who traveled to Haiti in the aftermath of the 2010 earthquake, wasn’t able to land in Kathmandu immediately, as the airport’s single runway was crowded with planes shipping supplies to the devastated area.

The commercial flight, filled with first responders, including a Japanese search-and-rescue team, and a number of Nepalese residents returning home, was diverted to India and eventually landed in Bangkok. Auerbach finally arrived in Nepal April 26, the following morning California time, according to his wife, Sherrie Auerbach.

In addition to dispatching its chief of emergency medicine, Stanford plans to send more help, Auerbach wrote on his April 28 blog.

“The local medical community has responded aggressively to this situation, and the health professionals have been working around the clock to tend to patients,” he wrote. “The overall community led by volunteers is assessing its capabilities to support shelter, hygiene, provision of safe water and food and integration of its capabilities with those that are coming in relief.”

Sherrie Auerbach told the Town Crier that she’s not really sure where her husband is.

“The only news I have is that he was going over the hill for an assessment, but I don’t know where the hill is,” she said.

The physician has been to Nepal before, including trekking to the Mount Everest Base Camp.

“It was very sad to see the collapse of buildings – indeed large portions of certain neighborhoods – as well as ancient temples and iconic structures,” he writes in his blog.

Auerbach took note of the many residents sheltering in tents, with hail and an intense rainstorm prompting street flooding and foreshadowing the risk of diseases, like cholera, because of the earthquake-damaged infrastructure services. His wife expects his work to include setting up clinics and other medical facilities to help the injured, in addition to working alongside other emergency doctors.

Sherrie Auerbach said Nepal can be chaotic, even without earthquakes.
