William signs Nepal book of condolence ahead of Royal Baby arrival

Prince William has paid his respects to the victims of the Nepal earthquake. The 32-year-old visited the Nepalese Embassy on Friday to sign their book of condolence.

Kensington Palace tweeted an image of the Duke signing the book, writing: "The Duke of Cambridge has signed a book of condolence for victims of the Nepal earthquake."

The Duke wrote: "With my deepest condolences to the people of Nepal and my thoughts and prayers to all those affected."

William is not the only member of the royal family to pay tribute to the victims of the natural disaster. The Queen, Prince Charles and the Duchess of Cornwall have all donated an undisclosed sum of personal money to the Disasters Emergency Committee's appeal, which will be used to help support the work of the DEC's 13-member organisations.

The Queen has a close association with Nepal, and addressed a message of support to the country's president Ram Baran Yadav, releasing it as a statement by Buckingham Palace.

It said that Her Majesty was "shocked to hear of the appalling loss of life and injuries" and that her "thoughts and prayers are with the victims".

Meanwhile Kensington Palace also retweeted a message of support that Prince Harry had sent to the charity MAP Action. The 30-year-old wrote: "I have been deeply saddened to hear of the terrible loss of life and damage caused by the earthquake over the weekend. My thoughts are with all those who have lost loved ones and the many thousands who have been left homeless as a result of this tragedy."

William's visit to the Nepalese embassy comes as the world eagerly awaits the news that his wife the Duchess of Cambridge, née Kate Middleton, has gone into labour.

Royal watchers have been glued to Kensington Palace's official Twitter feed after it was confirmed that updates about the royal baby would come via social media. However some fans joked that the palace's social media team were "teasing" them by posting a "throwback Thursday" picture of William and Kate introducing Prince George for the first time in July 2013.
