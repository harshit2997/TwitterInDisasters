Guwahati: The whereabouts of Gobin Konwar, a cloth merchant from North Lakhimpur district and regarded as the sole person from the state missing in Nepal, have not been traced yet.Konwar was in Nepal's Ilam district, around 600 km from Kathmandu, when the quake struck.Additional DGP Umesh Kumar, who was deputed by the state to oversee the rescue effort in Nepal, on Saturday said no contact could be established with Konwar. Kumar said Ilam was unaffected by the quake and Konwar could be in that district or its neighbouring one that borders West Bengal."His number is unreachable," said Kumar.Meanwhile, the body of Padma Majumdar arrived in the city on Saturday. She was cremated in the presence of her family member and neighbours. The sexagenarian was part of an eight-member team of pilgrims from Hengrabari who left for Nepal on April 23.The additional DGP, who reached Kathmandu on April 28, said he contacted the Indian Embassy there to oversee the rescue of people from Assam. "Arriving in Kathmandu, the 26 pilgrims from Assam went to their hotel. Upon checking in, 15 of them went outside for a cup of tea and the rest stayed back. The quake brought down the hotel. Seven died and Abhijit Barua, who was on the fourth floor, fell into a pond near the hotel," said Kumar.Of the 158 people from Assam who were in Nepal, 128 have returned. Twenty-two are still in Nepal.
