Nepal earthquake: Kiwi engineers off to check quake damage
</headline>

<text>
New Zealand engineers are on the way to Nepal to assess earthquake damage in the capital, Kathmandu.

Foreign Minister Murray McCully said the Nepalese Government had asked for help from Kiwi experts to assess critical public infrastructure such as hospitals.

"Four New Zealand engineers, with considerable experience in earthquake strengthening, have volunteered their time and they are en route to Nepal," Mr McCully said yesterday.

"This group of engineers will be in Kathmandu for a week, and, in addition to undertaking damage assessments, they will also help determine whether a larger contingent of 10 to 12 engineers is required.

"This later deployment would be for three months and would focus on assisting with stabilisation and retro-fitting of damaged buildings."

New Zealand has provided $2 million in financial assistance to Nepal after the April 25 earthquake, which killed more than 8000 people and left thousands more homeless.

The deployment of Kiwi engineers comes after an initial offer to send a search and rescue team was accepted, but then declined at the last minute.

The New Zealand Government had approved the sending of an Urban Search and Rescue (Usar) team to Kathmandu and they were expected to fly out two days after the earthquake.

However, before the team's departure the Nepalese Government said it had enough Usar capability in the country.

Meanwhile, Nepal yesterday denied entry to three British military helicopters because of concerns they could damage buildings when landing. The Chinook helicopters arrived in New Delhi last week.
