Wesleyan raises $3,100 to Nepal

Texas Wesleyan has raised $3,100 for Nepal disaster relief as of Wednesday morning, according to Dean of Students Dennis Hall.

A committee led by Hall organized several fundraisers for a cohesive donation from Wesleyan to the United Methodist Committee on Relief, Hall said.

“The outpouring of support from the Texas Wesleyan community is inspirational,” Hall said.

UMCOR is a non-profit organization dedicated to alleviating human suffering around the globe. UMCOR’s work includes programs and projects in disaster response, health, sustainable agriculture, food security and relief supplies, according to umcor.org.

The fundraisers included specialized t-shirts sales and a candlelight memorial that took place in front of the West Library on April 28. Hall said the fundraising efforts are continuing with t-shirts still being sold.

“It is important to recognize that this natural disaster may impact our Texas Wesleyan family, as many of our students are from Nepal and the surrounding areas,” Hall wrote on the university Facebook page.

The 7.8 magnitude earthquake destroyed several monuments and entire villages and left thousands homeless. More than 8,000 people have been killed in the April 25 earthquake, according to the Washington Post.
