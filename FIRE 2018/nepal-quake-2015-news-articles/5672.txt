The campus held a vigil for the earthquake-ravaged country, just hours after volunteers took a flight there to deliver supplies.

"It's going to be a pretty hostile situation and we know that," said Sunil Acharya, one of those on the flight. "Our goal is to go work at ground zero. That's our goal."

Two men from Omaha who were born in Nepal boarded a plane for their home country Thursday, taking much-needed supplies.

"Medicine supplies, Power Bars," Acharya said.

Nebraskans donated most of the items. While the men's mission will only last two weeks, the ongoing recovery effort will take years.

"Just keep praying for us and do what you can do, like keep collecting things, because this is going to be an ongoing process," Acharya said.

You can donate through the Nebraska Nepalese Society's GoFundMe account: http://www.gofundme.com/Nepaliearthquake.

May 4-6, 15 percent of all sales at Jaipur Indian Restaurant in Rockbrook Village will be donated for relief.

You can also make a $10 donation to the American Red Cross, by texting 'Red Cross' to 90999.
