The Australian Defence Force has ramped up support for the victims of the Nepal earthquake with a second Royal Australian Air Force C-17A strategic airlift aircraft supporting the delivery of aid assistance.

Two C-17As departed RAAF Base Amberley yesterday carrying nearly 15 tonnes of Australian aid including tarpaulins, wool blankets, water purification tablets and more than six tonnes of health supplies.

A RAAF Aero Medical Evacuation team will deploy on each aircraft to assist any injured evacuees if required.

Specialist Defence logistic staff will also assist with the transportation of evacuees on the C-17s. Evacuation flights will continue between Kathmandu and Bangkok until they are no longer required.

Additional specialist Defence personnel will provide support to embassy staff in Kathmandu.

The two aircraft overnighted in Bangkok last night and are planned to fly in to Nepal today (Thursday), once the Australian aircraft has been granted access to Kathmandu International Airport.

More than 4600 people have lost their lives as a result of the 7.9 magnitude earthquake, which occurred on April 25.
