STAMFORD, Conn. -- With $5.5 million worth of medical supplies packaged and ready to go behind him in a Stamford warehouse, U.S. Rep. Jim Himes thanked AmeriCares for its speedy response to the Nepal earthquake disaster and to others.

"AmeriCares is a spectacular organization that has for a long time been not just addressing calamities abroad like Nepal, which has what brought me here today, but working in our communities with things like free clinics to make aid and health and food available for people who need it here," Himes (D-4th District) said in an event at the AmeriCares warehouse in Stamford on Friday morning.

"When AmeriCares really steps up is when you have a situation like the earthquake in Nepal. They have unbelievable logistic abilities," he said. "They can move pallets like these full of medicine and food into very damaged areas in and around Kathmandu."

He spoke to about 50 people gathered in the AmeriCares warehouse at 88 Hamilton Ave.

AmeriCares President and CEO Michael J. Nyenhuis said Himes' visit signals the importance of the organization's work.

"It means a lot to us that [Himes] cares deeply about the people we serve around the world but he also cares about AmeriCares as an important part of his district," Nyenhuis said. "For our staff, having him come, it is just one of those pats on the back that's helpful for us. We do a lot of work behind the scenes every days so having him come and say thank you means a lot."

Friday's shipment is expected to arrived in Nepal early next week, said Garrett Ingoglia, vice president of emergency response at AmeriCares. It will bring the AmeriCares aid committed to the Nepal relief effort to $20 million.

About 1,100 health care facilities were damaged or destroyed by the April 25 earthquake, which left more than 8,600 dead and 19,000 injured. The next step for AmeriCares is to help in the rebuilding of health care facilities, Ingoglia said.
