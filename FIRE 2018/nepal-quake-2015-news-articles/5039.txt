Everest not officially closed to climbers; foreign teams urged to wrap up operations

Katmandu: Mount Everest remains open to climbers, a senior official at Nepal’s tourism department said on Monday, despite avalanches after last month’s devastating earthquake destroyed much of the established route to the summit of the world’s highest peak.

But Nepal, which makes millions of dollars from climbers, has hesitated over whether or not to officially close the mountain, and on Monday was still leaving the decision to individual climbers on whether to press ahead.

Climbers pay $11,000 each to climb Everest, and 357 were registered for this climbing season.

“The government will not officially announce the closure because we have given the permit to climbers,” Tulsi Prasad Gautam of Nepal’s tourism department said.

Meanwhile, Nepali police and local volunteers found the bodies of about 100 trekkers and villagers buried in an avalanche set off by last month’s devastating earthquake and were digging through snow and ice for signs of dozens more missing, officials said on Monday.

The bodies were recovered on Saturday and Sunday at the Langtang village, 60 km(40 miles) north of Katmandu, which is on a trekking route popular with Westerners. The entire village, which includes 55 guesthouses for trekkers, was wiped out by the avalanche, officials said.

“Local volunteers and police personnel are digging through six-feet (deep) snow with shovels looking for more bodies,” said Gautam Rimal, assistant chief district officer in the area where Langtang is located.

The dead include at least seven foreigners but only two had been identified, he said.

It was not clear how many people were in Langtang at the time of the avalanche but other officials said about 120 more people could be buried under the snow.

“We had not been able to reach the area earlier because of rains and cloudy weather,” Uddhav Bhattarai, the district’s senior bureaucrat, said by telephone on Sunday.

The government has asked foreign teams to wrap up search and rescue operations, now that there is no hope of finding people alive in the rubble.

“They can leave. If they are also specialists in clearing the rubble, they can stay,” Rameshwor Dangal, an official at Nepal’s home ministry, told Reuters on Monday.

The chief of India’s National Disaster Response Force (NDRF), which was among the first foreign organizations to arrive after the quake, said it had been asked by the Nepalese government to conclude its search and rescue operation.

“All the search and rescue teams, not the relief (teams) ... have been asked to return,” NDRF Director General O.P. Singh told Indian television. “We will see how best it can be done.”

At least 18 of the deaths were on Mount Everest, where avalanches hit the slopes of the world’s highest peak.

In other parts of the Himalayan nation, three people were pulled alive from the rubble of their home on Sunday, eight days after the earthquake, while several media outlets reported that a 101-year-old man was found alive in the rubble on Saturday.

US military aircraft and personnel arrived in Nepal on Sunday and were due to begin helping ferry relief supplies to stricken areas outside the capital, a US Marines spokeswoman said.

The contingent comprised eight aircraft, including one Huey and two C-130s, and between 100 and 120 personnel, spokeswoman Captain Cassandra Gesecki said.

The deployment is expected to ease the piling up of relief material at Katmandu airport, Nepal’s only major airport.

The United Nations said it was looking at a wider array of options for getting supplies to people in the most remote areas, including transporting provisions on the ground through India.

“We are still having problems getting things to people,” said Orla Fagan, a spokeswoman for the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs. “There are people in very, very remote mountain villages.”

On Sunday, the government restricted the landing of large cargo aircraft at the airport to limit damage to the stressed runway, said a UN official who declined to be named.

The United Nations has said 8 million of Nepal’s 28 million people were affected by the quake, with at least 2 million needing tents, water, food and medicines over the next three months.
