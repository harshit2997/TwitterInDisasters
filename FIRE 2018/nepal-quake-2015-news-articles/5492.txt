BANGKOK, 5 May 2015 – The Ministry of Public Health will send a second medical team to help people affected by the devastating quake in Nepal on Thursday.

Acting Permanent Secretary of Public Health Surachet Sathitniramai said the second team will consist of 40 medical personnel. They will be divided into two groups in order to cover more ground.

The first team is scheduled to return to Thailand this Friday. The two groups will travel to Sipaghat and Pascal to ensure the survivors’ hygiene, their physical health and mental well-being.

They are also expected to help restore the health care system in Nepal with other teams from foreign nations.
