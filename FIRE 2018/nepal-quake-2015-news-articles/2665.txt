The death toll from Saturday's earthquake has grown to more than 4,300.

Those who did survive now face life in crowded tents, no sanitation and the fear of disease. The focus is getting clean water to survivors.

The Boston team said they will likely do their live-saving work outside. Many hospitals in Nepal aren't structurally sound now.
