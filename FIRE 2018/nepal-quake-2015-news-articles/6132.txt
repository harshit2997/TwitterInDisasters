Kiwi tells of Nepalese resilience

A Christchurch man helping out on the ground in Nepal says he's pushing on with relief efforts, despite constant aftershocks putting everyone on edge.

Nathan Durkin, the president of the White Elephant Trust in Christchruch is helping to plan and develop strategies to meet the needs of the Nepalise people.

He admits it's no easy task.

"There's definitely a vibe of 'it's pretty scary' and a pretty strange time, but people are resilient and they're wanting to keep going and keep working for each other."

Meanwhile, the founder of Christchurch's Student Volunteer Army hopes to raise more money for relief efforts in light of Tuesday's earthquake in Nepal.

Sam Johnson arrived back in Christchurch from the quake-ravaged country just days before the 7.3 quake hit.

He's diclosed from what he's observed, the situation's dire.

"It's hard to even imagine what those mountains in Nepal are like, but it's like having villages right throughout our Southern Alps.

"It's a long way from any civilisation and it's very difficult to get any aid in, or them out."

Johnson points out residents can donate via the Student Army.

"The Student Army's still got collection buckets going. If anyone wants to make a sizeable donation just to support one particular school or one particular building, feel free to get in touch directly.

"We've got a number of organisations doing that who would really welcome that support."

Meanwhile Oxfam is distributing seed and animal feed, to help those in Nepal stand on their own two feet as quickly as possible.

Aid worker Kai Tabacek says as well as needing shelter, food and clean water, people need to rebuild their homes and livelihoods.

He adds the majority of people in some of the worst hit areas are farmers.

"They keep food stocks such as rice...[and] seeds in their homes, and that may have been buried along with the rest of their belongings."

Tabacek points out there is a short window before the monsoon season, when farmers need to be thinking about planting their next crop.
