BOISE -- Members of the Nepalese Student Association at Boise State University held a candlelight vigil Tuesday night.

About 100 students, staff and community members gathered on the quad at Boise State to support the 22 Nepalese students currently studying at the university.

A moment of silence was also held for earthquake victims in Nepal.

Ujjwal Roy is the president of the Nepalese Student Association. He's a junior at Boise State and told KTVB the outpouring of love and generosity from the community has been much appreciated.

"This just proves that people in Boise they really care about, if one community member suffers, everyone feels the suffering so this is a great feeling in itself," he said after the vigil.

Supporters lit candles and helped sing the national anthem of Nepal during the event.

Some of the Nepalese students had tears in their eyes while talking about family members back home who are dealing with so much loss.

Meanwhile, staff members at Boise State are working to support the group of Nepalese students studying half a world away.

"It's nice that the community is rallying around them. The students themselves have really banded together and supported one another and it's really neat to see this strong sense of community," said Christy Babcock, International Student Services associate director.

Roy and two other Nepalese Boise State students are planning to travel to Nepal next week to help with relief efforts.

The students have started a YouCaring account to raise money for earthquake recovery.

Tuesday night, the account had raised about $3,000.
