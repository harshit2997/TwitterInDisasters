Officials say a Canadian military plane carrying an advance disaster-assistance team has landed in Kathmandu.

The Canadian Joint Operations Command said on Twitter that 31 Armed Forces members had arrived in the earthquake-hit country.

The Canadian Forces said Tuesday that a C-17 transport plane carrying some personnel and supplies was scheduled to land in Kathmandu on Wednesday local time.

It would also be able to fly up to 100 passengers to New Delhi once it's ready to leave.

A second C-17 has left Canada carrying more equipment and people and is expected to be in Nepal on Thursday.
