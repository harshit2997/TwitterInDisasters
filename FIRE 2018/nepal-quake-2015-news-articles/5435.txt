The chiefs of three major parties—the Nepali Congress (NC), CPN-UML and UCPN (Maoist)—have visited worst quake-hit areas to give message of national unity during a time of national crisis.

Prime Minister and NC President Sushil Koirala, CPN-UML Chairman KP Sharma Oli and UCPN (Maoist) Chairman Pushpa Kamal Dahal visited Rasuwa, Nuwakot and Dhading districts on Wednesday, to take stock of the situation in the aftermath of the Great Earthquake.

The trio visited Rasuwa to assess the situation following an avalanche triggered by the devastating earthquake that wiped out the entire settlement of Langtang village, claiming lives of nearly 300 people.

Before they reached Langtang on a helicopter, the chiefs of the major parties attended a programme organised in Dhunche, the district headquarters of Rasuwa.

Addressing the function, Prime Minister Koirala urged one and all to work together during a time of crisis.

The local administration and security agencies informed Koirala about the death and destruction caused by the April 25 earthquake.

Prime Minister Koirala, after meeting the victims at Dhunche, urged the concerned officials to deliver the relief materials to every village. “No one should be excluded, keep that in mind,” said Koirala whose directions were supported by CPN-UML Chairman Oli and UCPN (M) Chairman Dahal. The top leaders visited Nuwakot before they left for Rasuwa. NC leader Arjun Narsingh KC accompanied the leaders trio during their Nuwakot visit.

During their Dhading visit, Constituent Assembly member Dilman Pakhrin informed the top leaders about the shortage of daily essentials in five VDCs in northern part of Dhading district.

Chief of Army Staff Gaurav Sumsher JB Rana, Nepal Police Chief Upendra Kanta Aryal and Armed Police Force Chief Kosh Raj Onta had accompanied the Prime Minister and the leaders in the visit.
