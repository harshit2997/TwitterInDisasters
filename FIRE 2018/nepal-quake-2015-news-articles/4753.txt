He spoke at a small candelight vigil with the Nepalese community in Auckland last night.

The 7.8 magnitude earthquake on 25 April killed more than 7600 people and devastated the centre of the country.

Mr Brown said Nepal needed the kind of help which Auckland could provide.

"We sent our experts to Christchurch. Our wastewater, stormwater, transport, telecommunications experts, that's what we do good as a city.

"When you look at Nepal, and as you look at the pictures of those towns brought to their knees, we can help in that way."

He joked with a few council workers in the crowd that they may soon be on their way to Kathmandu, Nepal's capital.

Patron of the Non-Resident Nepali Association, Sir Ray Avery, also spoke at the vigil.

He urged people to keep donating money, saying it could take 30 to 40 years for the country to get back on its feet.

Peter Hillary, who was on Mount Everest in Nepal when the quake struck, said homelessness was a particular worry with monsoon season just a month away.

The vigil ended with the Nepalese national anthem and a minute's silence.
