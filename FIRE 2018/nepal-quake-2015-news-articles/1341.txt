MORRISVILLE, N.C.—Relief efforts in Nepal are underway after more than 2,000 people were killed in the worst earthquake there in decades on Saturday.

The unexpected events surrounding Saturday’s 7.8 earthquake in Nepal left hundreds of North Carolinians in a time of tragedy, including Ishwar Devkota.

"That's where I grew up, and where I was born and all of that village is flat right now. My father is 86-years-old, he is outside in the yard living overnight and it is raining,” said Devkota.

Members of the Nepal Center of North Carolina, Inc. joined the Hindu Society of North Carolina for a prayer service Sunday.

"In the Cary/Morrisville area alone, there are about 1,500 Nepalese that call this area home. They had an unspeakable tragedy over the weekend and we are here to show our support,” said Morrisville Mayor Mark Stohlman.

Members of the temple hope prayer can bring peace.

"Only prayer can give peace to everybody and all together, we talk to each other," said Saroj Sharma of the Hindu Society of North Carolina.

While they are nearly 8,000 miles away, this community has kept close with loved ones in need.

"We did not know what to do, we just started calling our people, each other and asking how things are at home, how things are there,” said Nepal Center of NC president Dr. Thakur Karkee.

Members hope their support can help rebuild Nepal.

"This took historical buildings, this took many people, many things as it collapsed and it will take a long time to build a new Nepal,” said Annapurna Deo with the Nepal Center of NC.

While the earthquake broke several buildings and many hearts, Devkota said his village will prevail.

"We are not losers, we will fight it and come over it an try to come out ahead of it,” said Devkota.
