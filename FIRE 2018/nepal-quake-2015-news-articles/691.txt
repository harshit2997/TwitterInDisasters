SINGAPORE - The Singapore Red Cross (SRC) will be contributing $50,000 worth of relief items and emergency supplies to earthquake-hit Nepal, it announced on Sunday.

The SRC is also making an urgent public appeal for donations towards the relief and recovery efforts in Nepal.

The Singapore Government has already contributed S$100,000 toward this appeal as seed money.

Mr Benjamin William, Secretary General of SRC said they were informed by their Red Cross responders on the ground that strong aftershocks continue to be felt, adding risk of further damage to the buildings.

He said that many victims are living in fear and are unable to return to their homes.

Damage to roads and the airport also means that getting relief and aid to these communities is also going to pose a great logistical challenge, added Mr William.

The funds collected will be used toward the affected communities and the people who have lost homes and livelihood.

Members of the public can make donations at Red Cross House, 15 Penang Lane, Singapore 236486, from 9am to 6pm on Mondays to Fridays.

Family members who wish to contact their loved ones in the affected areas can register at http://familylinks.icrc.org/nepal-earthquake or call the Singapore Red Cross hotline at 6664 0501 from Monday (April 27).
