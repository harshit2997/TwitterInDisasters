Craig Potton Raises Money for Nepal Starts



Following the Nepal earthquake on April 25th, New Zealand landscape photographer, Craig Potton, has started a fundraiser based at his Nelson gallery. The catastrophic event, which killed more than 7,000 people and injured more than twice as many was the biggest disaster to strike Nepal since the last major earthquake in 1934.

Nepal is a country that Potton has travelled to on several occasions. His affinity with the majestic landscape, gentle culture and spiritual communities led him to publish two books on the area. In 1995, Potton published Offerings From Nepal, a Montana Book Award finalist. Offerings from Nepal contains over 100 full-colour photographs of the outstanding scenery of the Nepal area, as well as thought provoking photographs of the Nepalese people and their way of life.

Along with writer Lisa Choegyal, in 2008 Potton produced Kathmandu Valley Style, a book celebrating the art and architecture of Nepal’s Kathmandu Valley and honouring the pioneers who made Kathmandu Valley their homes over the past few decades.

As part of his fundraiser, Potton is offering both of these titles (which are now out of print) along with framed photographic prints from the books for hugely reduced prices. All of the proceeds from the sale of these books and photographs will be given to Unicef to help the people of Nepal through this tragedy.

Craig has chosen Unicef as it is an organization he has been involved in for many years. “Of all the aid agencies, along with the Red Cross, Unicef has the broadest reach in Nepal and has proven to be very effective on the ground in this major catastrophe”, he says.

On Thursday, May 28th, Potton will also be holding an evening presentation of his Nepal images. Coinciding with Craig Potton Gallery + Store’s monthly late night, the event will be free entry. However, Potton welcomes attendees to bring along their spare change for the donation bucket, which will be added to the fundraising total.

The plight of the Nepalese is close to Potton’s heart: “Nepal is one of the world’s poorest countries in terms of how much its citizens earn, yet it has given me and so any others the richest of spiritual gifts.”
