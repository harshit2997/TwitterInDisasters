Greater Sudbury's Cody Walter OK after Nepal earthquake
</headline>

<text>
A Greater Sudbury man who hadn't been heard from since a massive earthquake struck Nepal on Saturday is safe, according to his girlfriend.

Cody Walter, from Lively, was hiking with his friend Samuel Caldbick in Langtang Park, about 65 kilometres north of the Nepalese capital of Kathmandu when the quake hit.

Walter's girlfriend Jennifer Ring tweeted Monday night that families have heard from the two men, who were waiting for their rescue chopper.

We got word the Cody Walter and Sam Caldbick are SAFE and waiting for their rescue chopper!! Thank you @carolineheldman for everything!! â€” @Ringer83

The magnitude 7.8 earthquake, which originated outside Kathmandu, was the worst to hit the poor South Asian nation in over 80 years.

The official death toll has soared past 4,000 as of Monday. Well over 1,000 of the victims were in Kathmandu.

There are 462 Canadians registered in Nepal, but registration is voluntary, so the number of people in the country is almost certainly higher.
