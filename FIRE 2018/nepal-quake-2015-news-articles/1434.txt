Pasadena Firefighters Head to Nepal
</headline>

<text>
NBC Los Angeles reports that three firefighters from Pasadena Station No. 32 are using personal days to fly to Nepal and help victims of the magnitude 7.8 earthquake that has already taken over 2,100 lives. The quake also killed and injured people in India, Tibet, and Bangladesh.

The fire captain Tim Okimura, paramedic Matthew Caffey, and engineer David Marquez are part of an emergency response team preparing to leave for Nepal, reports Jane Yamamoto.

No department equipment is being taken. The late actor Paul Walker’s foundation, Reach Out World Wide, which he founded in response to the Haiti earthquake, is providing supplies for the trip. Marquez worked beside Walker in Haiti.

“Being involved in these operations gives each and every one of us a chance to do what we’ve been trained to do,” Marquez told Yamamoto of NBC L.A. This will be his fifth deployment.

According to Marquez, they’ll be headed somewhere outside of Kathmandu, though they don’t know the specific location.

“Our mission is typically to assess areas that have not received any of the initial larger responses and give them care.”
