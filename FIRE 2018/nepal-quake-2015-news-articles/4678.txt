KATHMANDU, May 6, 2015:

Israel has sent a team of five medical clowns to treat people traumatised by tremors in the aftermath of Nepal’s April 25 earthquake, Press Trust of India (PTI) reported.

The Israel embassy said in a press release on Tuesday the team would attempt to ease trauma effects and reduce pain and anxiety among children and adults in communities and hospitals.

“Therapeutic clowning” is used as an integrated component of care for adult and paediatric patients and their families.

Medical clowns also help to lighten the mood of healthcare providers and staff.

Studies have shown that having clowns in the operating room can ease anxiety among young patients.
