PUPILS at Brent Knoll Primary School did their bit to help the ongoing relief effort in Nepal by holding a non-uniform day.

The school decided to raise funds following the devastating earthquake which has claimed the lives of more than 7,500 people.

Pupils heard from a guest speaker during a special assembly who gave them information on the disaster and also the role of Ghurkas in the relief effort.

Chris Clark, a parent, who has close links with the Nepalese after serving as an officer in the Gurkhas for many years.

He remains involved in the Gurkha Welfare Trust, an organisation which undertakes projects across the country that aid the development of key services, such as schools and sanitation.

Mr Clarke explained to the youngsters exactly how the Gurkhas are working hard to help their country recover from the earthquake.

Chris Burman, head teacher, said: “Having Mr Clark explain what Nepal is like and the role of the Gurkhas really helped the children understand the challenges brought about by the earthquake.”

The 7.8-magnitude earthquake has injured more than 14,500More than 4,000 aid workers from around the world have been helping with relief and rescue operations.
