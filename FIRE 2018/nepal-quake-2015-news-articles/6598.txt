The Czech Republic would send another aircraft with health supplies to Nepal, which was hit by another massive earthquake on Tuesday, Czech firefighters' spokeswoman Nicole Zaoralova said.

Zaoralova said the aircraft was to fly back the rescue team that had been helping Nepal for two weeks following the first deadly earthquake on April 25. Further equipment for the health unit would also be sent in the plane.

Zaoralova said despite further tremors and aftershocks, the Czech rescue unit had intensively continued treating the injured, getting ready for a large influx of more wounded people.

She said the rescuers' stay might be prolonged in the area after the second earthquake. The decision was to be made depending on the latest news on the ground in Nepal in the coming hours.

A total of 37 people have been confirmed dead on Tuesday's powerful quake that jolted Nepal, the Home Ministry said in its latest update.

More than 8,000 people have been confirmed dead while another 17,000 were injured in the April 25 quake. Endit
