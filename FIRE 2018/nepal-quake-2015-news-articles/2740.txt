</headline>

<text>
The Indian community today mourned the death of avid mountaineer Renu Fotedar, who became the first Australian killed on Mount Everest in the avalanche triggered by the devastating 7.9-magnitude earthquake in Nepal.Ms Fotedar, 49, who hailed from Srinagar and was settled in Australia, was killed on Saturday during her maiden trip to the world's highest peak of 8,848 meters."We are deeply shocked and saddened by the untimely death of our dearest friend, Renu Fotedar. She was on her maiden trip to Mt Everest and was at the base camp when the disaster took place," a statement, issued by her friends in Melbourne said. She had recently visited Melbourne in February this year along with her husband and son.A lover of adventure sports, Ms Fotedar had climbed Mt Kilimanjaro in Tanzania last year before embarking on her ambitious plan to conquer Everest."She had briefly informed us about her next adventure to Himalayas during her short stay this time. She was living in Geneva but used to do regular visits to Melbourne," the statement said, adding that she was "extremely friendly" and "passionate" about nature and life."Today, we have not only lost a good friend but a beautiful loving sister. We are pained by her going away so early. We will miss her deeply but she will continue to live in our hearts forever," it said.Ms Fotedar had moved to Switzerland three years ago and was a holistic and transpersonal councillor.A small private prayer ceremony is also being organised in Melbourne at a Hindu temple by her friends and community members to pay their respect and tribute.There are over 60 Kashmiri Pandit families living in the south-east state Victoria.Meanwhile, Australia has announced to send additional humanitarian experts to Kathmandu, including a small number of medical personnel to assist health coordination in the wake of the earthquake.A disaster expert from Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade (DFAT) will also join the United Nations Disaster Assessment and Coordination team.This is in addition to the USD 5 million in humanitarian assistance Australia is already providing."I have also agreed to allocate USD 1 million of Australia's USD 5 million package of assistance to the World Health Organisation to procure urgently needed medical supplies," Foreign Minister Julie Bishop said today.Further humanitarian relief supplies will be delivered by the Automatic Direction Finder (ADF) aircraft on its arrival in Nepal, including much-needed water purification and hygiene kits, shelter and blankets.
