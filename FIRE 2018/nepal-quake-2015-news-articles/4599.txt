Aid, health and water are fundamental issues in Nepal

(Vatican Radio) Customs bottlenecks in Nepal are being blamed for a hold up in the distribution of urgently needed aid. Exacerbating the situation, is also a shortage of supply trucks and drivers, because after the earthquake many immediately returned to their villages to help their families. At the same time, the Nepalese Government is still appealing for aid in the form of tents, tarpaulins and basic food supplies of grains, salt and sugar. The Finance Minister Ram Sharam Mahat told reporters "We have received things like tuna fish mayonnaise. What good are those things to us?"

Health Care continues to be the biggest problem. Paul Garwood of the UNâ€™s World Health Organisation, who is on the ground in Kathmandu, told UN Radio a timely response to potential health crises is of the essence, especially as the water supply is concerned, stating that "It is crucial to start early in the prevention of communicable diseases such as diarrhea ... diarrhea is endemic already in Nepal ... we have to be on guard, on the watch from the very start."
