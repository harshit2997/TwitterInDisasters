With relatives in Nepal, Mumbaikars, Nepalis cling on to hope

As casualties of the Nepal earthquake continue to rise, many in India whose loved ones are in Nepal hope the resultant tremors won't give way to another massive quake.

"As of now, we have only managed to speak to them once," said Rupesh Kap, whose uncle, family and friends have been in Kathmandu for the past four days. "All they could convey was that they were fine. We have not been able to contact them since."

Oshiwara resident Ukesh Gahal, who is Nepali, is worried about his family in Kathmandu. "There have been 19 mild tremors after the earthquake. All people have been asked is to not enter their houses post 7pm," he said.

The picture of his family car buried under the rubble and family members sitting outside their home has made Gahal anxious. "I could not talk to them over the phone, so I contacted them on social media. They said the weather was bad, and there could be rains," he added.

Master Thapa, whose family is in Pokhara, is relieved to hear that his immediate family is safe. "We have some relatives in the hilly regions too. We will only know what has happened there by tomorrow. Some of us are trying to make arrangements to go there," said Thapa.

Relief and rehabilitation minister Eknath Khadse said, "As per the information available with our control room, around 184 people have been traced and are safe. Approximately 100 are yet to be contacted as their phones are switched off."
