SACRAMENTO-

The Nepalese community in Sacramento is still coming to grips with the massive loss of life and widespread devastation caused by that 7.8 magnitude quake in Nepal.

"All my family is back home. I'm the only one so all my siblings are back home," said Suman Shrestha.

A group of five men from Nepal told FOX40 they are all still deeply connected to their home country.

They say many of their loved ones are now living on the streets and living in fear.

"Just a feeling of helplessness I wish there was something I could do. Not only to my family but to other people over there, but there's nothing we can do to help over there than I suppose just pray," Shrestha said.

Now they're sending more than prayers to Nepal.

They're also planning to send relief money. A group gathered Sunday to organize fundraising efforts.

"Every minute and every penny counts towards the life there," Jit Baral said.

The Red Cross says fundraising is the best way anyone can help the people in Nepal, money is what they need the most.

"I believe that right now the international efforts are focusing on providing potable water to the region and determining the scope of the devastation in the surrounding areas itself," said Robin Friedman, regional disaster program manager for the Red Cross.

The Red Cross has a team of volunteers in Nepal, assessing the damage and the needs of the people.

It's the largest quake to strike Nepal since the 1930s.

"People don't know what is the size of loss?" Jit Baral said.

As the shock sinks in, the hope is whatever money the community raises will help survivors get their lives back together.

Anyone who wants to help can contribute to the Sacramento Nepalese community's "Go Fund Me" page, or through the Red Cross.
