Grateful to India for its humanitarian assistance in Nepal, Yemen: Sherman
</headline>

United States Under Secretary of State for Political Affairs Wendy Sherman, currently on an official visit in the country, on Wednesday said that her nation is grateful to India for the humanitarian assistance it has provided over the last few weeks in Nepal and Yemen.

"We are very grateful for the leadership shown by India. It is the result of the capacity, capability and competence that India has. We all want to leave Nepal in charge. But I know they couldn't proceed forward in this disaster and you need help of neighbours. We are also grateful for the leadership India has shown in helping to get so many people out of Yemen during the recent crisis in that country, including evacuating some American citizens," Sherman said, while while addressing an event in the national capital.

"We are very grateful for what India has done in its humanitarian assistance and are incredibly grateful for everything India does in peacekeeping around the world. We see India growing in ability to not only deal with its very real needs, to continue to grow and to deal with needs of its people but to play a leadership role regionally and internationally," she added.

Sherman's remarks came a day after US Ambassador Richard Rahul Verma had said that India has demonstrated its global leadership through its rescue and relief efforts in earthquake-hit Nepal.

Saturday's earthquake, which measured 7.9 on the Richter scale, resulted in the deaths of over 5,200 people and was one of the worst calamities suffered by Nepal in over 80 years.

India has evacuated 170 foreign nationals hailing from 15 countries from Nepal, which include 71 Spaniards, 33 Polish, 20 Czech, 10 US and eight German nationals.

This followed the evacuation of over 5,600 people from crisis-hit Yemen earlier this month.
