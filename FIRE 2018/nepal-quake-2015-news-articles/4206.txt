NAGPUR: The aftershocks of the disastrous Nepal quake might have faded away, but hopes of finding missing persons have surely not dimmed. Taking desperate measures and risking his life and limb, Ashok Meshram has set out on a journey to Nepal in search of his missing parents.TOI has been repeatedly reporting how 59-year-old Balchandra Meshram and his 60-year-old wife Antibai Meshram remain untraceable since the first quake hit Nepal. The couple had gone to Nepal on a pilgrimage trip and had last spoken to their son Ashok when they were in Varanasi, as they were about to leave for Pashupatinath temple in Kathmandu.They were supposed to reach on last Wednesday but their son never heard of their safe arrival. After hearing about the quake, Ashok had repeatedly tried to find his parents but all in vain."I can't just sit at home and keep waiting to hear from them. I made several phone calls to the district helpline as well as Maharashtra Sadan office in New Delhi. But they were not able to trace my parents. It is high time now and I have to myself go and find them," Ashok told TOI.Ashok, who is going alone, reached Gorakhpur on Thursday and is expected to reach Nepal in a day or two. "I am going to take a bus from Gorakhpur and hope to find the roads open. I will approach the Indian Embassy in Nepal and persuade them to start a rescue operation for my parents," he added.The officials of Maharashtra Sadan in the capital said that they are trying to find the whereabouts of the Meshram couple but they don't have any concrete information to support the search operation. They also tried to dissuade Ashok from going to Nepal, citing the risks. "A rescue team is already there trying to trace missing people. Travelling to Nepal in such a critical situation is not advisable at all," they said.When pressed for reasons behind the failed attempts in finding the Meshram couple, the officials said that no substantial prior information is available. "In the case of rest of the missing people, they were carrying mobile phones. Even if they were switched off, we could trace them as we had the phone number. The biggest challenge in this case is that the couple was not even carrying a phone. Moreover, they did not contact anybody after reaching Nepal, so their last whereabouts is also not known. We have already informed the Indian Embassy in Nepal," they added.
