KUNMING, April 27 (Xinhua) -- A 55-strong team affiliated to the People's Liberation Army (PLA) left for Nepal on Monday morning to help with the rescue operation following Saturday's 7.9-magnitude earthquake.

The team, taking a PLA Air Force plane, departed from Kunming, capital of southwest China's Yunnan Province. Another team of 45 soldiers will leave for Nepal on Tuesday.

The 100 soldiers are taking with them four sniffer dogs, five recovery vehicles and rescue equipment including life detectors and entry tools.

They have participated in many earthquake rescue missions, including the quakes in Wenchuan and Lushan in Sichuan Province and Ludian in Yunnan Province in recent years.

The team will conduct rescue, medical aid and psychological counseling after arriving in Kathmandu, Nepal's capital.

The earthquake struck Nepal at 2:11 p.m. Beijing time on Saturday, followed by a second 7.0-magnitude quake at 2:45 p.m.
