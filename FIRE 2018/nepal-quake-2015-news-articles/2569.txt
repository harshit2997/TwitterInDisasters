KATHMANDU, April 28 (Xinhua) -- Thousands of homeless people left by Saturday's massive earthquake braced for heavy wind and rains in central Kathmandu on Tuesday while relief goods appear meager in front of the huge mass.

The Tudikhel square, used for military parade and national celebrations, has been turned into a huge temporary shelter for thousands of quake victims.

Soldiers, who were posted there to help the people living in makeshift tents, said they were preparing food for at least 7,000 people.

The food is mostly instant noodle and water provided by the government and relief agencies. All the tents were in poor conditions and accommodating too many people inside.

Nepalese Prime Minister Sushil Koirala admitted on Monday that rescue, relief and search operations were not effective enough.

Up to date, 4,355 people were confirmed dead and 8,065 others injured, said a Home Ministry spokesman. In Kathmandu alone, 1,039 were killed while the death toll stood at 243 and 158 respectively in nearby towns of Bhaktapur and Lalitpur.

More than dozen countries, including China, India, Pakistan, the United States, Bangladesh, Singapore, South Korea and Japan, have been sending medical staff, medicines and other relief materials to Nepal.
