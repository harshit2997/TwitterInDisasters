Death toll in Nepal climbs to 3, 351 after Saturday's strong quake, and 6,833 people were injured, said the country's Home Affairs Ministry on Monday.[Special coverage]

Sindhupalchowk, a nearby district to capital Kathmandu, reported 875 deaths, the highest number in one district, said Home Affairs Ministry spokesman Laxmi Dhakal.

Central Nepal is the most affected part of Nepal by Saturday's earthquake.

The 7.9-magnitude quake jolted central, western, mid-western and far-western parts of Nepal, which was followed by at least 15 strong aftershocks, with the last one of 6.7 magnitude occurred on Sunday afternoon.

The quake has also caused property damages worth billions of U. S. dollar in the country.
