More than 2,400 people confirmed dead in 7.8-magnitude earthquake that has devastated the Himalayan nation

I am going to give you links on this post updating you on the Nepal Earthquake, I will do a later post with other stories because I think the efforts in Nepal deserve our singular attention.

Starting with relief programs:

HuffPo has an article here: Aid Agencies Rally To Help Victims Of Nepal‚Äôs Earthquake

From The Independent: Nepal earthquake: How you can help victims of the Kathmandu disaster ‚Äì World ‚Äì News ‚Äì The Independent

And a suggestion from a reader reelcarina: Sad Coincidence: Tragedy in Nepal on Richter Scale Day | stepabout

Accordingly, Nepal‚Äôs government has declared a state of emergency, asking the international community for help. We ARE the international community! So how can we help? Of course, I can‚Äôt just sit here on my sunny balcony in the ‚Äòhappiest country in the world‚Äô (Switzerland was recently found to be that by UNO) and simply do nothing. However, I can‚Äôt drive out to the airport, catch the next plane to Kathmandu and help the population there myself. So, the possibility that remains is donating. I‚Äôm a student, so I don‚Äôt really have many financial means, but to those affected people in Nepal, even 40 or 50 Swiss Francs will be of great help! If you, dear readers, donate as well, it‚Äôs gonna be even better! As for today, my blog‚Äôs got 43 followers (Thank you so much for that, by the way!). If every one of you donates 25 Francs/Euros or whatever other currency, we‚Äôll have contributed over 1000 Euros already! Now imagine, if other bloggers join in, our lovely internet community will unravel its full strength and actually make a difference in Nepal üôÇ

Pooling money together does add up‚Ä¶

Nepal hospitals overflowing, rural towns cut off, aid groups say ‚Äì The Times of India

HONG KONG: Aid groups and governments worldwide intensified efforts Sunday to help earthquake-hit Nepal, but blocked roads, downed power lines and overcrowded hospitals posed formidable challenges in an already poor country. As the death toll in the Himalayan nation surpassed 2,300, the US together with European and Asian nations sent emergency crews to reinforce those scrambling to find survivors in the devastated capital Kathmandu and in cut-off rural areas. ‚ÄúTragically, more bodies are being pulled from collapsed buildings every hour,‚Äù the Australian Red Cross said in a statement. ‚ÄúCommunication is down in many areas. Widespread destruction, rubble and landslides are preventing access to provide aid in many villages.‚Äù

‚ñ∂ Massive Mount Everest Avalanche Caught on Camera ‚Äì YouTube

Posted Apr 25th‚Ä¶.

Published on Apr 25, 2015 Nepal Earthquake Triggers Everest Avalanche, 18 Killed at Base Camp At least 13 people were killed on Everest on Saturday as a massive avalanche ‚Äì triggered by an earthquake near the Nepalese capital Kathmandu ‚Äì swept through base camp. The avalanche trapped other climbers higher on the mountain as those in base camp ran for their lives to escape falling ice and rock. Videos from Everest south-side base camp showed flattened tents and blocks of rock scattered around a site dusted deep in snow. The avalanche appeared to have swept through the mid section of the strung-out base camp.

This is the same video as this: ‚ñ∂ 5/3/09 ‚Äì Mt. Everest Avalanche caught on tape ‚Äì YouTube Uploaded on May 6, 2009 In a series of Skype video chats, Miles O‚ÄôBrien has been talking with Astronaut Scott Parazynski, who is at Mt. Everest prepping for a summit bid. While at Everest Base Camp, Scott and his partner Keith Cowing captured an avalanche on tape.

This next link is interesting, about how poverty will affect the aid relief.

Devastating Earthquake in Nepal: Humanitarian Relief and Tackling Poverty | Winnie Byanyima

Yesterday a terrible earthquake shook Nepal near the capital, Katmandu. Oxfam teams are on ground in Nepal with more staff and relief supplies flying in. I‚Äôd like to share this post which was shared with us in response, by Shaheen Chughtai, Oxfam‚Äôs Deputy Head of Humanitarian Policy and Campaigns. Kathmandu was ever a disaster-in-waiting. The densely populated capital of one of the world‚Äôs poorest countries clings to the slopes of the seismically unstable Himalayas. The city was near-leveled and 8,500 killed in its last great earthquake 81 years before. It had history. On Saturday, the long-feared calamity struck.

And these articles explains why the earthquake happened:

Ancient Collision Made Nepal Earthquake Inevitable ‚Äì NYTimes.com

More than 25 million years ago, India, once a separate island on a quickly sliding piece of the Earth‚Äôs crust, crashed into Asia. The two land masses are still colliding, pushed together at a speed of 1.5 to 2 inches a year. The forces have pushed up the highest mountains in the world, in the Himalayas, and have set off devastating earthquakes. Experts had warned of the danger to the people of Katmandu for decades. The death toll in Nepal on Saturday was practically inevitable given the tectonics, the local geology that made the shaking worse and the lax construction of buildings that could not withstand the shaking.
