New Delhi: Congress vice-president Rahul Gandhi on Friday visited the Nepal Embassy in Delhi days after a strong earthquake devastated the neighbouring country.

Rahul condoled the earthquake victims and wrote a message in the visitors' diary at the embassy.

“Over the last week the world has watched in horror as the true scale of the tragedy in Nepal unfolded before us. Some wounds will never heal, but as Nepal faces the hard task of rebuilding each broken life and broken buildings, the people of India stand with you in strength and solidarity. In the years to come, we will see a stronger, more prosperous, even beautiful Nepal whose ingenerable spirit will rise above present despair and inspire the world,” Rahul wrote.

He also met with Nepal's Ambassador to India Deep Kumar Upadhyay.

After his meeting, Rahul said, "I wanted to come (here) and express my support for people of Nepal. I have already been co-coordinating some help, but reassured the ambassador that if they need any help they should let us know."

Upadhyay, after Rahul's visit, said, "Congress has offered its help. Someone from their party will come to discuss this."

The death toll in Nepal from last weekend's earthquake has risen to 6,204, the Himalayan country's National Emergency Operations Centre said in its latest update today.

Rescuers from over 20 countries have been taking part in the search for survivors in the rubble-strewn capital Kathmandu as well as far-flung rural areas near the epicentre.
