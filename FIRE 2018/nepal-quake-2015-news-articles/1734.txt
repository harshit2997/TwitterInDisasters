Born in India, Melbourne mother of two Renu Fotedar was killed in the deadly avalanche triggered on Mount Everest by the magnitude-7.9 Nepal earthquake, the ABC has confirmed.

The 49-year-old was last seen at the Everest base camp, and since the earthquake , friends and family had taken to social media in a desperate attempt to find her.

Trekking company Dreamers Destination confirmed to the ABC that Ms Fotedar had been killed and the company was trying to return her body to Kathmandu.

The Department of Foreign Affairs has confirmed that Renu Fotedar, was among thousands killed in the devastating earthquake that hit Nepal on Saturday.

On Monday night the foreign affairs minister, Julie Bishop, said she feared there would be more Australian victims.

More than 4,000 people are believed to have been killed but Bishop said she expected the final count to be “well in excess” of this.

Fotedar was a holistic and trans-personal counsellor. Her website noted that she was to be on a 59-day Everest expedition. She had been living in Switzerland for three years.
