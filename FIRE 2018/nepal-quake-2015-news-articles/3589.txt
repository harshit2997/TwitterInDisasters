Students from Nepal who are studying in Salem have proposed to organise a blood donation camp and collect 2,000 units of blood to be sent to their country that was hit by the recent earthquake.

Rahul Kharel and Pukar Singh Chhetri, students of a private catering college, met District Collector K. Maharabushanam and explained about their proposal to conduct a blood donation camp. They sought his assistance for safe transportation of blood to Nepal. The Collector, who assured all help, directed them to Deputy Director of Health Services K. Jegadeesh Kumar.

Sources said that blood needs to be transported safely and the only viable mode now was via flight. Hence, all the modalities have to be worked out for conducting the camp and sending the collected blood, they added.

The students said that there are more that 150 students from Nepal studying in various colleges in the district. They said that their association, Handsome Hotelier Community, would collect funds and relief materials and lend a helping hand to their countrymen.

The students said that after their examinations, they would leave for their country to involve in rehabilitation work.
