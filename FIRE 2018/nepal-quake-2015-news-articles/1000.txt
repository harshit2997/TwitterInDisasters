A Google executive was among the hundreds who died as a result of a 7.8-magnitude earthquake that struck Nepal today.

Dan Fredinburg, an employee working on privacy at Google in Mountain View, was in Nepal with three other Google employees hiking Mount Everest when the earthquake hit, Google Privacy Director Lawrence You said in a statement.

An avalanche struck the base camp during the earthquake and its aftershocks, resulting in injuries for two others climbing Everest with Fredinburg, according to the mountaineering company, Jagged Globe.

The three other Google employees who were with Fredinburg at the time are safe and You said the company is working to get them home quickly:

“Our thoughts are with the people of Nepal, and with Dan’s family and friends during this terrible time.”

The earthquake struck Nepal around noon local time, with the epicenter in the Lamjung district of Nepal, according to officials at the United Nations. The government of Nepal is reporting 700 to 1,000 people dead, though the death toll is expected to increase, according to a United Nations report.

Google has launched a “person finder” for Nepal and is committing $1 million to the response, You said.
