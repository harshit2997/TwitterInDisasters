Nepal earthquake: Hamilton's Ross Prince describes bleak recovery work
</headline>

<text>
Hamilton's Ross Prince has joined the recovery efforts in Nepal while "stranded" in the earthquake-ravaged country.

"It just tears you apart," Prince told NBC's Miguel Almaguer of the grim brick-by-brick recovery effort.

Prince, 62, was in Nepal for a trekking vacation when the devastating earthquake hit. On Tuesday, he was digging through debris with his hands.

"We have to do something to help," Prince said.

He was also critical of the Canadian consulate's handling of the situation. "They've done nothing for us," he said, adding he's been put up by the Americans since the Saturday quake.
