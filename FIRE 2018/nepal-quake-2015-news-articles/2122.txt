Nepalese groups in Hong Kong, charities gear up to help quake victims

Aid groups in the city are appealing for relief funds and supplies for victims in quake-devastated Nepal.

One Nepalese group in Hong Kong will today ship the first batch of supplies it has purchased - 1,500 blankets and 1,000 flashlights.

More supplies including tents, medicine and water purification tablets will be sent on Thursday to help the survivors, the Non Resident Nepali Association (NRNA) said yesterday.

The association is appealing for donations to be dropped off at the Nepalese consulate in Tsim Sha Tsui.

NRNA chairman Durga Gurung said most of its members had their families in Hong Kong, but they still wanted to do something to help their compatriots.

"Very few have family members in Nepal, but we would still like to help," he said, adding that he would meet other Nepalese groups in Hong Kong to discuss what they could offer.

A hikers' group, Hong Kong Hiking Meetup, is organising 25 walks in the city to raise funds for quake victims.

Relief groups in the city yesterday estimated some 30,000 people were living in makeshift shelters in 16 government camps, while the livelihoods of up to 2.8 million people had been affected.

Oxfam Hong Kong said yesterday it planned to allocate HK$2 million to support disaster relief work.

"Telephone lines are down and electricity and water supplies have been damaged ... People need immediate access to adequate safe water, sanitation facilities and food assistance," it said.

Unicef said it had raised more than HK$900,000 in the city so far. More than 120 tonnes of medical supplies were ready to be flown to government camps in the Kathmandu Valley.

The two groups will also build sanitation facilities in Tudikhel, about 100km west of Kathmandu, serving 1,500 to 2,000 people.

The Hong Kong Red Cross earlier said it had contributed HK$500,000 for immediate aid work.

World Vision Hong Kong said more than 200 staff were in Nepal ready to join the relief effort, and it had contributed HK$1.56 million to help survivors.
