GETTY The Ukip leader appeared to back increasing the UK aid budget for Nepal

But the Ukip leader was adamant that he did not want taxpayer money going to the “wrong places”. The UK Government's humanitarian response package for the Nepal earthquake now stands at £22.8 million, following a £5.3 million contribution to the United Nations' emergency appeal.

We've offered just a few million pounds to Nepal. I have no objections to doubling or trebling that Nigel Farage

Doubling the payout would bring the total sum to £45.6 million, while trebling it would see £68.4 million handed to the devastated nation. Mr Farage told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: "When you think that our foreign aid budget is roughly a billion a month. "We've offered just a few million pounds to Nepal. I have no objections to doubling or trebling that. "I have no objections to helping with disaster relief but I have a problem with foreign aid that frankly isn't working, is going to the wrong places, and does not command public support."

PA UK aid has so far exceeded £20 million

Mr Farage insisted his party’s manifesto commitment to cut the foreign aid budget from its current level of 0.7 per cent of national income would not affect Britain’s ability to help with disaster relief. The comments follow news that British rescuers have been instrumental in the search and rescue effort in Nepal.
