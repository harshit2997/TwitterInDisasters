Obama in Portland — President Barack Obama plans to make a stop in Oregon next week to raise money for the Democratic National Committee. Democratic Party of Oregon Executive Director Brad Martin said the president is due in downtown Portland on May 7. It was not clear whether the president will make any public appearances. Obama was most recently in Oregon on July 25, 2012, when he held a private fundraiser at the Oregon Convention Center.

Eugene-area women safe in Nepal — Two 21-year-old friends from their days at Thurston High School in Springfield have reported in from their hiking trip to Nepal and are safe. Family members told KEZI-TV of Eugene that Amber Brazil got through briefly on an emergency line to say that she and Alicia Scroggins are trying to make their way to a spot that vehicles can reach. The two were reported hiking in Nepal’s Langtang National Park when a magnitude 7.8 quake hit Saturday.

Gay conversion therapy — People who say they used to be gay but are now straight are asking an Oregon Senate panel to say no to a bill barring health professionals from trying to change a child’s sexual orientation through therapy. The measure has passed the House. Supporters of the bill say the therapy should be illegal because it can lead to anxiety, depression and destructive behavior in children. But critics say the bill takes away parental choice and infringes on their First Amendment rights. People who said they had gone through the therapy told the Senate Committee on Human Services and Early Childhood on Wednesday they wanted to change their feelings of homosexuality, and the therapy helped.
