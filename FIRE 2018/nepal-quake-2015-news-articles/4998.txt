ANKARA, May 4 (KUNA) ­­ Medical teams from the Istanbul ­based International Doctors Association (IDA) have rushed to Nepal to offer healthcare services to survivors of the devastating quake which rocked the impoverished Asian country recently.

AID member Dr. Nedim Uzun told the official Anadolu news agency that the Turkish teams have examined over 500,000 earthquake survivors in the city of Bhaktapur, one of the hard­hit areas in Nepal. Over 200 people were killed and more than 2,000 were wounded in Bhaktapur following the earthquake, he said.

AID doctors have provided more than 30,000 chlorine removers and masks to people to help them clean water supplies and had taken the temperatures of about 40,000 people and examined more than 500,000.

The 7.8 ­magnitude quake wreaked a trail of death and destruction in the country, reducing much of the capital Kathmandu to rubble and triggering a deadly avalanche on Mount Everest.

In the worst­hit districts of Gorkha and Sindhupalchowk, almost 90 percent of the mostly stone and mud homes have been destroyed, the United Nations said in its latest situation report.

The death toll from the disaster has hit 7,250, according to the Emergency Operations Centre, with more than 14,000 injured. (end) rs.ibi
