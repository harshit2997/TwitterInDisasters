The Dutch Urban Search and Rescue team in Nepal once again searched a number of areas on Wednesday and only found deceased victims. The team also handed the overall coordination to the United Nations.

On Wednesday four Dutch USAR teams searched appointed locations in the southeastern part o Kathmandu, including Patan, Sankhel, Banepa, Bhaktapur and Thimi. Here the teams only found deceased victims, including in an area where reports indicated a survivor was trapped. One of the rescue teams also provided medical care to wounded people in the village of Maligaon.

The team members who left on Tuesday to explore toward the outer regions of Kathmandu, near the epicenter of the earthquake, have returned. They visited the mountainous area and returned with no new deployment location.

Thus far the Dutch USAR teams have searched dozens of locations. The teams are also helping local colleagues in the are of recovering bodies, reviewing architectural structures and reclaiming roads.
