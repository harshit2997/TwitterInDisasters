BRUSSELS, April 28 (Xinhua) -- The Belgian humanitarian mission that left Brussels Sunday for Nepal to help the thousands of victims of the earthquake has left New Delhi for Kathmandu after a delay on Tuesday afternoon.

The Belgian team B-FAST that was to leave New Delhi to Kathmandu lost its landing slot for Nepal, the team leader of the Belgian relief mission, Major Gilles du Bois d'Aische, said.

But eventually the Belgian Airbus carrying 43 Belgian volunteers received permission to take off, according to Belgian public broadcaster RTBF.

The Belgian flight was grounded at New Delhi airport next to a dozen Russian, Spanish and Dutch aircraft filled with humanitarian supplies. It was feared that the Belgian mission would have to return to Brussels.

The offer of help is much greater than the capacity of Kathmandu airport can facilitate, with aircraft circling the airport waiting to land.

Some 90 people are waiting in Kathmandu to be repatriated to Belgium.
