Guwahati: Thirty-six people who were stuck in quake-ravaged Kathmandu reached the city on Monday.State home secretary L S Changsan said, so far, seven people from Assam have been declared dead in Nepal and their bodies will be flown to Delhi on Monday night.Chief executive officer of Assam State Disaster Management Authority (ASDMA) P K Tiwari said 40 people from the state have been flown to Delhi from Kathmandu over the last few days. Of them, 30 were flown to Guwahati on Monday with the help of government agencies, while six arrived here on their own.As the survivors emerged from the Lokpriya Gopinath Bordoloi International Airport, their faces bore signs of relief and exhaustion. "It's my second birth. I thank the Almighty for saving my life. I have seen disaster in front of me," said a survivor from the city.Changsan said, "We had information about 120 people from Assam being stuck in Kathmandu. Forty of them have been brought back to Delhi. Also, nine people are undergoing treatment in various hospitals in Kathmandu. We are in touch with the ministry of external affairs and ministry of home affairs so that more people can be rescued."She added that ADGP Umesh Kumar has left for Kathmandu to liaise with the Indian embassy and Nepal officials and trace the missing.Tiwari said the option of bringing back stranded people by road is also being explored. "We have asked the authorities in Kokrajhar to make arrangements to bring back survivors by road," he said.A medical team, comprising surgical, orthopedic and trauma management specialists, along with Army officers from the Tezpur-based Gajraj Corps, left for Kathmandu on Sunday. The medical team was airlifted by a C-17 aircraft that arrived from the Palam airbase.Regarding the city's disaster mitigation plans, Tiwari said officials of the PWD will be trained on testing the fitness of concrete buildings."We are in the process of doing GIS mapping of critical utility services like hospitals so that these services become accessible in case of a disaster. At the same time, we are mapping available open space in the city so that people can take shelter there in such situations," Tiwari said. Changsan said all district administrations have been asked to be ready with contingency plans at the police station-level to deal with such a situation.
