Redlands man seeks community support to assist Nepal victims

REDLANDS >> Jim Bacca, local Sunrise/RSRX Rotary Club president and Inland Empire regional Ambassador for ShelterBox USA, is asking for community support to bring more ShelterBoxes to those most affected by the 7.8 magnitude quake that struck Nepal on April 25, killing at least 5,000 people.

Founded in 2001 by Tom Henderson of Cornwall, England, the ShelterBox concept began as an idea for a Rotary service club project in his hometown. Fifteen years later, ShelterBox has organizations in 19 countries and has assisted with 240 worldwide disasters in more than 90 countries.

Three years ago Bacca was honored by President Barack Obama for his work with this project.

ShelterBox remains the single largest Rotary project in the world with local and international club donations providing a third of the funds needed to maintain the program every year.

“Multiple deployments have occurred in the United States too, including Hurricanes Sandy and Katrina as well as the Mississippi River floods,” Bacca said. “To date, more than 1 million people worldwide have received free emergency aid from ShelterBox.”

Each ShelterBox typically includes a family size tent, thermal blankets, groundsheets, water storage and purification equipment, cooking utensils, a solar lamp, basic tools, repair materials and a children’s activity pack.

One ShelterBox costs approximately $1,000 but often includes customized equipment based on the area of need. The cost also covers transportation and hand delivery of each Box to people who need it most; typically women, children and the elderly.

Bacca said the United Nations estimates 8 million people have been affected. The number represents a fourth of the country’s population. More specifically, 1.4 million people are in immediate need of emergency food and shelter. An overwhelmed Nepalese government needs all the help they can get.

Bacca is requesting local community support in the form of donations to ShelterBox USA.

“Two ShelterBox teams are already on the ground in Nepal, working with the Red Cross and other governmental and non-governmental entities assessing the best use of our type of aid. Pre-positioned equipment is currently en route to the disaster area, but their needs are staggering. As is usually the case, the aid available is always less than the need,” he said.
