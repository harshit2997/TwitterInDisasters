Bangladesh foreign ministry, however, said there had been no reports of any of its nationals being injured in the deadly quake.



Ambassador Mashfee Binte Shams told bdnews24.com that the main tourist attractions in the capital Kathmandu, Thamel and Pokhara were the worst hit, but they were not getting “much information” about damage and casualties.



“We’re working and in close touch with local authorities. We have opened a help desk,” she said, urging all to contact the desk if necessary.



She said Bangladeshis mostly travel Nepal as a tourist destination. “There are roughly 100 families (Bangladeshi) living here. But they all are safe”.



“So far, we don’t have information on casualties,” she said. The ambassador said anyone can contact in her own number +9779851039352.



First Secretary Khan Md Moinul Hossen can be contacted on +9779808184014, while First Secretary Shamima Choudhury can be contacted on +9779808765071 for any support, according to the foreign ministry.

The earthquake came as a massive blow to one of the world's poorest countries struggling to overcome the legacy of a 10-year Maoist insurrection.



Nepal’s Information Minister Minendra Rijal has already appealed for international help.



"We need support from the various international agencies which are more knowledgeable and equipped to handle the kind of emergency we face now,” he was quoted as saying by BBC.



In Bangladesh, a woman has died in a northern district during evacuation. Many more are said to be injured.



In Dhaka, residents of high-rise buildings were seen running down in panic as apartments swung. Two buildings were reported to develop cracks and tilt at the capital Dhaka’s Banani and Banghsal.



Initial reports say many buildings collapsed in India's Assam and Bihar states and also in the Darjeeling hill region and foothills around it.
