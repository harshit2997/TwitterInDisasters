Rescuers save 101-year-old man from wreckage in Nepal
</headline>

A rescue team has saved a 101-year-old man who was buried alive after last week's devastating earthquake in Nepal.

The official death toll from the quake is more than 7,000, but Nepal's government said Sunday the toll is likely to climb "much higher," AFP reports. But in a bit of good news, 101-year-old Funchu Tamang wasn't one of the casualties.

Rescuers found Tamang buried in the collapsed remains of his home in Nuwakot's Kimtang village on Saturday. He was taken to a local hospital, where his condition was pronounced stable. Tamang suffered only minor injuries, according to AFP.

Officials also rescued three female survivors from rubble in the district of Sindhupalchowk on Sunday, but it is unclear how long they were buried. â€”Meghan DeMaria
