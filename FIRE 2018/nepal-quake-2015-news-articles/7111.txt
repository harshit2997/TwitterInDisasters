VANCOUVER (NEWS1130) – Things are still not back to normal in Nepal, three weeks after a powerful earthquake killed more than 8,000 people.

The owner of a cafe in Vancouver has been hearing from his family in that country.

Pradeep Sharma with Cafe Kathmandu says people remain afraid because of the aftershocks. Older houses continue to crumble and cracks are forming in newer ones.

He says his father works for the government and can’t go back to his usual duties because he’s sent on recovery missions instead.

“It’s a painful situation. Everyone is in a devastating situtation now. So although we’ve been trying to help as much as possible, that’s not enough, I think,” says Sharma.

“It’s going to take a lot of time to rebuild. People have lost their lives. People are sick. The people who are the real victims… its going to take a long time to get over those things.”

This week, his restaurant will be handing over more than $10,000 to two charities, including the Canadian Red Cross, thanks to fundraising events.
