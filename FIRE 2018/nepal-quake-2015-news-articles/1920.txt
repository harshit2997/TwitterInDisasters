A magnitude 7.8 earthquake slammed into Nepal near the capital of Kathmandu Saturday, leaving the country devastated and destroying many of its sacred temples and buildings.



The following day, a magnitude 6.7 aftershock jolted Nepal while they were still digging through the rubble. Nepalis are digging through the rubble for survivors of the quakes, which killed more than 3,200 people.

The New Hampshire chapter of the Non-Resident Nepali Association (NRNA) organized a meeting of several groups on Sunday to discuss ways to send aid and organize rescue and relief efforts in Nepal.

Ishwori Bhatta of NRNA says the humanitarian need is great.

”All the sectors are destroyed. All the houses are destroyed. All the schools are destroyed. All the children said they have no place to sit right now. All the people are out in the ground. They are in tents,” Bhatta said.

The earthquake also caused numerous landslides and an avalanche on Mount Everest, which buried part of the base camp. At least 18 people died there and 61 were injured.

The Bhutanese Community of New Hampshire hosted the meeting at their office in Concord, New Hampshire, Sunday. Group leaders are hoping to find volunteers to travel to Nepal and aid the relief effort.

The American Red Cross was also at the meeting. Adam Burritt said the Red Cross is trying to help U.S. families communicate with loved ones in Nepal.

“We want to make sure that people if they want to reach out, they do so through their local communities. But they can also do so through the American Red Cross. They can contact our office and our international service volunteers can kind of reach out with them and help them go through the process of connecting with those volunteers in a secure manner,” Burritt said.

Meeting organizers said they also plan to set up fundraising efforts in New Hampshire.

Granite Staters wishing to contribute to the relief effort in Nepal can donate to the American Red Cross, CARE or other humanitarian organizations.
