Shrewsbury shop supports Nepal earthquake appeal
</headline>

<text>
A Shrewsbury retailer with close links to Nepal has decided to devote part of her shop to raising money for the earthquake relief fund.

Sarah Jane Luck, who owns handicraft and gift shop Sarasvati in The Parade, in St Mary’s Place, has sold products made in Nepal since she opened a decade ago.

She is now so concerned about the livelihoods of her friends, suppliers and others affected by the devastating earthquakes that she has set up a special retail area.

“I have a long tradition of selling fairly traded goods such as incense from Nepal which support people running small businesses,” said Sarah Jane.

“We were very worried about the earthquakes and wanted to do more to help and our customers have also expressed great concern and solidarity for the Nepali people.

“So we have created a special area where items such as hand-made bowls are being sold, with 100% of profits from these products going to the Seeing Hands charity.

“This is an organisation which we have always supported and had a collection box for. It was set up to train blind Nepali people as masseurs so that they can have a career and it is now trying to get aid to rural areas where no help has yet reached.”

Sarasvati became involved with Seeing Hands through Shrewsbury massage therapist Paul Martin who travels to Nepal to train people there.

“Nepal is such a beautiful and spiritually rich country and we want to do everything we can to help rebuild it,” Sarah Jane added.
