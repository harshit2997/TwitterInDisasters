John Ball is one of six firefighters from the Essex Fire and Rescue service who travelled to Kathmandu as part of the UK’s International Search and Rescue team.

Mr Ball, who grew up in Southend and now lives in Bentley near Ipswich, took along his trusted family dog, Darcy, a 10-year-old border collie.

Nepal is Darcy’s second overseas deployment - she and Mr Ball worked together on a rescue mission in Sumatra, Indonesia after the 2009 earthquake.

“You get a very special bond with your dog, you spend so much time with them. You need that bond because you need the trust - the dogs need to believe in you because they go into dangerous places,” he said.

“You get on with the job but you always reflect on it afterwards. You do feel humbled by the people who have lost everything but get up and carry on.”

The other Essex firefighters are Timothy Hersey, Gregory Kench and Nicholas Manning from Colchester, Mark Sladden from Southend, and Martin Stoker from Clacton.
