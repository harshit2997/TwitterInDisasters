no indian rescue team till nepal asks for help

New Delhi: India will not send any rescue team to Nepal to assist the local administration unless the neighbouring country seeks help in the wake of today's earthquake.

“Government will wait for a call from Nepal before sending any rescue team to Nepal,” a source privy to the deliberations at the highest level of the government said. The move bears significance as after about 10 days of the April 25 earthquake, Nepal had abruptly asked all foreign rescue teams, including India's National Disaster Response Force, to return home.

The government, however, has kept the NDRF and the Indian Air Force in full alert and on standby to respond to any emergency call from Nepal.

“We are aware that the call may come to the Indian Embassy in Kathmandu or from Nepal Embassy in New Delhi. We are prepared,” the source said.

Within hours of the April 25 earthquake, Indian rescue teams had landed in Kathmandu and deployed for rescue operations immediately.

The issue of sending recuse team figured at a high-level meeting chaired by Union Home Secretary L C Goyal but no decision was taken.

The meeting was attended by representatives of Ministries of External Affairs, Defence, National Disaster Management Authority, IMD besides others.
