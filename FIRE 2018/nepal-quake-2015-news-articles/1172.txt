Turkish search and rescue teams are heading to Nepal after a 7.8-magnitude earthquake struck the country on Saturday, leaving more than 1,300 people dead.

The Turkish Prime Ministry Disaster and Emergency Management (AFAD) said in a statement that it is sending a team of at least 40 search and rescue experts to Nepal.

The Turkish Health Ministry, the Turkish Red Crescent, Team GEA Search and Rescue and the IHH Humanitarian Relief Foundation are also sending search and rescue teams, in coordination with AFAD.

The Turkish Red Crescent said it will initially send 1,000 blankets and 320 food boxes.

Another non-governmental search and rescue association, AKUT, said it has prepared a team of 40 search and rescue experts. AKUT said that the first team of 15 people has already headed to the affected areas.

The Nepali government had requested international assistance in response to the disaster. The earthquake struck 80 kilometers northwest of the capital Kathmandu, according to the U.S. Geological Survey, but the tremors were felt as far away as New Delhi, Dhaka and Pakistanâ€™s Punjab region.
