Where does your money go when you donate to Nepal disaster relief?
</headline>

Millions of dollars are flowing into Nepal to help with the aftermath of the catastrophic earthquake, but in the digital age, international aid organizations must compete with crowdfunders for your donations.

According to United Nations, more than $22 million has been pledged across the globe to aid Nepal — a far cry from the estimated $415 million needed to help the country recover.

More than a quarter of the estimated need is earmarked for food security, as the earthquake has damaged not only crops, but the roads and runways used to transport food.

But who should you give money to?

Large aid organizations like the Red Cross, UNICEF and the Humanitarian Coalition have traditionally been the collectors and distributors of aid when a natural disaster strikes.

“Canadians always want to know that the largest possible [amount] is going to programs, not overhead, said Humanitarian Coalition spokesperson MJ Proulx.

But at a time when anything from an album release to a funeral can be crowdfunded, it’s easy for small groups or even individuals to become players in the foreign aid game.

On GoFundMe, a crowdfunding website for charities, 244 online campaigns have helped raise more than $1 million for Nepal. The website will donate its 5 per cent fee on all Nepal campaigns to AmeriCares, a spokesperson for GoFundMe said. While most of the campaigns seem to be in earnest, there is no guarantee that money donated will go where it says it will go.

But on its website, GoFundMe said that it cannot keep track of every campaign’s claims and verify their authenticity.

“Only donate to people you personally know & trust,” the website says.

“The line of funding is not clear enough,” said Ruby Dagher, a PhD candidate at Carleton University who researches international aid. “One should not only worry about it landing in the wrong hands, but one should also worry about it actually being dispersed.”

When a natural disaster strikes, the UN’s Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) tracks contributions from governments and international aid organizations like the Red Cross so that it can organize the flow of money into the region.

This is vital, Dagher said, because it means that aid will go to the areas most in need. The UN works with experienced organizations that have people already on the ground who can help deliver the aid, and have a track record of success.

“They have a lot of transparency but they also have to report on results,” Dagher said.

Small organizations and individuals don’t go through OCHA, which means that money may be going to a project that is overfunded while another area is desperately in need.

But it’s not just about money

“It’s laudable that people want to help, and I completely understand that, but the problem then is — is it the appropriate help?” she says. “Or does it cause more bottlenecks on the tarmac.”

Aid can be blocked when there aren’t enough people on the ground to deliver the supplies, or when a natural disaster has damaged airports or bridges, making it difficult to actually deliver the goods.

During the Haiti earthquake, a small organization based out of the United States sent in yoga mats. But instead of providing a bed for people sleeping outside, Dagher said, it took food out of people’s mouths.

“You have a lot of people sending things and really all they do is take up space,” she said. “They actually could cause more damage, more harm than good.”

When the Philippines typhoon hit, Dagher said, a Canadian organization sent high heels to boost women’s confidence following the disaster.

“People were starving and they were very thirsty,” she said.

Even when everything is done right, Dagher said some aid money often goes unspent, because by the time supplies can be delivered to the scene, the region’s needs have shifted.

Getting aid in the right hands

Dagher said Canadians should look for organizations that have people already on the ground in Nepal, have disaster relief experience and are co-ordinated by OCHA, like the Red Cross, UNICEF, Humanitarian Coalition, World Vision and others. She also said to make sure that these aid groups work with the local government, so the region’s political stability isn’t jeopardized.

Stephane Michaud, the chief operations officer for the Canadian Red Cross, said most of the money donated to the Canadian organization goes directly to the Nepal Red Cross.

“We follow the money from A to Z,” he said.
