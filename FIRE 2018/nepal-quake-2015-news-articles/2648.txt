<text>
The number of people killed by a 7.8-magnitude earthquake that struck Nepal over the weekend has risen to more than 4,400 and several vigils have been planned here in Connecticut to provide local residents with a chance to remember and pray for those victims.

TUESDAY

The Branford, Conn. chapter of the Society of Nepalese in America will be holding a candlelight vigil at the Branford Town Hall from 7:30 to 8:30 p.m. The town hall is located at 1019 Main St. in Branford. The chapter is also raising money to support the relief efforts. Donations can be made by following this link: http://www.sonabranford.org/help-nepal.

Trinity College in Hartford will be holding a candlelight vigil at 8:30 p.m. in the college chapel. Attendees will be able to purchase tea lights, which will be arranged in the aisle of the chapel to spell "Pray for Nepal." All proceeds from the sale of the candles will be donated to the American Red Cross for Nepal Earthquake Relief. Binod Giri, a Trinity senior from Nepal, will speak at the event.

WEDNESDAY

UConn's Nepali Student Organization will hold a vigil on Fairfield Way, outside the Student Union, at 7 p.m. Any donations collected at the vigil will be given to Nepal's Red Cross.

SATURDAY

Fairfield University will hold a candlelight vigil at 7 p.m. in front of the Egan Chapel.
