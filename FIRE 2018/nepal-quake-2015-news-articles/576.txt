The Non-Resident Nepali Association (NRNA) in Oman is looking to raise and send RO5,000 as aid to Nepal by Tuesday. This amount will be used to provide aid to those rendered homeless and supply medicines.

The fundraising is first in NRNA’s three-part action plan which took shape during the body’s meeting with Nepalese Embassy officials on Sunday.

“The first stage will involve around 20 people from NRNA and other members of the Nepalese community in raising RO5,000 (approximately 1.3mn Nepali rupees),” D B Chettri, president, NRNA said. The second step of the relief plan, spread over a month, will involve requesting Nepali expats to contribute a day’s earning towards quake relief.

Chettri said, “This is a serious situation and I request every Nepali across the world to assist us. There are around 20,000 Nepalis in Oman and we shall ask everyone to contribute at least a day’s salary.”

In the third stage, NRNA plans to approach social organisations and clubs like the Indian, Bangladesh and Pakistani social clubs for assistance, Chettri said. Bharat Regmi, chargé d’affaires, Nepalese Embassy in Muscat said, “This is a time of national grief and we as Nepalis living outside Oman will be with our countrymen, and I personally appeal to every Nepali to be with us. Foreigners who wish to contribute can approach the embassy.”
