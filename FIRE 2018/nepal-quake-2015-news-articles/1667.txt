New Delhi :

Parliament today expressed solidarity with quake-hit Nepal as government spoke about the massive efforts launched by India by which over 2500 of its nationals besides others have been rescued and free visas are being offered to stranded foreigners to come.

Members of Lok Sabha also decided to donate a month’s salary for the relief work in Nepal.

Both Lok Sabha and Rajya Sabha condoled the loss of lives in Nepal as well as in India due to the earthquake of 7.9 magnitude that struck on Saturday last.

In Lok Sabha, as soon as the House met for the day, Speaker Sumitra Mahajan expressed grief over death of people in Nepal and India due to the earthquake. The House also stood in silence briefly as a mark of respect for the departed.

In Rajya Sabha, when the House met for the day, Chairman Hamid Ansari made a reference to more than 2,600 people killed and hundreds injured in the earthquake.

Members praised the government, including Prime Minister Narendra Modi, for the prompt action to help Nepal.

Leader of Congress in Lok Sabha Mallikarjun Kharge said it is a matter of pride that India is standing by its neighbour in this hour of crisis and emphasised that all parties should stand together as one person cannot provide all the help.

Both Houses saw impromptu debates on the earthquake, that was epicentred in Nepal but also hit northern parts of India, and India’s preparedness to deal with such natural calamities.

Responding to the debate in Lok Sabha, Home Minister Rajnath Singh said it was a “very big tragedy” and India stands by Nepal and those affected in India in this hour of crisis.

He said the toll in India has reached 72 with 56 deaths reported in Bihar, 12 in UP, three in West Bengal and one in Rajasthan.

Giving details of India’s mammoth operation in Nepal, the Home Minister said over 2500 Indians had been evacuated from Nepal and rescue and relief exercise was continuing.
