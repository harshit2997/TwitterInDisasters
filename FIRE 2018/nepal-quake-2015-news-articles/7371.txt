Wreckage of Missing San Diego-Based Marine Helicopter Found...

Posted on by BenLurkin

The wreckage of a U.S. Marine helicopter that went missing with six U.S. Marines and two Nepali service members on board has been found, U.S. Defense officials confirmed Friday.

It is unlikely there are any survivors at this time, said U.S. Marine Lt. Gen. John Wissler, commanding general on the ground in Nepal, and said he was unable to confirm the report from the Nepalese government, that three bodies had been discovered.

Three bodies were discovered in the burned wreckage of the helicopter, which was delivering aid to earthquake survivors, Nepalese Defense Secretary Ishwori Paudyal said.

Wissler said that due to the harsh conditions of the region, he was calling off the search for the evening. Wissler said the deaths would not affect the U.S. Marine mission to the Nepalese region to assist with aid following a series of deadly earthquakes.

The American chopper was spotted in the Gorthali area, at an altitude of 11,200 feet (3,400 meters), said Nepalese Brig. Gen. Binoj Basnet. Its discovery follows intensive searches from the air and on foot, amid treacherous terrain.

The U.S. Joint Task Force confirmed the wreckage, 8 miles north of Charikot, was that of the missing UH-1Y Huey helicopter.

I've seen conflicting reports on the type of A/C. Is it a Huey or a Blackhawk? Not that it really matters, but if they get that wrong, then what else are they screwing up? In my opinion, it took a little long to find it. May God rest their souls. What is it about these brave men (and women) that they go into these places and help their fellow man? Why, they must be Americans...'cause I sure as hell don't see any Russians or French or...others rushing to help. It's like they say, when the rest of the world dials 911, the damned phone rings in America. I guess that's as it should be.

It is a Huey, UH-1Y. The Marines don’t have Blackhawks - UH-60

It’s a Huey. The Marine Corps ordered a fleet of upgraded Hueys and Cobras with four blade rotors, uprated engines, and other modern goodies. I assume the Marines have stuck with the Huey and Cobra for footprint considerations onboard LHDs.

“I assume the Marines have stuck with the Huey and Cobra for footprint considerations onboard LHDs.” That and the Cobra is a better aircraft than the Apache. It’s not as maintenance intensive as the army bird,it packs the same punch, and it is crewed by Marines!

The Bell products take less maintenance, are lower cost, and require fewer personnel to support. The Yankee has surprising capability when compared to the 60. There is also considerable sharing of parts between the Yankee and the Zulu.

Flying a helo over 10,000 feet altitude and the controls get really mushy. That, coupled with the reduced power available and crazy mountain winds/turbulence, it is easy to get into a “gotcha” situation. Semper Fi, Marines.
