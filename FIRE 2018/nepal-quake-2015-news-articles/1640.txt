Countries around the world are rushing to confirm the whereabouts of their nationals in Nepal as the death toll from the earthquake in the South Asian country is rising.



British daily The Guardian said China confirmed the safety of some 680 Chinese tourists in Nepal and sent a chartered plane to help them return home.



Japanâ€™s Jiji Press said the Japanese government set up a contact office to confirm the whereabouts of some eleven-hundred Japanese nationals in Nepal.



India, which borders Nepal, evacuated some 800 of its nationals. Britain, France, Australia and New Zealand are also trying to contact their citizens in the quake-hit country.



BBC said the whereabouts of tens of thousands of Tibetan refugees illegally residing in Nepal have yet to be determined.



The report quoted the Dolma Development Fund, a nongovernmental organizations that cares for Tibetan tribes in Nepal, as saying that it has no idea how many the refugees have survived. The fund added that there are no rescue missions operating in the isolated villages where Tibetan refugees reside.



Meanwhile, the Korean Alpine Federation confirmed that no damage has been reported to South Korean expeditions in the Himalayas.



The federation said it was informed by six South Korean expedition teams in Everest, Lhotse and Annapurna mountains that they moved to a safe area and no one was injured.



As of Monday afternoon, the government has confirmed that three South Koreans were hurt from the massive quake, including an employee of a construction company and a couple in their 50s who were touring Nepal.
