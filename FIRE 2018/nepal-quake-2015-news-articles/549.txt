Beijing, April 26

China on Sunday announced a 20 million yuan (USD 3.3 million) humanitarian aid to Nepal to deal with the massive earthquake that has killed over 2,350 people thus far.

The aid, including supplies of tents, blankets and generators, will be delivered to Nepal by chartered planes, the Ministry of Commerce said.

China will offer further support according to Nepal's demands, it said. A massive 7.9-magnitude quake shook Nepal on Saturday killing more than 2,000 people in the country.

A 62-member China International Search and Rescue Team (CISAR) arrived in Nepal's capital Kathmandu on Saturday and started quake-relief works.

China also deployed several chartered flights to evacuate over 600 of its tourists stranded in Nepal.

International rescue teams, including from India, have touched down as Nepal declared a state of emergency in the wake of the disaster, the worst in over 80 years of the country's recorded history. â€” PTI
