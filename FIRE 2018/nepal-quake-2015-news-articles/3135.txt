MUMBAI: Bringing in his 64th birthday on Monday, two days after he witnessed the devastating aftermath of the Nepal earthquake, had a special significance for Kalyan resident Akshay Gajre. Recounting the anxious five hours that he and his wife spent till the Indian armed forces rescued them, Gajre said he was only too thankful to be alive.Gajre and his wife, Bharati (58), had gone to Nepal sightseeing with a tour organizer. There were 26 others in the group. "We were to fly out of Kathmandu on Saturday and were leaving the hotel for the airport when the tremors were first felt around 11.45am. There were many elderly people and all were nervous. Old structures were collapsing. Even RCC structures, like our hotel, started to develop cracks. Our group was shepherded into an open ground, where we took shelter for a few hours. But whenever we tried to head back to the bus (for the airport), there were fresh tremors, and we would be forced to run back to the ground," Garje told TOI.Around 4.30pm, the group finally reached the airport. "There were large crowds waiting to be rescued. The elderly were given priority. "Of the four aircraft that arrived, two filled up quickly. We were escorted into the third," Garje said. The couple reached here on Sunday.
