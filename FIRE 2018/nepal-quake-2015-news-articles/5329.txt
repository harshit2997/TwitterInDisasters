Jung Woo-sung, honorary advocate for the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), has donated money to help victims of the devastating Nepal earthquake.

Jung, who met refugees during his mission with UNHCR to Nepal in November, sent 50 million won ($46,000) to victims of the April 26 quake, UNHCR Korea said on Friday.

After he was appointed as UNHCR Korea's honorary advocate in May 2014, Jung visited Nepal's eastern Damak and capital Kathmandu to meet refugees from Bhutan, Somalia, Pakistan and Tibet.

UNHCR is fully operational on the ground in Nepal, with more than 110 international and national staffers working in Kathmandu and Damak. The agency responded immediately to the quake by delivering plastic sheets, solar lamps and other basic supplies to more than 40,000 victims.

With Nepal's rainy season just six weeks away, people are in urgent need of plastic sheeting and tarpaulins to create shelter. The government of Nepal estimates at least 200,000 houses have been destroyed and another 190,000 badly damaged, leaving some 2.8 million people in the open and in need of help and protection.
