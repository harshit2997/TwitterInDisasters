PETALING JAYA: A non-governmental organisation is seeking public donations of medicines for the Drikung Phende Clinic in Kathmandu, Nepal, operated by the Drikung Kagyu Rinchen Ling Monastery for relief efforts following a devastating earthquake there.

"The monastery has opened the free clinic for all the victims after the earthquake. The Drikung Phende Clinic will collect these medicines and distribute them to all neighbouring villages where people are now living in tents in very unsanitary conditions," said Rainbow of Life Forces (ROLF) founder Adelyn Lim in a press release Wednesday.

She added that the villagers urgently require medications such as paracetamol and antibiotics, and that ROLF would be setting up drop-off points in the Klang Valley from 10.30am to 6pm on Sunday (May 10).
