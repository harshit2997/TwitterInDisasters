DES MOINES, Iowa -- Emergency relief agencies are already on the ground in Nepal but a metro doctor is planning a way Iowans can help from home.

Mercy physician Dr. Richard Deming is organizing a fundraiser for relief agencies. Deming said once he heard the news of the massive earthquake, he was tempted to fly to Kathmandu to help treat victims. Instead, he said the country needs more financial assistance.

“We really don't need a whole bunch of people to fly over there right now and be more mouths to feed and people who consume the resources," Deming said. "We really need to help support the agencies that are working with the government and the Nepali people.”

The 7.8 magnitude earthquake killed more than 2,400 people in the Nepal's capital, Kathmandu on Saturday. Severe aftershock have injured nearly 6,000 others.

Also, as founder of “Above and Beyond Cancer,” a non–profit organization offering 'healing' trips for those who have suffered from cancer, Deming has traveled to Nepal several times. The organization took its first trip to Nepal in 2011.

He is teaming up with the Iowa Nepalese Association to plan the fundraiser with the intention to help Iowans learn about more about Nepalese people so they how exactly how their efforts will help the country.

“We're going to bring together some of the Nepali people that live here in Des Moines to help tell the story of Nepal," Deming said. "I think that's how we can help the most."

A date has not been set for the event but will be sometime this week. Information will be provided by the Iowa Nepalese Association website: http://www.iowanepaleseassociation.org/ and Facebook page: https://www.facebook.com/IowaNepal?fref=ts
