Nepalese students hold memorial service to pray for homeland

May 1, 2015 Ryukyu Shimpo

On April 30, the International Center Of Language & Culture Institute of Japanese Language held memorial services at its campus in Naha City. Seventy-one people, including international students from Nepal and school staff attended and laid flowers. Two memorial services were held – one in the morning and one in the afternoon. In the evening, a candlelight ceremony was held at the request of the students from Nepal.

Twenty-four-year-old K.C.Basant, spoke on behalf of the international students, “The earthquake killed many people. Nepal needs hope. Let’s pray for Nepal.” Twenty-one-year-old Lama Padma Gyapso said, “My family is safe, but I am sad that so many people died. I cannot stop crying when I see pictures and images of Nepal right after the earthquake.”

Gurung Sagar said, “I want the Nepalese government to send materials not only to urban areas but also to rural areas. I want them to use international support effectively.”
