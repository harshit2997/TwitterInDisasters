KATHMANDU, April 26 (Xinhua) -- People in shock and panic have flocked in the Kathmandu airport on Sunday following a powerful earthquake that have killed over 1,800 in Nepal, while local residents stayed outdoors overnight for fear of aftershocks.

Hours ago, the airport was temporarily shut down following the quake with flights canceled or delayed. Now it was opened to international search and rescue teams.
