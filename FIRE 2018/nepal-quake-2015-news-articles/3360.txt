Long wait to return home

TOWNSVILLE residents stuck in Nepal in the wake of Saturday’s earthquake face a nervous wait to see when they will be able to fly home.

For Townsville doctor Greg Canning and his wife Veronika it was an unexpected twist to the holiday celebrating their wedding anniversary.

The Cannings had been trekking in Nepal and had just arrived at their accommodation in Pokhara, 80km east of the quake’s epicentre, when it hit.

Dr Canning said the room started shaking, whistles sounded and they had to evacuate quickly.

“It shook violently for two to three minutes,” he said.

“We didn’t see a lot of damage apart from some cracks in buildings.” On Monday night the couple returned to Kathmandu in a van, where it was a different story.

“Here in Kathmandu, we drove through eerie empty streets with damaged buildings, with people in makeshift tents,” Ms Canning said.

“It’s really hard looking at the damage. The places we’ve been in just a few days ago are completely flattened.”

Yesterday they were at a hotel where they had to wait for structural inspections before they could check into their room.

David Hine was also in Pokhara, where he runs a free hearing clinic, when the earthquake hit.

For Mr Hine, the last few days have involved collecting money to send blankets, food, medicine and other supplies to affected areas.

“We managed to get enough to send one helicopter back to a village and we want to send another,” he said.

Mr Hine plans to return to Townsville in mid-May.

Several James Cook University medical students were also working in various Kathmandu hospitals but are believed to be safe.

Meanwhile, Townsville surgeon and urogynaecologist Professor Ajay Rane says the Maternity Hospital of Kathmandu, where he has carried out humanitarian work has been devastated.

“We believe within six months we should have it all back in action.”

Professor Rane plans to fly to Nepal in July to help with the recovery.
