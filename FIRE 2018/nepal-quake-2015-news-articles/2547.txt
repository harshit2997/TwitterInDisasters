Reports: EU refuses to evacuate Belarsuains from Nepal
</headline>

<text>
Belarusians have been refused evacuation from Nepal on a free airplane for Europeans. An employee of the company evacuating people from Nepal advised that Belarusians joined the EU if they wanted to leave areas hit by natural disasters together with EU citizens, Novy Chas reports.

4310 people were killed in the heavy earthquake in Nepal. 7853 were injured and thousands of buildings were destroyed. Tremors have been appearing for three days already. Belarusian tourists are trying to leave the country but the airports are full.

“Some Embassies have been evacuating EU citizens today,” Belarusian Lyubou Pranevich told Novy Chas. She was in Katmandu at the moment of the earthquake. “We were sending a German boy to Thailand for medical treatment. We were at the airport. Belgians refused to take us on board the plane that was evacuating people. Belarusians are not Europeans, an employee of their company said. I told her that we were from Europe. And she replied: ‘You are not from the European Union’. Then were asked her what we had to do. The woman responded: ‘Join the European Union.’”

It is still not clear how many Belarusian citizens are in Nepal now.
