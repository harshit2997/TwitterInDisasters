BANGKOK, 6 May 2015 – The Public Health Ministry has planned to compile lessons from its sending of medical teams to Nepal, hoping to use them in developing an emergency response guidebook for similar efforts in Thailand, Dr.Surachet Satitniramai, acting Permanent Secretary for Public Health revealed.

Dr.Surachet said that the guidebook should contain lessons and experiences the Thai medical teams have gained while working with international relief teams in Nepal. The lessons will be useful to both medical staff and people in Thailand if they need to face similar disasters.

After nearly two weeks since the quake, the Nepalese government has decided to end its rescue mission and concentrate on the country’s restoration. The Thai rescue team also adjusted its mission in line with the Nepalese plan.

The second Thai medical team is to be sent to replace the MERT team which is working at the Field Hospital in Sipaghat Subdistrict and about to end their mission on 7 May. The new team will focus on mobile service in which they will walk into affected villages in mountainous terrain to advice local residents on environmental health and sanitation, disease control, mental health, food and toilet hygiene.

The team will comprise twenty four members and is scheduled to leave for Nepal on 7 May. They will also take 120,000 packets of drinking water powder donated by Her Royal Highness Princess Soamsawali for distribution to villagers in remote mountainous areas in order to prevent them from digestive diseases.
