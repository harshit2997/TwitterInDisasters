Moderator climbs Ben Lomond in aid of Nepal
</headline>

<text>
The Moderator of the Church of Scotland has led a climb of Ben Lomond to raise funds for the emergency relief effort in Nepal.

The Rt Rev John Chalmers was accompanied by the Moderator of the Church of Scotland’s Youth Assembly, Rachel Hutcheson and other supporters.

The climb was originally organised in conjunction with Christian Aid to celebrate its 70th anniversary. Following last week’s devastating earthquake the Moderators decided all proceeds should benefit those most in need in Nepal.

“The Munro Challenge was a way for us to highlight the exceptional work of Christian Aid and to help raise some much needed extra funds in this the 70 year since their foundation.

“But, tragically this very week in the mountains of Nepal a dire emergency has arisen and our good intention has now become an urgent cause. All the funds raised this Saturday on Ben Lomond are going directly to Christian Aid’s Nepal Earthquake Appeal.”

So far, almost £6,000 has been donated directly to the online donations page set up for the event. Rt Rev John Chalmers said “This has been an extraordinary response to a terrible tragedy. I would like to express my thanks to everyone who has taken part and to the people who sponsored the walkers. Their generosity has exceeded all expectations.”

Donations can still be pledged: at as well as the DEC appeal.

See the Stornoway Gazette out on Thursday, May 7th for more stories about the fundraising efforts taking place locally to aid the people of Nepal.
