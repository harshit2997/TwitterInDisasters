CASTRIES, St Lucia (CMC) -- The Government of St Lucia has appealed for support for the humanitarian crisis that has hit the people of Nepal and the families of some students now stranded here.







On Saturday, Nepal was rocked by a 7.8 magnitude earthquake that has led to the death of thousands.







According to a statement from the Prime Minister's office, the family homes of at least three of the students who are currently in St Lucia as a result of the Lambirds







Academy case have been destroyed and family members injured.







"Disasters of this magnitude are unpredictable. It is understandable that the students would be deeply distressed and worried by the events at home at this time," Prime Minister Kenny Anthony noted.







He said the Government extends its deep condolences and profound sadness to the students, their families and indeed, the Government and people of Nepal.



"It is sad to note that such a tragedy has occurred at a time when the students in our midst are coping with the difficult circumstances brought about by the Lambirds Academy case.















In recent weeks, they have taken to the airwaves to express their sorrow, fears and concerns. The events in Nepal would of course, complicate efforts currently underway to assist the students to be reunited with their families.















He said the government will extend whatever support it can to assist and support the students as they seek to cope with the tragedy in their homeland. Anthony called on all St Lucians to offer their prayers and support to the students in their hour of need and despair.















"This a humanitarian crisis that deserves no less of a response," the statement noted.















Four men including three from India are facing human trafficking charges after Police uncovered the alleged scam that brought 60 young people here from Nepal and the Philippines.















The group claimed that they had responded to an offer of education in hospitality, cruise and business management at the Lambirds Academy based in the northern town of Gros Islet.
