Sheffield residents raise £455,100 for Nepal

Generous Sheffield residents have so far given £455,100 to an appeal set up by the Disasters Emergency Committee to help those affected by the earthquake in Nepal.

The DEC, which is made up of 13 leading UK aid charities, said it was humbled by the scale of the UK public’s response to the crisis, which has devastated communities across Nepal and affected an estimated eight million people.

A total of £41 million has been raised since the appeal launched last Tuesday, enabling aid charities to reach tens of thousands of people with emergency supplies, including food, shelter, water and sanitation kits.

DEC Chief Executive Saleh Saeed said: “The people of Sheffield have been incredibly generous and I want to thank each and every person who has donated for their kind support.

“Thanks to the substantial contributions from cities such as Sheffield, our teams have been able to reach a large number of people in just a few days, but there is still so much more to do.

“Nearly two weeks on and the response by the UK public continues to amaze me. This money will help us to scale up efforts to reach more of the estimated eight million people affected by the devastating earthquake, which struck west of the capital Kathmandu on Saturday, April 25.

“Hundreds of thousands of people, many in remote villages, have had their homes damaged or destroyed and are in urgent need of food, water, shelter and medical care.

“Most are sleeping in the open or in make shift camps, with rain and limited accessibility of many locations making aid deliveries challenging. The funds donated by people in Sheffield and the rest of the nation will allow us to increase the humanitarian response. Despite immense challenges, aid is getting through to more and more people who desperately need it.”
