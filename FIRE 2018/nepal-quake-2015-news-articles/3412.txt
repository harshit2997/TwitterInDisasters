PETALING JAYA - There is a ray of light for the Rainbow of Life Forces (ROLF), which took 100 Nepali children under its wing last month.

Apparently in Nayapati, Kathmandu, the children would read their books, guided by the flickering flames of candles and lamps. This was their routine even in the aftermath of the earthquake.

Inside their sanctuary, the children are oblivious to the anxiety of their elders, who are frantically seeking access to food, clean water and other essentials.

"They are safe but their hometown is a mess. Power outages and road damage have practically cut off the town from its facilities, making it harder to communicate with them," said Adelyn Lim, founder of ROLF.

ROLF is a Malaysian initiative aimed at fulfilling wishes. For its Nepal base, ROLF collaborated with the Drikung Kagyu Rinchen Ling Monastery in Nayapati to grant wishes to underprivileged children.

Lim had initially received reports that some of the children were missing after the earthquake.

Thankfully, a call from the monastery late Sunday informed her that all 100 children were accounted for.

"I am trying to get airline companies to help us transport the essentials to Kathmandu," said Lim.
