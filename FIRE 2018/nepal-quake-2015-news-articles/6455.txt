Operations have resumed at the Kathmandu airport which was shut down briefly after four earthquakes struck Nepal in quick succession on Tuesday afternoon and airlines are diverting flights.Nepalese authorities ordered the closure of the Tribhuvan International Airport in Kathmandu soon after the first earthquake of 7.3 magnitude struck, sparking panic in the Nepal capital.People reportedly ran out into safety and the airport was swiftly evacuated. "The airport is closed for operations right now," Birendra Prasad Shrestha, manager at the airport, told AFP.Videos posted on social media showed people rushing out to the open and crowding the tarmac, many of them talking on the phone soon after the quake struck.The Indian Meteorological Department has described today's quakes as aftershocks of the powerful 7.9-magnitude earthquake that struck Nepal on April 25. IMD officials said they expected aftershocks to continue, perhaps for months.Four people are reported killed in Nepal's Chautara, where several buildings have reportedly collapsed.8,000 people were killed and more than 17,000 injured in the April quake. Over 50 people had died in Bihar.
