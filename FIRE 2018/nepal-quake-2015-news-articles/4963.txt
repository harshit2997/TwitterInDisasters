Service for war heroes helps Nepal quake victims

DONATIONS were raised for Nepal earthquake victims at a ceremony honouring the county’s sacrifice in the two world wars.

The cash was raised at the Turning the Pages ceremony, held in Christ Church Cathedral, on Saturday for the Disaster Emergency Committee.

It also marked the links between Oxfordshire regiments and Nepalese soldiers, known as Gurkhas, who fought together in 1857 during the Siege of Delhi in the Indian Mutiny.

Speaking after the ceremony, former Royal Green Jacket Robert Drummond, said Gurkhas fought with the King’s Royal Rifle Corps – which then became the Royal Green Jackets.

The 73-year-old, of Mixbury, near Bicester, said: “There has been a very close relationship ever since between Oxfordshire, the Green Jackets and the Gurkhas. We feel that it’s a huge tragedy and anything that can be done to help should be done.”

Almost 7,000 people were killed in the earthquake. Hundreds more are missing.

Mr Drummond also served alongside Gurkhas in Borneo during the 1960s.

He said: “It’s a country we have very strong links to for a long, long time and any help we can give should be given.”

The service started in 2002 to honour those who fought in the county’s regiments during the two world wars. It is held every two months.

The names of 20 soldiers from the Oxfordshire and Buckinghamshire Light Infantry and Queen’s Own Oxfordshire Hussars are read from a book of remembrance at the cathedral.

Among the 50-strong congregation was Ben Freeman, whose great-great-uncle Corporal Reginald Selwyn was one of those remembered.

Mr Freeman, 48, of Hurst Street, Oxford, said: “I think it’s great that they do it. We feel he has been remembered.”
