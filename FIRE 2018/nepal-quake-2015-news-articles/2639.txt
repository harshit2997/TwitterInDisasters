Bengaluru city police have warned private organisations and individuals against collecting donations for Nepal earthquake relief.

Additional Commissioner Alok Kumar has termed this as illegal and said that any such activity needs the consent of Deputy Commissioner of Bengaluru district.

Reacting to some such activities being carried out in Bengaluru, Mr. Kumar said that it has not come to his notice, but the police will take strict action if they find anybody collecting funds. There is a procedure involved for collecting donations.
