AirAsia X offers free flights to NGOs helping Nepal
</headline>

<text>
Long-haul low-fare airline AirAsia X is organising free flights to Nepal for the NGOs and humanitarian agencies. These free flights will run until 10 May 2015 and will be based on seat availability for accredited NGOs and humanitarian agencies helping in the relief missions since the earthquake.

AirAsia X acting CEO Benyamin Ismail was quoted saying that as a carrier that frequents this route and market, it will stand by to offer as much of its service as possible. This is not the first time the group has helped with relief efforts. It was also involved in helping with relief aid during the 2004 Tsunami and Cyclone Nargis that hit Myanmar the same year.

Meanwhile, UNICEF Malaysia also announced that it was setting up a fund for the children in Nepal affected by the earthquake. Several other brands have also rallied together to help do their part following the earth quake that hit last week.
