Julie Bowen Best Actress In a Supporting Nepal Role

Julie Bowen -- Best Actress in a Supporting Nepal Role (PHOTO)

Julie Bowen knows the old saying -- when life hands you a deadly earthquake ... make lemonade -- to raise money for the victims of that deadly earthquake.

The "Modern Family" star and her kids joined the Nepal relief effort on Thursday with double barrels of lemon"aid" -- hawking the refreshments to hikers in L.A.'s Fryman Canyon. Even when her kids bailed for a few hours ... Julie held down the fort, solo.

It's like watching an episode of her show play out in real life, just without Sofia Vergara. Which sucks ... but it's for charity, so man up.
