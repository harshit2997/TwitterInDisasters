A group of students who returned from Nepal days before the earthquake hit have raised over £12,000 for the disaster fund.

Over 30 pupils from Tunbridge Wells Grammar School for Boys travelled to the country as part of a World Challenge expedition.

The group trekked across parts of the country, visited historic landmarks and temples before offering support to villages and schools.

Each year over 500 schools take part in the world challenge and send teams away to developing countries across the world. Students take responsibility for leading the trip and fund it themselves.

All pupils and staff safely returned from the trip days before the earthquake hit.

After hearing of the devastation caused to parts of the country they had visited, the schoolboys decided to raise money to support the disaster fund.

After two cake sales, a non uniform day and the promotion of an online giving site set up by the boys they have raised £12,450.

Michael Fallon visited the students during their cake sale in Sevenoaks to show his support.

Rachel Lovera - who accompanied the boys on their trip and is the mother of a man who was feared missing when the quake hit - said she is so proud of them.

She added: "It's an amazing effort and I'm so proud. They really want to thank everyone who supported them."
