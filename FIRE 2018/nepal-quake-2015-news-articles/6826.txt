Fourteen chefs from 11 of Hong Kong’s best restaurants will create a unique dinner and wine pairing on Monday in aid of people affected by the recent devastating earthquakes.

Food aid: Tate Dining Room and Bar's Vicky Lau is one of the 14 chefs who will help create the menu.





Held at The Principal in Star Street, Wan Chai, all proceeds from the event Rise to Aid Nepal will go directly to Child Welfare Scheme, a charity dedicated to helping children in Nepal and their families.

After cocktails, champagne and canapés, there will be a 10-course tasting dinner with paired wines and features dishes from Hong Kong’s top chefs, including Nathan Green of 22 Ships, Chris Whitmore and Jessica Wu at Aberdeen Street Social, Alvin Leing and Dave Yu from Bo innovation and Vicky Lau from Tate Dining Room & Bar.

Event bartenders will be on hand such as Tunny Grattidge of Chachawan, Ryan Nightingale of Ham & Sherry and Joanna Francoise Kent of The Pawn with Ruinart providing the Champagne.

During the evening a silent auction will be held to raise additional funds. Guests can bid on a number of donated experiences, including: Dinner for 12 at home provided by 22 Ships, a sunset cruise, a stay at the Landmark Mandarin Oriental, dinner for four at Caprice and a 3-night luxury stay in Koh Samui.

22 Ships chef, Nathan Green commented: “I am honoured to come together with 13 highly respected Hong Kong chefs for the Rise fundraiser on Monday. The devastating effects of the tragic Nepal earthquakes hit close to home for all of us, as many of our colleagues hail from Nepal and some of their families have been directly affected. Hosting this event is the least we can do to show our support for the Nepalese community and, through Child Welfare Scheme, help to rebuild some of what they have lost.”

The reception starts at 7.15pm and costs HKD$3,800 per person. For tickets, please click here.
