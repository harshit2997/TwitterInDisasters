Israeli surrogate babies begin evacuation from Nepal

Posted on by Citizen Zed

Three surrogate-born babies and their Israeli parents were evacuated from Nepal, according to the Guardian. The families travelled in a small military plane that had transported a team of doctors who were dispatched to aid in the rescue efforts following Saturdays deadly earthquake.

According to the Guardian report, the babies were the few of many babies born to same-sex male couples in Nepal via surrogate mothers, as surrogacy for gay couples is illegal in Israel. Another 22 babies are awaiting evacuation, along with their parents who had made their way before the earthquake struck.

Yossi Filiba, from Tel Aviv, arrived in Nepal over three weeks ago for the birth of his baby girl, Naama. He was feeding his daughter in his apartment when the earthquake struck. I grabbed the baby, ran down three floors and out to open space. All around us, small buildings were collapsing and people were terrified, he said. With little food, water or electricity, Filiba and other Israeli couples are anxiously awaiting the Israeli air force to evacuate them.

Surrogate parents tend to arrive in Nepal one month in advance of their childs birth, in order to arrange the formalities for bringing the baby home, according to Filiba.

An 80-member search-and-rescue team is already in Nepal and the Israeli military plan to send other aircraft with a field hospital and medical personnel later on Monday, said the Guardian.

The revision of Israels surrogacy laws are under consideration by Israels parliament.

Surrogate babies? So these are not real babies? That's racist or something.

Sounds like homos preying upon the poor.

They’ll pay a poor woman to bear a baby, wrench apart the maternal-baby bond, put her baby in the household of two sexually confused men, never come back.

Heteros do it, too. What about the babies’ mothers? Is someone concerned with rescuing them?



To: Tax-chick

Perhaps. Which doesn’t make it right. However the article specifically states, “the babies were the few of many babies born to same-sex male couples in Nepal via surrogate mothers, as surrogacy for gay couples is illegal in Israel.” From this I take that surrogacy for hetero couples is legal in Israel, hence no need to travel to impoverished Nepal.

"What about the babies mothers? Is someone concerned with rescuing them?" Good question, Tax-chick. Of course, I suppose since they are just human incubators, they're not worth all that much? There are some things I hate about this world.



To: Ray76

Perhaps. Unquestionably. Which doesnt make it right. No, it doesn't. It spreads the wrongness to a larger population. There have also been articles regarding surrogacy for Israeli homosexual men in Thailand.



To: Mrs. Don-o

I understand that India is organizing large-scale relief efforts for the citizens of Nepal. I feel so sad for these women.



To: Citizen Zed

Yet another deficiency of “gay” “marriage”: children of such “marriages” must be provided by third parties.



To: Tax-chick

So again, homos preying upon the poor.

Yes. Rich white people, whether homosexual or heterosexual, like to buy eggs from people who look like them. American (and, one assumes, Israeli) college girls are popular, as are light-skinned and blonde Eastern Europeans such as Ukrainians, Russians, Lithuanians. They like South Asian women for gestators, because they’re inexpensive and (other than poverty) have healthy lifestyles: vegetarian, no alcohol, don’t use drugs. Thailand, India, and apparently Nepal also have good “Western” medical infrastructure available for those who can pay.



To: Tax-chick

The article is specifically about homo’s exploiting women in impoverished countries where homo surrogacy is legal. Hetero surrogacy is legal many countries hence no need to exploit women in impoverished “third world” countries. You seem to have a horse in the race. That’s your biz. I don’t want to know. Quit trying to make an equivalency where there is none.
