City-based Nepalese gather in their grief

<text>
As crushing disaster struck across India's mountainous northern border, the fairly prolific Nepali community in Pune found itself utterly helpless when it comes to extending a helping hand to fellow countrymen in this time of immense crisis.On Sunday, clearly shaken members of the Pune-based Nepalese community requested that the government here open a dedicated counter at the Nepalese embassy, for them to receive information about their family members and friends back home.Currently, more than 50,000 Nepalese live in Pune. At a solemn gathering on Sunday at the Vimalabai Garware High School, the Nepalese Social Association also paid homage to the climbing number of victims of the deadly earthquake, which has already claimed upward of 2,500 lives. Members of the association subsequently discussed ways in which they could help victims and survivors back home.Dilipsingh Vishwakarma, president of the association, told Mirror, "We are thankful to the Indian government for its aid. Authorities are really doing a wonderful job of helping out our people. However, we wish for both the Indian and Nepal governments to also carry out rescue operations in the interiors of the country, where thousands of people are feared trapped."Some Nepalese nationals here have lost entire properties in Saturday's deadly quake. Sanjeev Kharel, who has worked in Pune for the last couple of years, said his hotel in Kathmandu was completely razed. "My elder brother looks after our hotel back in the capital," he said, adding, "On Saturday, when the earth started shaking, a whole wall of the hotel fell down due to the powerful tremors. Fortunately, the hotel was locked and the entire staff was outside, so there were zero casualties."Other Nepalese in Pune have lost friends in the tragedy, compounding their sorrow and helplessness. A sombre Nirap Vishwakarma, who also works here, said he lost both friends and kin to the unexpected disaster. "My friend, who was supposed to come to Pune next week, has lost several relatives in this calamity. My heart goes out to him and I am alsofrustrated and helpless that I cannot be there to help my loved ones," he lamented.We wish for both Indian and Nepal govts to also rescue people in the interiors of the country, where thousands are feared trapped
