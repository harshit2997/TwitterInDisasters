KUALA LUMPUR: Malaysia is sending 30 members of an elite rescue team along with 20 medical doctors to help in the rescue and relief efforts for the Nepal earthquake, Malaysian Prime Minister Najib Razak announced on Sunday (Apr 26).

Mr Najib's statement in full:

The Malaysian Government is aware that search and rescue operations are still ongoing in Nepal due to the devastating earthquake which hit the country and the Northern India region yesterday.

We will be deploying 30 members from the Special Malaysia Disaster Assistance and Rescue Team (SMART) together with the necessary equipment to Nepal in the shortest time possible.

We have also secured the services of 20 medical doctors from our volunteer relief organizations â€“ MERCY Malaysia and the Malaysian Red Crescent Society who will depart alongside the SMART members together with medicines and medical supplies onboard a Royal Malaysian Air Force C130 aircraft.

The C130 aircraft will be on standby there to evacuate all Malaysians who are in the region and we will bring them home to Kuala Lumpur safely.

On behalf of Malaysia, I extend my condolences to those who lost their family and friends in the earthquake. Malaysia will continue to provide all possible assistance to Nepal in overcoming this disaster.
