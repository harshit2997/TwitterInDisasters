</headline>

<text>
Four Indian Air Force aircraft carrying relief material had to return from Kathmandu as the airport was already choca-bloc with other aircraft bearing similar supplies. "Kathmandu Airport is under tremendous pressure. It is difficult to get the landing slots," Foreign Secretary S Jaishankar said.Army officials are now working to streamline the unloading of relief material. "We will be flying another four aircraft tonight, hopefully the airport would have cleared by then," defence secretary RP Mathur said.The planes were carrying, food, water, RO Machines, oxygen tanks among other things. A team of Indian power grid officials have also been flown in to restore power in Kathmandu.A total of 5,400 Indian nationals have been evacuated from the quakehit Nepal, the first lot of 2100 persons were rescued by Indian Airforce. The Indian Air Force has also rescued 30 foreign nationals. According to Jaishankar, these were mostly the injured and elderly.The MEA does not have a clear idea as to how many Indians are still trapped in Nepal, considering Indians can visit the country without a passport. "We cannot say with certainty as to how many Indian nationals are there. The situation is dynamic. Every day, more people are coming forward seeking help at our embassy," he added."We have more or less rescued everyone in affected areas of the country. The states have not sought anymore help as of now," home secretary LC Goyal said.Jaishankar said the reopening of roads in Nepal has facilitated the movement of nearly 150 buses carrying relief material and medical teams from Uttarakhand, Uttar Pradesh and Bihar."In last 48 hours, our relief work has been primarily via the air route but now things are improving. We have deployed the army's engineering wing to clear the landslides," Jaishankar added.The Indian Army is also seeking help from ex-servicemen from the Gorkha Rifles. "Since they are residents of Nepal, they are more familiar with the landscape and will be able to help us better with navigating the terrain," Mathur said.Additional bogies have been attached to the trains going to Gorakhpur and Birganj, close to Nepal border, so that people coming from Nepal can easily get a berth.
