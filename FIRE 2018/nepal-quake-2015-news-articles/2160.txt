Metro man raising money for earthquake survivors in Nepal

A metro man is raising money to help his community back in Nepal, where a major aftershock hit Sunday.

The death toll from Saturday’s earthquake has now rise to more than 2,500 people.

JK Koirala is no stranger to Mother Nature’s wrath; he’s lived in Oklahoma for the past several years.

But the powerful 7.8 magnitude earthquake that rocked his hometown in Nepal Saturday leaves him with a pain he’s never felt before.

“It makes me really sad, it makes me want to go over there right now to help,” Koirala said.

More than 2,400 people in Nepal alone have been killed.

The capital city of Kathmandu was hit hardest.

Home, temples, and major tourist attractions were toppled in that city of 3 million people.

A 6.7 magnitude aftershock made matters worse Sunday.

Koirala spoke with his mother after it happened.

“She’s like, ‘I feel like we’re all going to die’ because the land is going crazy, landslides and everything,” Koirala said.

Koirala’s family lives outside the city. They say it’s hard for people in those hillside areas to get medical attention.

Rescuers are working around the clock looking for survivors.

Overnight Sunday, they took more than 160 bodies to a single hospital in Kathmandu.

Koirala is counting his blessing that all his family survived, but life will never be the same.

“My dad, he has four brothers, all of their houses are gone, the whole neighborhood, the whole community. They’re just living outside,” Koirala said.

He’s raising money to return to his home country for the first time in seven years to see his family and help rebuild the community where he grew up.

According to U.S. State Department officials, three U.S. citizens were killed in the earthquake.

An American search and rescue team is scheduled to arrive in Nepal Monday.
