Jacob Hug was on a military helicopter when it went down Tuesday. It had been delivering aid to earthquake victims.

His father grew up in Council Bluffs and most of Hug's family still lives in the Omaha metro. They all want answers and help, after the UH-1 Huey helicopter their son was flying on in Nepal disappeared on a supply mission to the earthquake-ravaged country.

Hug last spoke with his mother on Sunday for Mother's Day, a phone call he made from Nepal.

Marines told his father that the chopper vanished, no smoke, no distress call, no beacon. Even after three days of searching, they have yet to be found.

"Our guys are there. They are down. They need our help," Jim Hug, Jacob's father, said. "There are resources not there on the ground. We need help to find them. We hope and pray that they are OK. We don't have any information that says that they're not. We need to find them. We need to get the resources over there. Let's get these guys on the ground there to find our guys, people that are sworn to protect us. Let's have their back on this and say that we're doing everything we can."
