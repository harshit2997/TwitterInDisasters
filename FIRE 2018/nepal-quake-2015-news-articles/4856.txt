The European Union on Monday approved 20 million euros ($22 million) in financial support and emergency aid to help Nepal deal with the devastating April 25th earthquake that killed more than 7,200 people. The EU commitment came after a request for help from the Nepalese government, which said it was facing a huge funding gap if there was no increase in international help. Beyond the 16.6 million euros in financial support and 3 million euros in emergency aid, EU Commissioner Neven Mimica said ``as soon as the needs assessments are completed, we will look into how we can further assist.'' The earthquake has shattered the economy of Nepal, one of the world's poorest nations.

Meanwhile nine days after the earthquake, the Nepal government has asked foreign countries to wrap up search and rescue operations saying there is no hope of finding people alive in the rubble. Dozens of countries sent teams to look for survivors after the Himalayan nation was hit by a 7.8-magnitude quake, but the Nepal government now believes the search and rescue work has been nearly completed. "They can leave. If they are also specialists in clearing the rubble, they can stay," Rameshwor Dangal, an official at Nepal's home ministry, told Reuters on Monday.

The quake killed 7,276 people and wounded over 14,300. Nepalese Prime Minister Sushil Koirala earlier estimated the death toll could reach 10,000. The United Nations has said 8 million of Nepal's 28 million people were affected by the quake, with at least 2 million needing tents, water, food and medicines over the next three months. ‎On Monday, police and local volunteers found the bodies of about 100 trekkers and villagers buried in an avalanche set off by the earthquake in a remote district and were digging through snow and ice for scores more missing.

Many countries have pledged money that will be necessary to rebuild homes, hospitals and historic buildings. Others such as neighbouring India have sent trucks to deliver aid and deployed helicopters to rescue thousands of people from remote towns and villages. (Source: AP)
