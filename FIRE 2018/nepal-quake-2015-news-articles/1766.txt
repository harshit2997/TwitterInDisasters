Nepalese-Quebecers anxiously await news after earthquake
</headline>

Muga Rajbhandari woke up at 3 a.m. Saturday to a text message telling him his home country had been hit by a massive earthquake.

The Nepalese-Montrealer frantically tried contacting his brother near Mount Everest and his sister in Kathmandu.

He finally got through to both about three hours later.

"They told me that they are safe but nobody at home. They are outside of the home, scared that the earthquake comes again," Rajbhandari said.

He said he hasn't received any bad news about his friends and family members to date.

But many were not so lucky. More than 2,500 have died in the 7.8-magnitude earthquake that struck just outside of Kathmandu on Saturday, and the death toll continues to rise.

A 6.7-magnitude aftershock on Sunday created further devastation in the region.

Rajbhandari said Quebec's Nepalese community of about 100 families is small and close-knit.

He said people are glued to their cellphones, waiting for news from friends and relatives to come in by text or on social media.

The community is encouraging people to donate online to the Association of Nepalese in Quebec.

Organizers said the money raised will go straight to international aid groups such as the Red Cross.
