Earthquake Jolts Seattle-Area Nepalese Into Action
</headline>

<text>
Bells rang out at a temple in Bothell on Sunday, where more than a hundred came to pray, light candles and share updates about the massive earthquake in Nepal.

An estimated 3,000 to 4,000 Nepalese people live in the Seattle area, and many are turning to each other for support. Officials have confirmed that more than 5,000 people died in the 7.8-magnitude earthquake.

Among those attending the service on Sunday, Sudha Bogati said her family in Kathmandu is safe, but they’re sleeping outside because of the ongoing aftershocks.

“On top of that it’s raining,” Bogati said.

She said the needs in Nepal are “shelter and dry food and medication, and water, I think. Yeah, that’s what I’m getting from my parents back home.”

Several at the vigil said they intend to return to Nepal to help with the recovery and rebuilding in the weeks, months or years ahead.

Mohan Gurung, president of the Nepal Seattle Society is going to Washington, D.C., this week to meet with Nepal’s ambassador to see how his group can help in the relief effort. He, too, plans to return soon to Nepal.

“Those that are in that area, they’re traumatized,” Gurung said. “They can’t do anything. So the ones who can help are from outside.”
