A team of 57 men and women, plus six search dogs, left for Nepal on Sunday from Dover Air Force Base.

The Fairfax County team is one of two in the country that deploys to international disasters in coordination with the U.S. Agency for International Development. The other team, from Los Angeles, has also deployed.

The search-and-rescue teams are entirely self-sustaining for periods of two weeks or more.

Fairfax County’s team was in the midst of a multi-day training exercise over the weekend when the earthquake struck in Nepal. More than 3,700 people have been killed.

The Fairfax team last deployed internationally in June 2014 in response to flooding in Paraguay.
