Thai government launches campaign to help Nepal

<text>
The Thai humanitarian teams will be flying to the country closest to Nepal before proceeding into affected areas, as Nepalâ€™s international airport has been temporarily closed as a result of the tremor, deputy government spokesman Sansern Kaewkamnerd said Sunday.

The Thai Embassy in Nepal will facilitate the trip. Thai people could help alleviate the hardships of the Nepalese by donating necessary items for survival or money via all the Damrongdhama centers, under the Interior Ministry across the country.

The government will also hold a charity program for Nepal, which will be broadcast live on Channel 5 next week.

Thai people living in Nepal and nearby countries affected by the massive quake can contact the Thai Embassy in Nepal for help.
