Fatal Mount Everest avalanche captured by German climber

A champion German climber on the trip of a lifetime has captured the fear and panic at Everest Base Camp when a killer avalanche struck.

Jost Kobusch, 22, was at the 5364m-high camp in Nepal on Saturday when the ground beneath him began to shake.

A few nervous laughs quickly turned into mortal fear as the former army mountaineer filmed climbers and sherpas frantically trying to rush to safety.

"The ground was shaking from the earthquake and as soon as we saw people running we were running ourselves to save our lives," the German wrote online.

Kobusch and other mountaineers sought refuge in a nearby tent and huddled under a jacket as the chaos unfolded all around them.

In the video they can be heard breathing heavily in fear as the avalanche sweeps through the camp.

When they finally emerge from their shelter, the full impact of the avalanche dawns on them.

"There is no kitchen tent… the kitchen tent is down," Kobusch says.

The 22-year-old has been on a mountaineering trip in Nepal since early this month.

Last year Kobusch set a world record on Nepal's 6812m high Ama Dablam Mountain, according to his website.

More than 2000 people including one Australian have been killed by the 7.9 magnitude quake that struck Nepal on Saturday, triggering a number of avalanches including the deadly one at Everest Base Camp.
