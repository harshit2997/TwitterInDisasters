Little Nepal to Host Fundraiser for Nepali Earthquake Victims
</headline>

<text>
As the dust settles following the devastating 7.8 magnitude earthquake in Nepal, the death toll continues to climb. And while the country may feel a world away from the San Francisco Bay Area, the effects of the tragedy are already impacting the tight-knit Nepali community.

Prem Tamang, executive chef and manager of Bernal Heights' Little Nepal, is from the district of Kavrepalanchok in Nepal. The area has been severely impacted by the earthquake, leaving Tamang's family and friends struggling amidst the rubble with limited resources. "It is heartbreaking to see hometown people struggling like this," he says. "When it happened, I asked 'what can I do?' "

That's why Tamang, with the organizational help of customer Chasa Toliver, is hosting a fundraiser to benefit the residents of his district. On Thursday, April 30 Tamang will serve a special menu, with all proceeds going directly to his hometown. The menu will include limited choice of an appetizer, entree and side in exchange for a cash-only donation (suggestion amount is $20-$30). The menu will be available during the restaurant's normal hours of 5 p.m.-10 p.m. for as long as supplies last; guests should inform the host or server that they are joining for the donation-only meal. Regular customers have already been dropping in, offering support and donations; donations will be accepted at the restaurant for the next few days for those who cannot dine but wish to donate.

If he can make arrangements for his restaurant to run smoothly in his absence, Tamang hopes to travel to Nepal himself to assist family and friends in the recovery process. "I want to make sure that I can get support to the people who need it, by sending it directly to those in my hometown. They've all lost their homes."
