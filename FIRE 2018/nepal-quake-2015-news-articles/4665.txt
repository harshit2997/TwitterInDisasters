Former Wisconsin Badger and Wausau native Andy Crooks is coming home after he was stuck in Nepal following a massive earthquake.

Crooks now lives in the Madison area.

He, his wife and sister-in-law were hiking Mt. Everest when the quake struck. Luckily, no one was hurt.

Crooks' uncle, Thom Leck, tells NewsChannel 7 they flew out of Nepal Saturday and are supposed to land in Chicago Sunday.

Leck says they are just happy to be coming home.

Crooks and his family want to extend a huge thank you to everyone for their thoughts and prayers.
