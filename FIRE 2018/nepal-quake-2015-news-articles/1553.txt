Viber Offers Earthquake Victims Free International Calls From Nepal
</headline>

<text>
The earthquake in Nepal is a devastating one that has left thousands dead with many more injured and/or missing. So far we’ve seen various efforts from governments around the world who are offering relief, with big name companies such as Apple, Facebook, and Google offering up relief of their own, or at least facilitating it in some way.

To do their part in helping those affected by the earthquake, Viber has recently announced that they will offer those in Nepal affected by the disaster free outgoing international calls. According to Viber, “In response to the earthquake in Nepal, we have switched off Viber Out billing so Nepal users can call any destination for free.” This will be of great importance as the country’s communication lines have been disconnected during the earthquake, not to mention there is also a shortage of power as a result.

So with Viber offering up an alternate means of communications, it will allow those in Nepal a chance to contact their loved ones in other countries to let them know that they are safe. That being said what about those who are trying to call Nepal? The good news is that the company has also stated that they will be allowing free calls to Nepalese mobile and landline numbers through the Viber Out feature. So if there is something you’re trying to reach, you can use Viber to try and get in touch with them at no cost.
