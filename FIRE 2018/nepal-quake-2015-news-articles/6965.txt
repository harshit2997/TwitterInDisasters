SURAT: At a time when Prime Minister Narendra Modi is preparing for his power-packed visit to China, four Surti friends on a road journey to Europe via China to spread the message Food for All have been forced to suspended their trip.They were denied entry into China from the Katmandu border two days ago by the Chinese custom officials, who said that borders were sealed due to the earthquake in Nepal and they were not allowing Indians and Nepalese citizens to enter the country even if they had a valid Chinese visa.Four friends Dr Ashok Patel, Chetan Desai, Dr Paresh Desai and Dr Rajan Desai are presently in New Delhi and have applied for the Chinese visa again. But now they have changed their route and will be entering China via Myanmar.They began their 16,000 km-long journey to London by road in an SUV from Surat on May 1. Rajan is ophthalmic surgeon while Ashok is MD, Paresh an orthopedic surgeon and Chetan Desai a businessman.In the past, world tours from Gujarat to Europe were through the Middle East. But these four friends decided to go via China because of the unrest in Middle East following activities of terror outfit ISIS in the region.These friends spreading the message of Food for All, will traverse through 15 countries across two continents and cover 37 cities. Of this route 5,700 km is hilly terrain, while 2,100 km passes through desert.Speaking to TOI from Delhi, Dr Rajan Desai said, "Chinese have sealed the border due to the Nepal tragedy. It was so disheartening for all of us. We even requested the Chinese customs officials to allow us drive through, but they were adamant.""We have reapplied for the China visa. Now, we are awaiting the response from the Chinese embassy," he added.According to Desai, they have reorganized the entire tour due to the China issue. "Now because of the delay at China border we will have to get fresh visa for Russia," Dr Rajan said, adding that if things went as per new plan they would resume their journey in next few days.They will be passing from through Tibet, China, Kyrgyzstan, Kazakhstan, Russia, Belarus, Poland, Czech Republic, Austria, Germany and the Netherlands. From the Netherlands they are supposed to ship their car to New Castle and from there to Edinburgh and then to London to end the trip.
