PHILADELPHIA, PA(WPMT) Philadelphia based Comcast joins the list of communications giants offering free calls to Nepal.

“Our hearts go out to all those impacted by the devastating Earthquake in Katmandu, Nepal – the victims, their families and their loved ones. During this extremely difficult time, we want to help our customers unite with their families and friends in the aftermath. Therefore, Comcast will provide free calls to Nepal for our more than 11 million Xfinity Voice residential customers.

This will apply to all calls made to Nepal by customers between April 25 through May 31. Credits and waived fees will be automatic and no action will be required by customers.

We will continue to keep all those impacted by this tragic event in our thoughts and prayers and wish them strength during these trying times.”
