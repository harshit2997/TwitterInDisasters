Body of Israeli retrieved by buddies

The body of Israeli hiker Or Asraf was retrieved from a remote area of Nepal and was returned to Israel. The Israel rescue teams took the body extracted from a rocky mountainside in the Langtang area and airlifted it to Kathmandu.

Several of Asraf’s army comrades and his commander, who had arrived in Kathmandu to join in the search, carried the body on a stretcher after extracting it from a mountainside struck by rock slides and sent a message to his mother: “This is our last journey with our friend. We are bringing him home to you,” the IDF said in a statement.

Several European hikers also died in the same area, which was hit by rock slides and heavy rain in the wake of the 7.8 magnitude earthquake that hit Nepal on April 25.

Asraf, 22, had been traveling with members of his former Israeli army unit, but left for a hike on his own shortly before the quake hit. The death toll was at least 7,200. Hundreds of Israelis were in the area at the time of the quake; Asraf was the only Israeli fatality. (JTA)
