Kiwis still missing in earthquake-devastated Nepal

Fourteen New Zealanders remain missing in Nepal after Saturday's devastating 7.8 magnitude earthquake.

The Kiwis are listed on a Red Cross register where family and friends of New Zealanders not heard from can list their loved ones as missing.

Today the Ministry of Foreign Affairs confirmed a New Zealander has died in Nepal but say the death was not related to the earthquake.

The New Zealand Government has responded to the unfolding humanitarian crisis in the Himalayan nation by pledging $1million in aid.

A New Zealand Red Cross team of three telecommunications specialists will head to Nepal today to help fix broken network infrastructure.

Nepal's Home Ministry said today the country's death toll had risen to 4,010 people.
