UPDATE: Joshua just contacted us about five minutes ago and he is safe! He made it to Beni Nepal. Dodged some landslides and rocks along the way but is alright. Our hearts are so full!

Joshua Edwards, 19, from Bend, Oregon has been missing since the Nepal Quake Saturday morning. He last spoke with his father the evening of October 20th and was in the City of Muktinath. He was heading out the next day towards Annapurna Conservation Area which is close to the epicenter of the quake. He is an elite rock climber. He is 5'10" tall with brown hair and eyes. A distinguishing characteristic: he looks almost exactly like a young Tom Cruise and gets stopped often about this. I've attached three photos . He is a beautiful soul and very kind. He loves life, adventure , rock climbing and his family. Please help us find him... we love him so very much.



With kindness,

Joshua's AuntSusan, his wonderful father/my big brother John Edwards and his siblings, Jennifer, Sarah and Christina.
