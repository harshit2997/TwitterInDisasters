DENVER – They were about four hours into a hike north of Kathmandu when the massive earthquake hit Nepal.

Coloradans Della Hoffman and Eric Jean had just stopped in a village along their route when the ground started moving.

"We kind of stood up and tried to figure out where the best place was to be," Jean said. "Then the mountain, the sides of the canyon that we were in, just started breaking off and falling down and that's when it became pretty serious."

That was the beginning of a four-day ordeal for Jean and Hoffman. They joined a group of other hikers and some villagers to create a camp where they could live outside near the town, as aftershocks continued day and night.

"Throughout the wait, you would almost, like things would start to feel ok. And you would start to almost feel like ok, here we are camping and then the earth would shake again, or you would hear the rocks coming down further down the path or across the river," Hoffman said.

One hiker they met up with had a satellite messaging device so they were able to contact their families to get help.

A few rescue helicopters started arriving the next day for people from other countries. There were a few days when they didn't hear any helicopters, they found out later the weather had turned bad in Kathmandu. Then on the morning of the fourth day the special forces arrived.

"When it landed, and the guys got out, I mean from their voices and their appearance I knew they were American and that was a huge relief," Hoffman said. "At the same time I remember bursting into tears immediately, knowing, feeling this guilt that if I have to leave everyone else who's here that I've been surviving with…"

But there was this moment where one of the special forces guys said "don't worry we're going to get everyone out today," and then there was just a feeling of joy and elation."

Hoffman and Jean ended up staying for the next few days at the U.S. Embassy in Kathmandu until they were able to get a flight out to come home.

Both of them say they want people to remember Nepal, not only with donations now, but if possible to help in the rebuilding process and later for americans to go there as tourists again.
