Cavan credit unions, in partnership with the Irish League of Credit Unions International Development Foundation (The Foundation), which is the charitable arm of the Irish credit union movement, have pledged up to €50,000 to help those affected by the disastrous earthquake in Nepal.

A major element of the fund, administered by the ‘Foundation’ in conjunction with other international credit union bodies, will go towards supporting the revitalisation of Nepalese credit unions, which were destroyed, and to support staff and members affected by one of the worst natural disasters in recent times.

The fund, which is backed by credit unions and their members’ from across the island of Ireland, will ensure that members can begin to rebuild their homes, lives and support for their families.

Recent reports suggest that at least 5,500 people have died, over 10,000 people injured and 2.8 million people have been displaced from their homes. The earthquake has affected the whole country and millions of people are in need of immediate food assistance. Recovery efforts will take time and there has been a huge response from credit union movements across the globe.

It was the most powerful disaster to strike Nepal since the 1934 Nepal–Bihar earthquake and the country is at continued risk of landslides as well. The ILCU Foundation will update credit unions and their members with regard to its recovery efforts via its website - www.ilcufoundation.ie or on Facebook - ILCU Foundation.”
