Charities team up to help devastation across Nepal

Fundraisers in the region are pulling together to help rebuild schools and houses after the devastation in Nepal.

Collections are being made across the district following the devastating earthquake last month in which more than 7,000 people were killed and thousands more injured.

Hundreds of thousands of people were made homeless when entire villages were flattened in the quake.

Rotary and Lions clubs have been making appeals for donations to provide shelter boxes and emergency help since the disaster hit.

And in Burton Green villagers are invited to a curry night on May 15 to help rebuild and kit out schools to make lives easier in the disaster zone.

Members of the village hall committee, residents association and parish council have all come together for the food fundraiser.

Rona Taylor, chair of the residents association said all money collected will go to an agent out in Nepal where the village has contacts spread across major cities and towns.

Mrs Taylor and her husband Archie who have helped organise the event, said with money going to help specific projects, it should help pull in donations. Mr Taylor said: “We have contacts out in the epicentre zone where things are really bad and we are anxious to make sure donations go towards specific projects rather than a charity.

“We hope to help a school with equipment and things like that to help where we can.

“Burton Green is an amazing community and we know this will be well supported.”

Curries will be served in Burton Green Village Hall from 6.30pm.

Last serving is 8.30pm but the hall will stay open through the evening for groups to stay and drink, socialise and eat.

Curries are £7 per head, take away and delivery available, and donations for the bottle tombola and cake stand are welcome.

Early orders can be placed with Rona via rpataylor@gmail.com or on 02476 463844.
