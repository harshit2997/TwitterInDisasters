Bhopal, April 29 (IANS) At least 24 people from Madhya Pradesh who were stranded in Nepal following last week's devastating earthquake have been evacuated, a release said on Wednesday.

Twenty-three of these people returned to India on Wednesday while one person was reportedly safe at the Everest base camp.

A large number of people had gone on a pilgrimage to Nepal's Pashupatinath temple.

Of these people, 23 had gone for trekking and one was reported missing, following which Chief Minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan had sent a team to Kathmandu for their evacuation.

A statement issued from the public relations department on Wednesday said the 23-member group returned from Kathmandu by bus.
