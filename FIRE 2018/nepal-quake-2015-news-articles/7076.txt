SINGAPORE - The 182-strong Singapore contingent sent to earthquake-devastated Nepal to assist with relief efforts provided humanitarian relief and search-and-rescue work, while its combined medical team treated more than 3,000 injured people, said Second Minister for Foreign Affairs Masagos Zulkifli.

The Republic of Singapore Air Force, which deployed its C-130 aircraft to transport personnel, equipment and aid supplies to Nepal, also flew 11 flights into Nepal and airlifted more than 100 tonnes of relief goods into the country, he added in Parliament on Monday.

Replying to questions from Mr Ang Wei Neng (Jurong GRC) and Ms Irene Ng (Tampines GRC), Mr Masagos said that the Singapore Government also donated $250,000 through the Singapore Red Cross to help the Nepalese people.

He also thanked the officers for their hard work through the deployment, and for working tirelessly, "often under trying conditions".

Following the 7.8-magnitude quake on April 25, Singapore sent a contingent comprising personnel from agencies such as the Singapore Police Force, Singapore Civil Defence Force, Singapore Armed Forces, Ministry of Health and Health Sciences Authority. The Foreign Affairs Ministry also deployed a Crisis Response Team to Kathmandu.

The mission was the Home Team's largest ever deployment for an overseas disaster relief operation, with a total of 126 officers deployed to Nepal.
