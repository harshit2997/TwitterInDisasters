Russian rescuers have begun search-and-rescue operations in the Nepalese city of Kathmandu, Russian Emergency Situations Ministry combined unit leader Alexander Romanov said.

Russian rescuers have begun search-and-rescue operations in the Nepalese city of Kathmandu, Russian Emergency Situations Ministry combined unit leader Alexander Romanov said.

"Three teams of Russian rescuers headed for most affected city areas immediately upon their arrival," Romanov said.

Two teams are reconnoitering the area, and Tsentrospas specialists mounted on a Rosenbauer vehicle are cleaning up debris of a residential building, he said.

"We are hopeful we may still find survivors under the debris. Judging by quake cleanup experience, there is a chance to find survivors under quake debris within up to ten days," the unit leader noted.

In addition to the cleanup operations, Russian rescuers are deploying their base in direct proximity to the Russian Embassy, he said.

Ministry specialists have provided stable telephone and Internet service and established a video link with the National Crisis Management Center.
