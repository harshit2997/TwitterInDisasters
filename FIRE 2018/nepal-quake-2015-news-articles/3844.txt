Chances of more survivors being found are "limited", say officials, who called for aid in the form of dry food, water, water purifiers and blankets.

KATHMANDU, Nepal: International rescue teams have so far recovered just 13 survivors in quake-hit Nepal, and chances of more survivors being found are "limited", Nepalese officials said on Wednesday morning (Apr 29).

The Nepalese Home Affairs Ministry also urged teams to help Nepalese families recover bodies from the earthquake to help them find closure. The information was shared during a daily meeting at the Nepalese Army Headquarters with multinational rescue teams, which included China, Bangladesh, Poland, US, Malaysia, Japan and Singapore.



The officials added Nepal is urgently in need of relief items including dry food, water, water purifiers and blankets.



The ministry also said thousands of Nepalese are leaving Kathmandu for fear of food and water shortage. Some local groups are helping to transport these Nepalese out of the capital city, it added.



Channel NewsAsia saw droves of Nepalese lining along the streets - in a queue estimated to be about 2km long - waiting for transport out of Kathmandu.



Meanwhile, it urged local shops to open so that locals can start buying supplies.
