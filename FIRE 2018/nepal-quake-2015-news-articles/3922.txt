Nepal Earthquake: in pictures
</headline>

<text>
A massive earthquake measuring 7.8 on the Richter scale hit Nepal on 25th April causing devastation across 39 districts, over half of the country. More than 10,000 people are expected to have died, and some 8 million people have been affected.

ActionAid has conducted a range of rapid needs assessments and has begun distributing relief items, including food (rice, lentils, salt), tarpaulin sheets and mats to support people sleeping outdoors. Providing these most-needed supplies is an urgent priority, paid for with your donations.

The supplies are distributed by staff from ActionAid Nepal as well as partners. ActionAid has worked in Nepal for 30 years in some of the areas most affected by the disaster.

Everyone who is able is pitching in. The distributions are led by local disaster management committees and women from communities.

The challenges are great, however. Much of the infrastructure has been seriously damaged across the country. In order to rebuild, the immediate needs of the people need to be met.

Each building destroyed affects the lives of Nepalese communities, and many buildings not razed are now too unsafe to house anybody.

Accommodation is makeshift, and this is a crucial area where supplies are needed. With so many people sleeping outside, protection from the elements and personal safety needs are a priority.

Affected people need tents, food and dignity kits. Urgent needs also include psychosocial support, the establishment of safe spaces, protection of women and children from gender based violence, family reunification of separate children and clothes for women and children. ActionAid uses your donations to ensure the provision of these vital services in this time of need.
