The Ministry of Defence had earlier in the day announced that an Indian Air Force (IAF) plane carrying 291 passengers rescued from earthquake struck Nepal landed at the Palam airport this morning.

The death toll from the devastating earthquake, which hit Nepal and northern parts of India on Saturday, has reportedly climbed over 3,000 even as rescue efforts have intensified in search of the survivors.

Fresh tremors were felt across Delhi, Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, West Bengal and Assam, after an earthquake of 6.7 magnitude hit the east of Kathmandu earlier on Sunday. (ANI)
