India has stepped up relief and rescue work in neighboring Nepal on Sunday, naming the mission "Operation Maitri."

“India is moving in massive amount of rescue & relief material, equipment and specialists 2day. Shall keep you updated,” Sitanshu Kar, India’s Defense Ministry spokesman tweeted on Sunday.

Kar also said that five Indian air force helicopters were on their way to the capital Kathmandu to assist in relief work.

A day after Nepal was hit by its worst earthquake in 80 years, the death toll rose sharply on Sunday morning to 1,805, according to Nepal’s home ministry.

Thousands of local residents and tourists spent Saturday night in open spaces fearing for their life as a series of aftershocks rocked Kathmandu and nearby areas.

“All spent a really bad night here in #Kathmandu #nepal sleeping outdoors and being woken up at least once an hour by aftershocks,” Juliette Rousselot, a freelance journalist and development researcher based in Kathmandu, tweeted on Sunday morning.

There was an acute shortage of basic items like food, bottled waters and medical equipment as most shops were either damaged or remained shut because of the calamity.

“Food, water, tents for ppl using open space around Kathmandu,” Salokya, an independent blogger, wrote on Twitter to describe the immediate needs of the people of Nepal.

He also said that much of Nepal was cut off from power supply making it very difficult to get through to someone on the phone.

Sunday morning began with an aftershock in Kathmandu at 6 am local time throwing locals into tizzy.

“Jolt after jolt. Feeling so helpless,” a university student tweeted.

Dozens of relatives of missing tourists went on Twitter and Facebook seeking information about their loved ones. A large number of tourists are believed to be in Nepal because of the trekking season, Indian newspaper Hindustan Times reported on Sunday.

Evacuating stranded Indians

Kar also said that an Indian air force aircraft landed at New Delhi’s Palam airport with 237 Indians on board.

Another four helicopters had returned from Kathmandu with a total of 540 stranded Indians on board, India’s foreign ministry spokesman Vikas Swarup said on Twitter.
