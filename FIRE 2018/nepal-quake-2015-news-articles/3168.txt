ATLANTA - Some Georgia relief organizations are trying to help thousands in Nepal. Aid workers in the region are pleading for food, shelter and medicine for the millions of people who survived a massive earthquake over the weekend.



Several organizations have been gathering boxes filled with pain medicines, antibiotics, and supplies to perform surgeries and other medical procedures that will be sent to Nepal to aid the people who survived the quake.



Dr. Hugh Everhart told Channel 2’s Matt Belanger that he has been to Nepal a dozen times. But when he arrives there Tuesday, parts of the country will likely be unrecognizable to him.



"This was so catastrophic they probably will never have a body count," Everhart said about the massive loss of life already blamed on the quake. The death toll stands at more than 4,000 and is expected to rise.



Everhart will arrive with medical supplies expected to be in short supply because of a massive number of injuries.



"Just basic band aids and antibiotic ointment is going to make a big difference. It may save someone's limb," Everhart said.



Cartons of medicine donated by Georgia-based Map International will also help ease pain and prevent infection among victims.



"Just a few antibiotics may save a few lives," Everhart said.



David Canther is also bound for Nepal. He showed Belanger a back pack that holds water, which he said will be critical.



"You can wear this on your back. You can hike, you can have your water and help people," Canther said showing Belanger the back packs.



Built in chemical treatments and filters will ensure they always have safe water.



"It's only by partnering with others that you are successful," Canther said.



"Their whole lives have been turned upside down," said Dr. Helene Gayle, with Atlanta-based relief organization CARE.



They are also responding and already have 150 volunteers on the ground in Nepal.



"To save these people, to pull them from rubble and there's so much more that needs to be done," Gayle said.



This weekend’s quake is the worst earthquake to hit Nepal in 80 years and it has impacted an estimated 6.5 million people.
