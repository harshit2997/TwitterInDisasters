PASADENA >> A group of firefighters were honored by the City Council Monday after returning from relief efforts in Nepal.

Pasadena Fire Engineer Dave Marquez, Paramedic Matt Caffey, Capt. Tim Okimura and paramedic intern Derrick Bean traveled to the earthquake-stricken area recently to help with rescue and recovery efforts in villages around Nepal.

Cody Walker, brother of the late actor Paul Walker, led the team as part of the nonprofit Reach Out Worldwide.

“This is really representative about what’s best about Pasadena and the people that work here,” Pasadena Mayor Terry Tornek said as he delivered certificates of recognition to the volunteers.

Each of the firefighters had family members in attendance, who stood and applauded as the four uniformed men received their certificates.

“I wasn’t expecting a thank-you” from the council, Caffey said. “What we do as firefighters, I feel like we don’t usually expect thanks.”

Caffey was supported by his wife, daughters and parents at the meeting. The trip to Nepal was his first relief deployment, although he had traveled to Brazil as part of an outreach effort, he said.

“I’m very proud of him,” said his mom, Rebecca Caffey.

The four volunteers were part of a team of 12 that arrived in the capital city Kathmandu on April 30. The group spent four days in remote villages that had not yet received assistance, setting up clinics, food distribution centers and providing care to more than 400 people.

The team, which left locals with water filtration systems, medical supplies, tents and food, hopes to raise funds to construct an aboveground water tank in one of the villages they assisted.

“We’re very honored and proud that they work with us and serve in our community here,” Acting Deputy Fire Chief Jon Trautwein said.
