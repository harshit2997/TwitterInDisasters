Kathmandu: Two Indian-origin billionaires in United Kingdom have offered to build 1,200 quake-resistant houses in the affected villages of Nepal. Mukesh Kumar Sehgal, managing director of UK-based SISMO Company, offered 1,000 quake-resistant houses.



While, Shree Prakash Lohia, founder and chairman of Indorama Corporation offered to build 200 houses through his Lohia Foundation. Sehgal met Nepal's Ambassador to Britain, Tej Bahadur Chettri, on Friday, and offered to build 1,000 quake-resistant houses in Nepal.



"Our company is well experienced in building houses, with new technology and if, Nepal government accepts the offer, we will start construction of houses in remote areas that are severely affected," Sehgal said.



"Initially we will construct temporary houses so that affected people can be relocated. Later once debris are cleared, we will build the new settlement," Sehgal said.



Meanwhile, Nepali billionaire businessman Upendra Mahato, has announced Rs, 150 million in assistance for the relief and rehabilitation of the earthquake victims.



"30 million will be spent on immediate relief package such as tents, food stuff and clothing. Later, 120 million will be also spent for the construction of quake-resistant school buildings in the highly affected region," he said.



The number of houses destroyed in quake-hit Nepal is over 1,60,000, nearly twice the number of households wrecked in the 1934's deadly temblor, which is countryâ€™s worst disaster of all times.



At least 7,056 people have been confirmed dead from the 7.9-magnitude quake.



While the number of injured has reached 14,227, making the April 25, tremor the country's worst in over eight decades.
