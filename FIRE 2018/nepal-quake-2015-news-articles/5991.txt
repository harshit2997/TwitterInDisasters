GREENVILLE, PITT COUNTY - Dozens of students, faculty and other community members came together to remember the thousands killed by a deadly earthquake in Nepal.

They came together in song and in prayer to honor those victims. Opening their hearts and wallets to aid in relief efforts for the devastated country, home to Mount Everest.

"It takes like 10 minutes 20 minutes just to be out here supporting a country that was devastated in an earthquake if it happened to us we'd want the same kind of support," said Sandra George, an ECU freshman from Raleigh.

Some of the vigil's attendees had close ties to Nepal. Smriti Shahi, a nursing student at ECU, is from Kathmandu.

"Literally, I didn't know what to do so I picked up the phone and ended up calling my sister and after five hours I was able to talk to my sister and I was so happy to hear her voice," said Shahi.

She calls the fact that her family survived the earthquake a blessing, but she knows so many others were not so lucky.

"It's like I'm suffering with them. I cannot be in Nepal but I can feel their pain," said Shahi.

Students sold buttons to raise money for relief efforts. Organizers say all proceeds will go to Red Cross for Nepal.
