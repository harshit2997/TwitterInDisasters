Christ is the Good Shepherd, Pope emphasizes

April 27, 2015

Reflecting on the day’s Scripture readings at Mass, Pope Francis devoted his April 26 Regina Caeli address to Christ as the Good Shepherd.

“Unlike the mercenary, Christ is a caring, guiding shepherd who participates in the life of His flock, not for other interests, for He has no other ambition than to guide, nurture and protect his sheep,” the Pope said to the crowds gathered in St. Peter’s Square. “And all this at the highest price, that of the sacrifice of His own life.”

God the Father’s gift of the Good Shepherd “is the highest and purest love because it is not motivated by any necessity, is not conditioned by any calculation, and is not attracted to any interested desire to exchange,” the Pope continued

“Faced with this love of God, we experience great joy and we are open to gratitude for what we have received for free,” he added. “But it is not enough to contemplate and give thanks. One should also follow the Good Shepherd.” In particular, bishops and priests “are called not to take on the mentality of ‘manager,’ but that of the servant, in imitation of Jesus who, stripping Himself, has saved us with His mercy.”

Following the praying of the Regina Caeli, the Pontiff prayed for earthquake victims in Nepal, spoke of the beatification of Sister Marie-Élisabeth Turgeon in Canada, and greeted pilgrims who had come to Rome for the first anniversary of the canonization of St. John Paul II.
