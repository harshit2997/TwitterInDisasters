Tearful reunions as Ottawans arrive from Nepal
</headline>

After four days of living through the aftermath of the deadly earthquake that struck Nepal, members of Ottawa charity trekking group Dream Mountains Foundation have finally come home.

Seventeen of the 22 members, including Brett Starke and roommate Matt Carson, touched down at the Ottawa airport Wednesday afternoon and were greeted by hugs, tears and kisses from family and friends.

“It’s hard to talk right now because I don’t know what to say,” said Starke. “I don’t know what’s going through my mind right now. I don’t know how I feel.

“I don’t know if it’s good to be back. I feel mixed feelings. Everything’s so normal here but everything is definitely not normal (in Nepal).”

The group was in Kathmandu preparing for a hike to Everest Base Camp for their charity Saturday when the 7.8 magnitude earthquake hit.

Everyone in the group was uninjured and their hotel, the Yik & Yak, was the only building untouched by the earthquake on a street that was turned to rubble. More than 5,000 people were killed and another 10,000 injured.

Carson, who was with Starke in their room when the earthquake hit, said the experience brought the group together.

“It helped us all realize that — if we didn’t already know — all we need is each other,” said Carson.

But despite not being able to accomplish what the group set out to do, Carson was happy to be home and be greeted at the gate by his mom Connie and dad Jim.

“We’re feeling very much relieved,” said Jim. “We’re overwhelmed and emotional. And even though we knew they were alright, seeing the situation unfold (in Nepal), things could have gone downhill rapidly.”

“Being thousands of miles away you feel helpless,” added Connie. “We’re so happy he’s home. But it’s bittersweet because we know that there are still all these people that are still suffering through this tragedy. We’re very thankful.”

Now that the two men are home safe and sound, both said it’s time to unwind and reflect on what they went through — an experience they say they struggle to comprehend but will stay with them forever.

And even though they were in the middle of what is considered to be one of Nepal’s worst earthquakes in recent history, the group plans to go back to the region in 2018 and finish what they started.

The remaining five group members, including team leader Shawn Dawson, are making their way back to Ottawa. Their date and time of arrival is not yet known.
