Varanas: A special 'deepdan' and 'aarti' took place at the Dashashwamedh Ghat near Vishwanath Temple in Varanasi for the victims of the Nepal earthquake.

The 'aarti' took place on Saturday evening as a special ode for peace of the departed souls by the priests of Vishwanath Temple, where the priests offered prayers to 'Maa Ganga' and 'Baba Vishwanath'.

"We have organised a 'deepdan' for the peace of the demised victims of the earthquake that took place in Nepal today. Three 'aartis' will take place. We have also kept observed silence for their peace", said Mayansh, a priest of Nepali origin at the Vishwanath Temple.

"We have organised this special 'aarti' for all those affected in the Nepal earthquake. Prayers are being offered to Maa Ganga and Baba Vishwanath for the peace of those who have died," said the President of Ganga Seva Nidhi, Sushant Mishra.
