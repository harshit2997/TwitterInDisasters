Nepal Earthquake News: Second Earthquake within a Month Strikes Nepal Shilpa Chakravorty May 13, 2015 04:00 PM EDT

Navesh Chitrakar/ReutersThe Nepal Earthquake killed more than 2500 people even reaching other countries such as India with 66 people dead and Tibet with 18.

In Nepal, over a thousand people have been injured and several dozen killed, after the nation was stuck by a second earthquake. The strong earthquake struck, just weeks after the disaster which killed more than 8,000 people as well as destroyed thousands of homes.

According to the United States Geological Survey, the second earthquake was measured at a magnitude of 7.3, and hit 42 miles west of the town of Namche Bazaar, which is close to Mount Everest.

The earthquake was followed shortly by no less than six strong aftershocks. As far away as Dehli, the capital of India, and Dhaka, the capital of Bangladesh, the waves could be felt.

One of the worst hit areas from the earthquake which took place last month, Sindhupalchok, suffered significant damage as a result of this earthquake as well.

The local bureaucrat with the highest level of seniority, Krishna Gyawali, said that eight people had been killed in the district and more than 100 people were injured.

Since the disaster, there have been conflicting figures coming from officials, in terms of the number of casualties.

Numbers are still coming from remote rural areas which appear to have had the highest amount of devastation. According to Nepal's home ministry, at least 42 people were killed and 1,117 people injured in the last earthquake.

The amount of deaths and injuries are expected to rise because dozens of houses have collapsed, likely crushing their inhabitants who are yet to been discovered.

According to witnesses, the damage in Sindhupalchok is widespread, including roads having been cut by high stones and cracked.

Dozens of helicopters from India, China and the US are based in Nepal since the earthquake last month, so thankfully, relief efforts were started immediately.
