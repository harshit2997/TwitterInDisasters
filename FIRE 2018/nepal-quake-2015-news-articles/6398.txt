KENMORE, N.Y. (WIVB)- A second earthquake has hit Nepal, two weeks after an earthquake left the country devastated.

We first talked to Kenmore resident Bishnu Kapri after the first earthquake happened. He told News 4 anything left standing from that last disaster has been destroyed.

“A lot of houses that weren’t collapsed…leaning sideways, just cracked, this one just helped to put it down on the ground,” said Kapri.

He told News 4 his family in Nepal is safe but this second disaster is creating deep fear at home and abroad.

“I worry [that] I woke up one day and there’s no family members, ya know what I’m saying? I’m afraid I’m losing my family members,” he said.

At least five people in his village have died. Despite his loss, Kapri said there is hope, drawing on words from his cousin.

“He says he’s going back to the village to help the people in the village, ‘This is our bonus life, our second life so we have to enjoy it, help the people in need’,” said Kapri, quoting his cousin.

Kapri sent about $2,000 to Nepal to buy 15-20 pound bags of rice to help feed his village. He told us about 15 of those bags were distributed to each of the nine districts in his village.

Meanwhile, the Nepali Student Association at Buffalo State has raised about $1,000 to help feed more than a hundred people.

“This money is to build their hope so people can build the buildings,” said Som Dhital, the organization’s president.

Dhital said more needs to be done to help the millions of people devastated by the earthquakes.

“It’s really bad, I mean people are dying and the government and other people are just watching it, they are waiting for someone to help,” he said.

Dhital told us even though his immediate family is no longer in the country, he considers all Nepali people his family.

The organization is collecting money until Friday to send to the Red Cross. They are also holding a candlelight vigil at the Campbell Student Union from 5:00-8:00 p.m. on Sunday
