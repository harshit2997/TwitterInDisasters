JOHANNESBURG - Hopes of finding survivors in earthquake-stricken Nepal is fading fast.

The 7.8 magnitude earthquake shook the Himalayan country on Saturday.

The death toll -- standing at 3,600 -- is expected to rise as rescue teams try to reach rural areas over the next few days.

South African aid organisation Gift of the Givers is planning a rescue trip to Nepal.

They will most likely be chartering their own flight with rescue workers, specialised equipment and supplies worth R5-million.

The flight wil serve dual purpose. All SAfricans caught up in Nepal r welcome 2 utilise the private aircraft 2 return home. #NepalEarthquake — Gift of the Givers (@GiftoftheGivers) April 26, 2015

“We’re planning on going to those remote areas teams have not yet been able to reach.

"Looking at reports from Nepal at the moment, some areas are totally unaccessible and can only be reached by helicopters and joining other teams,” said Ahmed Bham of Gift of the Givers.

“A lot of other search and rescue teams are moving in so we’ll join them and try to reach those villages.”

The Gift of the Givers team is planning to take the following resources and equipment.

1. Human resources included on the trip:

- 20 trauma specialists including general, orthopaedic and maxillo facial surgeons with anaesthetists, emergency medicine intensivists, theatre and ICU nurses, paramedics and orthopaedic assistants

- 20 highly qualified search and rescue personnel

2. Some of the equipment that will be taken on the trip:

- Life Locator, (a machine that can accurately predict the presence of life 10 metres below the rubble in 3 minutes)

- Search cam, (a camera facility that provides video footage as the team search through rubble)

Those who want to contribute to the efforts can deposit money into Gift of the Givers' bank account.

The details are: Standard Bank, Pietermaritzburg Branch.

Account No. 0522-786-11, Branch code 057525
