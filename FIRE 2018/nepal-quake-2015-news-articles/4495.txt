Stamford-based AmeriCares airlifted 14 tons of emergency medical aid to Nepal on Tuesday.

The supplies are meant to help the country that was devastated by an earthquake last month.

A flight carrying $1 million worth of antibiotics, pain relievers, bandages and IV fluids is expected to help thousands of adults and children who were hurt in the earthquake.

Just last week, hundreds around Connecticut helped support the “Connecticut Cares- A 3 Cares Event” for Nepal and generously donated nearly $20,000 to help with the relief efforts.
