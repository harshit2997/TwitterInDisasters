EUGENE, Ore. - Jennifer Brazil said she got a call from Amber's dad at 4 a.m. Tuesday morning.



Amber said they were fine well, and they weren't harmed at all. They'd been walking quite a ways and their goal is to get to the airport to hurry up and get home.



"I knew she was fine. I just felt in my heart she was fine," Jennifer said, "but until you hear somebody say she's fine, there's just so many awful things that we're hearing about people and the more time that was going by and we weren't hearing anything, that was kind of scary."

Earlier report

EUGENE, Ore. - A University of Oregon student trekking with a friend in Nepal is on the list of U.S. citizens missing in the wake of the devastating earthquake there.



Oregon student Amber Brazil completed an internship in Thailand before meeting up with friend Alicia Scroggins in Nepal.



The two were on a 7-day guided tour through Langtang National Park in the Himalayas. They are due in Kathmandu on Tuesday.



"I am all over the place," said Brazil's mother, Jennifer. "I feel like she's OK, my gut tells me she's OK, but then I waffle back to - I don't know what I'd do in a world without her."
