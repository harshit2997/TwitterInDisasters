Lions Club donates to Nepal’s quake survivors

08-May-2015

The Lions Club has donated R25,000 which will go towards alleviating the suffering of survivors of the recent devastating earthquake in Nepal.



It was during a short ceremony at the headquarters of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs on Wednesday afternoon that Lions Club of Seychelles vice-chairperson Ramu Pillay handed over the cheque to Foreign Affairs and Transport Minister Joël Morgan.



This was in the presence of Lions Club former president Siva Pillay and some Nepalese working here.



Mr Pillay said the Lions Club will continue to provide help to those in need.



“We at Lions Club of Seychelles felt sad when we heard about the major disaster that happened in Nepal, so we decided to help the Nepalese people and government by making a small donation…We shall continuously support the people of Nepal in the future,” said Mr Pillay.



Thanking the Lions Club of Seychelles for this kind gesture Minister Morgan, quoting a recent statement made by Vice-President Danny Faure, said: “We can all be contributors”. He added that this is a time for renewed solidarity and we hope this donation will contribute to help quake-stricken families in Nepal.



Minister Morgan noted that it was with profound sorrow that we learned about the catastrophic earthquake which struck Nepal and it is even with deeper sadness that through different media we continue to learn about the increasing loss of lives and property and see the extent of the destruction and suffering.



“We are happy that despite its size, an organisation from Seychelles is finding a way to contribute to the international help Nepal requires,” Minister Morgan added.



Seychelles and Nepal established diplomatic relations on October 10, 1986 and over the past few years the Seychelles government has been employing Nepalese security personnel to work in the police force and at the prisons.



For his part, Mr Pillay said the Lions Club will continue to provide help to those in need when and how it can.
