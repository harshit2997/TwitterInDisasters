CHENNAI: To help the victims of quake-hit Nepal, Madras Sterling Round Table 123 and Chennai Mission Trust have launched an initiative 'Milk for Nepal' to send around 40 tonnes of milk to the Himalayan kingdom.Prices of daily essentials, including milk, have sky rocketed after the devastating earthquake jolted Nepal on April 25. "We are raising funds to source over 40 tonnes of milk powder at highly subsidised rates. Private mil supplier Arokya has come forward and donated 10 tonnes of milk powder towards this cause," said M Mahadevan, founder of Chennai Mission Trust."Milk powder can be easily transported and has a larger shelf life.Inland Roadways has come forward to transport the milk powder to Nepal free of cost," said Akshay Dugar, chairman of Madras Sterling Round Table 123. The distribution of milk powder in Nepal will be undertaken by Madras Sterling Round Table's Nepal-based sister organisation.'Milk for Nepal' accepts a minimum contribution of 500. This would sponsor a glass of milk for one child for three months.Those willing to support this cause can make donation at collection points located across the city. Donations can also be made by logging on to milkfornepal.com.
