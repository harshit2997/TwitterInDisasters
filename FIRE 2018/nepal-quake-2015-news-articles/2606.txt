United States Ambassador Richard Rahul Verma on Tuesday said that India has demonstrated its global leadership through its rescue and relief efforts in earthquake-hit Nepal.

Verma, who took to twitter to voice his opinion, noted that this followed the evacuation of over 5,600 people from crisis-hit Yemen earlier this month.

"India has demonstrated its global leadership in recent weeks, 1st in Yemen and now in Nepal. We're grateful; We're impressed; We're inspired," he tweeted.

Saturday's earthquake, which measured 7.9 on the Richter scale, resulted in the deaths of over 5,000 people and was one of the worst calamities suffered by Nepal in over 80 years.

India has evacuated 170 foreign nationals hailing from 15 countries from Nepal, which recently witnessed a devastating earthquake resulting in the death of over 5,000 people.

The people evacuated include 71 Spaniards, 33 Polish, 20 Czech, 10 US and eight German nationals.
