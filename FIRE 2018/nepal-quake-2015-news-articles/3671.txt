Nepal's luxury hotel refuses to offer rooms to quake-hit homeless

A luxury hotel in Kathmandu has been accused of letting only wealthy visitors inside its premises while refusing to help desperate homeless in the wake of the devastating quake.

Thousands of people have become homeless following the 7.8-magnitude quake in the Himalayan state, which has also claimed the lives of over 5,000 people.

Citing mountain guide Ang Tshering Lama, Mail Online reported that the five-star Hyatt Regency, spread across 37 acres of land, is not letting desperate quake hit people inside.

According to the report, Lama took a series of pictures that showed people in makeshift camps on roadsides outside the complex.

In a Facebook post, Lama urged people to boycott the hotel.

Hyatt, a US-based company runs nearly two dozen hotels in different parts of the globe including America, Mumbai, Tokyo, Kathmandu and Seoul.

Meanwhile, the hotel managers have denied the allegation. Vice president of the company Brigitta Witt said in a statement on its official website that it is working with MercyCorps as part of its relief efforts.

"We know Nepal has a long rebuilding process ahead, and we want to do what we can to support our colleagues, neighbours and the community in Kathmandu during this difficult time," she was quoted as saying.

The toll in the devastating earthquake in Nepal rose to 5000 on Wednesday morning, as Prime Minister Sushil Koirala warned it could go as high as 10,000. While still battling food and water shortages, the Himalayan nation announced three days of mourning from Wednesday.

With many of the thousands injured in critical condition and hundreds still missing, the fatalities from Saturday's 7.9 magnitude temblor could soar up to 10,000, Koirala told the envoys of India, China and the US.
