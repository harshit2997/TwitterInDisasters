China will provide a second batch of humanitarian aid worth 40 million yuan (6.54 million U.S. dollars) to Nepal following Saturday's earthquake, the Ministry of Commerce (MOC) said on Wednesday.[Special coverage]

The aid, including water purification equipment, first aid kits, tents and blankets, will be delivered to Nepal as soon as possible, the ministry said in a statement.

A massive 8.1-magnitude quake shook Nepal on Saturday. The Chinese government announced its first batch of aid on Sunday.

The MOC on Wednesday also announced joint efforts with the Ministry of Finance to put meat normally held by the government in reserve on food security grounds into markets in Tibet, the Nepal-bordering Chinese region that was also affected by the quake.

The supplies, intended to help meet local needs following the quake, will include 100 tonnes of yak meat and 100 tonnes of pork.
