New Delhi, Apr 27 : The Ministry of Defence on Monday announced that an Indian Air Force (IAF) plane carrying 291 passengers rescued from earthquake struck Nepal landed at the Palam airport this morning. “#NepalEarthquake One C-17 of IAF landed at Palam from Kathmandu with 291 passengers on board at 0630 this morning,” official spokesperson of the Ministry of Defence (MoD), Sitanshu Kar, said on twitter.

He added that while feeble tremors continue to rock Nepal on the third day, one Rapid Action Medical Team (RATM) of IAF is ready with their medicines and equipment to set up first aid centre in Lagankhel, eight kilometres from the airport in Kathmandu. “#NepalEarthquake RATM is Rapid Action Medical Team. Army teams to bring in persons who need assistance to the centre…3 doctors and 25 paramedics to man the centre,” Kar said in a series of tweets.

The MoD spokesperson further said that the IAF would try to complete five aborted sorties which could not be done yesterday due to aftershocks, plus seven more. “#NepalEarthquake As of Now: IAF has evacuated 1935 passengers from Kathmandu utilising 12 aircraft sorties,” he added. Meanwhile, the Ministry of External Affairs has said that since April 25, a total of 1,935 Indians have been evacuated to India via IAF aircrafts.

“#NepalEarthquake Since 25 April a total of 1935 Indians have been evacuated to India via IAF aircrafts. More flights are expected today,” MEA official spokesperson Vikas Swarup tweeted. He also shared the numbers of the 24-hour Control Room for queries regarding the earthquake. The numbers are +91 11 2301 2113, +91 11 2301 4104, +91 11 2301 7905.

The death toll from the devastating earthquake, which hit Nepal and northern parts of India on Saturday, has reportedly climbed over 3,000 even as rescue efforts have intensified in search of the survivors. Fresh tremors were felt across Delhi, Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, West Bengal and Assam, after an earthquake of 6.7 magnitude hit the east of Kathmandu earlier on Sunday.
