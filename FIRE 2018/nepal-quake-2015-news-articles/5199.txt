May 8, 2015 - Ottawa, Ontario - Foreign Affairs, Trade and Development Canada

The Honourable Christian Paradis, Minister of International Development and La Francophonie, today announced the shipment of emergency relief supplies to Nepal to help meet the immediate needs of people affected by the earthquake.

Since the beginning of the week, Canada, through its Strategic Partnership with the Canadian Red Cross, has shipped the following supplies to Nepal from Foreign Affairs, Trade and Development Canada’s emergency stockpiles in Mississauga, Ontario, and Dubai, United Arab Emirates, to assist the people of Nepal in the hardest-hit regions:

14,900 blankets

6,500 mosquito nets

6,420 jerry cans

5,960 tarpaulins

2,980 hygiene parcels

2,980 kitchen sets

2,000 shelter kits

1,980 buckets

798 tents

The Government of Canada has deployed the supplies to support the relief efforts of the Nepal Red Cross Society, CARE Canada, Save the Children and World Vision Canada, which will distribute the much-needed items to earthquake-affected families.

Additional supplies from DFATD’s stockpile in Dubai are also being arranged, and will be sent to Nepal in the next few days.

The Government of Canada remains committed to working with the Government of Nepal and the international community to assist the Nepalese people in their time of need. In addition to the efforts made by our government, Canadian citizens have shown their compassion, their commitment to being global citizens, and their solidarity with the Nepalese people. To encourage these efforts, the Nepal Earthquake Relief Fund was established, whereby for every eligible dollar donated by individual Canadians to registered Canadian charities in response to the earthquake between April 25 and May 25, 2015, the Government of Canada will set aside one dollar for the fund.
