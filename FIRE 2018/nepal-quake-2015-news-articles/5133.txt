A group of medical workers from southwest China's Tibet Autonomous Region has arrived in neighboring Nepal to help prevent disease outbreaks in border areas following a catastrophic earthquake that claimed over 7,000 lives.[Special coverage]

At the request of the Nepalese government, 30 professionals from Tibet's regional health and family planning commission and disease control center entered Nepal via Zham Port around 11 a.m. on Monday, said Wang Hai, head of the medical team.

While there have been no epidemics in quake-hit Tibetan areas, the Nepalese side of the border faces serious disease prevention challenges, according to Wang.

"If the bodies of victims and dead animals are not dealt with in time, they are very likely to pollute water and soil and cause outbreaks of communicable diseases," he said.

Wang said they would disinfect and bury the bodies, sterilize water sources and eliminate mosquitos.

He noted that the job would be carried out in line with locals' religious beliefs and customs.

On Wednesday, a 59-member Chinese medical team arrived in Kathmandu. As of Friday, they had completed epidemic prevention measures for two camps, 59 tents, 30 garbage dumps and nine collapsed sites.
