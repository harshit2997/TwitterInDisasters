Kathmandu: The death toll after a magnitude-7.8 earthquake hit Nepal on Saturday has risen to 1800 and many more are injured.

The massive quake damaged several buildings and centuries-old temples. The hospitals in Nepal's capital Kathmandu were soon overcrowded forcing the health officials to treat the injured outside in the open.

The quake shook a wide swath of northern India, Bangladesh, Tibet and Pakistan. At least 10 people died on Mount Everest as the quake triggered avalanches in the Himalayas.

According to Nepal police, at least 1,865 people were killed and it is feared that the death toll would rise as many people are still believed to be trapped under debris. Nepal Home Affairs Ministry said 29 districts were designated as crisis zones during an emergency Cabinet meeting later Saturday.

Helps poured in from different countries across the world with India leading the way. The US and the EU are also sending disaster response teams. "We are using all our resources for rescue and to help the displaced," Rameshwor Dangal, who heads Nepal's Himalayan nation's National Disaster Management Division, said.

Chinese state media reported that 17 people had died in Tibet due to quake. In Nepal, the cell phone network was badly damaged and large parts of Kathmandu were plunged into darkness. Local media reported that tremors were felt in Kathmandu throughout the night. The quake leveled hundreds of buildings, including office blocks and a historic nine-storey tower.

The trouble for quake-affected people in Kathmandu is set to increase as weather forecasters warned on Saturday that the capital is set to receive heavy rain.

The Red Cross (IFRC) has expressed serious concern over the fate of villages which are situated close to the epicentre of the quake northwest of Kathmandu. "Roads have been damaged or blocked by landslides and communication lines are down preventing us from reaching local Red Cross branches to get accurate information," said IFRC Asia Pacific director Jagan Chapagain.
