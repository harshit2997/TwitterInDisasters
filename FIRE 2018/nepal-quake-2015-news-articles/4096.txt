BANGKOK, 29 April 2015 â€“ Defense Minister General Prawit Wongsuwan has instructed the armed forces to increase their relief efforts for quake survivors in Nepal.

General Prawit said the Royal Thai Armed Forces are currently in the process prioritizing donations. Donations are expected to transit through India before being transported to Nepal.

He said that a large amount of donated items have prompted the authorities to consider sea transport, due to the logistics cost of airlifting them.

The Royal Thai Navy has been instructed to decide whether a commercial ship should be contracted to deliver the donations.
