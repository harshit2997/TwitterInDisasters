Children that survived a typhoon in the Philippines in 2013 have sent a message of hope to Nepal.

A second quake hit Nepal on Tuesday, two weeks after a massive earthquake devastated the country and rescue work is continuing to find survivors.

The kids in the video were affected by a natural disaster when Typhoon Haiyan, one of the most powerful typhoons ever recorded, tore into the Philippines in south-east Asia in November 2013.

It left some parts of the country completely flattened. Over 6,000 people died and millions were left homeless.
