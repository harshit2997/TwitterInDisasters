Connecticut's Nepalese Respond To Devastation In Homeland
</headline>

<text>
WEST HARTFORD â€” Connecticut's Nepalese community, many of whom live in West Hartford, have been working to obtain information about loved ones and friends in Nepal, which was devastated by an earthquake Saturday.

Ghanashyam Khadka, president of the Nepalese Association of Connecticut, said his organization's members are trying with limited success to get information. Power lines are down and the internet is jammed, making it difficult to get information, Khadka said.

Still, he said, one member of his organization has already learned that his mother died in a building collapse caused by the earthquake.

"In Katmandu most of the ancient buildings and ancient monuments are devastated," Khadka said. "Most of the big houses, the multi-story houses have fallen down. Lots of people are trapped."

In addition to finding out about friends and loved ones, the local Nepalese community will raise money to assist families affected by the devastation.

"A lot of people's families have losses over there," Khadka said. "We are still finding those families."

The organization's members are trying to get information from people in areas not as badly affected by the earthquake or from relief organizations providing assistance.

And some members of Connecticut's Nepalese community will gather Saturday afternoon to discuss how to assist.

"We are talking about how to collect financial help for them," Khadka said.

Stamford-based AmeriCares has sent a response team and is preparing to send medical and relief supplies it has stockpiled in Mumbai, India.

"Our emergency response team is en route to Nepal and we are prepared to help any way that we can," AmeriCares President and CEO Michael J. Nyenhuis said. "This is a terrible tragedy and our hearts go out to the families suffering."
