How to help Nepal's earthquake victims and survivors
</headline>

<text>
Thousands are dead and the full scope of the damage related to a 7.8 magnitude earthquake in Nepal this weekend is still setting in.

On Monday evening, Mercy Corps will hold a candlelight vigil outside its downtown Portland headquarters where donations will be accepted.

The Portland-based relief agency has more than 90 staffers on the ground in Nepal and more reinforcements on the way.

Mercy Corps began releasing kits with water, clothing and cooking utensils in the remote mountain nation for survivors. The relief agency is also distributing thousands of shelter kits, tarps and household supplies.

It's easy to donate at Mercy Corps' website, with a banner across the middle of the front page drawing attention to the need for food, water and shelter.

Donations collected at the vigil and made online will go to recovery efforts.

Portland Mayor Charlie Hales issues a brief release Monday including a comprehensive list of agencies that donate to the relief effort. "Our hearts and prayers are with the people of Nepal, following the devastating earthquake there. To our own Nepali Portlander community: please know that the world will rally to assist your country in its time of need," Hales said.

Mercy Corps is located at 28 S.W. 1st Ave., in downtown Portland.
