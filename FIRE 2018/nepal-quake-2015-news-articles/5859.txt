MORE than 100 Australians were flown out of the earthquake disaster zone in Nepal as the death toll and donations to help continued rising on Friday.

The first Royal Australian Air Force flight arrived in Bangkok on Friday morning with 106 Australian and other foreign nationals on board from Kathmandu.

Many more Australians were still stranded in the disaster-ridden nation, including in Lukla, a common base for tourists looking to trek to Mount Everest Base Camp.

They were among thousands of Nepalese left without homes after the earthquake and the United Nations has confirmed more than 5800 have died since the disaster.

The flight delivered some 15 tonnes of aid to help with the recovery, including shelters, sanitary supplies and water purification kits.

More flights to evacuate Australians and others to Bangkok for commercial flights home were expected in coming days as people returned to Kathmandu from Lukla and other remote villages.

On Thursday Foreign Minister Julie Bishop confirmed that most of the hundreds of Australians who were in Nepal when the earthquake hit had been located.

Appeals for cash donations continue, with Oxfam on Friday reporting more than $11 million had been raised so far, $2 million of which came from Australian donors.

Other groups have reported hundreds of thousands in local donations to the relief effort, including about $230,000 of the $350,000 the UNHCR hopes to raise.

But recovery efforts and the distribution of aid have been hampered by the destruction caused by last Saturday's earthquake and the remote and mountainous Nepalese country.
