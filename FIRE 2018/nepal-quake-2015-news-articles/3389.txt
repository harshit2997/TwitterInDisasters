ASIA/NEPAL - Jesuits and Salesians engaged in disaster relief and assistance
</headline>

<text>
Kathmandu - On Saturday, April 25, a massive earthquake struck Nepal. The epicenter of the quake was approximately halfway between Kathmandu and the town of Pokhara in central Nepal. Deaths and destruction have been reported from as far away as Tibet, Bangladesh, north India and Bhutan, but the major damage has been in Nepal. Fr. Borniface Tigga, Regional Superior of the Jesuits of Nepal reports that the 68 Jesuits of Nepal, along with other religious communities and the Vicariate of Nepal, are fortunate in that they have not suffered any loss of life or serious injury. There has been some damage to buildings at some religious institutions. "When the risk of after-shocks has passed we will assess the situation more closely, in order to assure the safety of those we teach and serve", said Fr. Tigga in the note sent to Fides by the Curia of the Jesuits.

"Local communities and all those who have not been affected by the earthquake are engaged in rescue operations - continued Fr. Tigga. Nepal Jesuit Society has responded quickly to this terrible tragedy. St. Xavierâ€™s College has reached out to two remote villages in Dhading district providing the villagers with tarpaulin sheets to sleep under and basic food material. There is another relief material distribution under way in Kavre district. Many roads are blocked and so it is hard to reach by road in many places".

Even the Salesians and the Daughters of Mary Help of Christians present in Nepal are all fine, as Ans informs, and although affected by the shock and fear, they are committed to working together in order to face the emergency.

The Salesians have been in Nepal since the 90s, and work in Kathmandu, in the suburb of Lubhu. The Daughters of Mary Help of Christians opened their home in Kathmandu in 2007.
