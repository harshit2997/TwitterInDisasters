Over 100 mountaineers including dozens of foreign nationals have been rescued in the frozen lake region of Langtang National Park in Nepal following the devastating earthquake, an official said on Wednesday.[Special coverage]

"Around 100 foreigners stranded in the area have been taken to Dhunche and we are arranging to airlift them to Kathmandu," Uaddhav Bhattarai, chief officer of Rasuwa District, told Xinhua.

Dhunche, the headquarters of Rasuwa District, is 45.5 km away from capital city Kathmandu. Rasuwa is a district near Nepal's border with China.

"We are yet to identify the nationalities of those rescued and stranded mountaineers," Bhattarai added.

Meanwhile, Director General of the Nepal's Tourism Department Tulsi Prasad Gautam told Xinhua that "all the stranded mountaineers in the Langtang National Park will be airlifted to Kathmandu as early as possible."

Earlier on Tuesday, 21 Israeli climbers were rescued from the Langtang area, said the Nepali Home Ministry Spokesperson Laxmi Prasad Dhakal.

Langtang National Park was established in 1976 as the first Himalayan national park. The park has been one of the popular destinations among foreigners for trekking.
