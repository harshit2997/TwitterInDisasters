Bungie’s Nepal Earthquake Relief T-Shirts Also Come With In-Game Loot
</headline>

<text>
As you may be aware, a 7.8 magnitude earthquake struck the country of Nepal on April 25. Bungie has decided to enlist the aid of Destiny fans in raising money to support relief efforts.

Now through May 24, the company is taking orders for a limited edition Nepal Aid t-shirt. The entirety of the profits from the $24.99 purchase price will be donated to charities involved in providing aid to those in need.

Bungie is offering a bit of in-game incentive, too. For each shirt purchased, Bungie will send a redemption code for an in-game shader and emblem.

These will be delivered later in the year after a game update. The shirts will be shipped in early June.

Shirts are available in men’s, women’s, and youth styles. You can purchase them on the Bungie store.

Note: This story originally incorrectly indicated that the entire purchase price would be contributed to charity. All profits from the shirt sales will be donated. The error has been fixed.

Our Take

Gamers have proven time and again that we are compassionate and charitable people. Whether you are a Destiny fan or simply want to to help those in need, this vehicle (or a direct donation to a recognized charity) can go a long way.
