Though the historical “Sat Tale Durbar” (seven-storey palace) in Nuwakot suffered minor damages due to the April 25 earthquake, other surrounding buildings like Rangamahal and Garadghar have been completely destroyed.

Located atop a hill overlooking Samari, Dhikure and Thansing valleys with a view of Tadi and Trishuli rivers, the palace was constructed by King Prithvi Narayan Shah and used it as the administrative headquarters after annexing Nuwakot in 1744 BS.

Taleju Bhagwati temple located around 200 metres north from the palace has also been ravaged by the quake. Locals were preparing to enlist the area famous for its historical significance as a world heritage site. The Palace, originally nine-storey tall, had come down to seven storeys following 1934 earthquake.

The recent quake, meanwhile, damaged its west and south sides of the second and third storeys and its pillars have developed cracks and the roof has been unhinged.

Likewise, the 400-year-old Bhairabi temple has tilted slightly. Following the damage, religious ceremonies or daily prayers have come to a halt.

According to Nuwakot Heritage Forum Chairperson Pushkar Rimal, they were planning to conserve the heritage site with a budget of around Rs 6 million. The palace had recently been turned into a museum.

The Gorkha Durbar, a historical palace of Shah kings, has been damaged by the April 25 quake. An abode of kings from Ram Shah to Prithvi Narayan Shah, the palace was a witness to the unification of the present day Nepal.

The quake has damaged the throne of Prithvi Narayan Shah and steeple of the Gorakhnath temple. The recently installed statue of King Prithvi Narayan Shah, however, remains intact.

“As it is way too risky to conduct any religious rituals inside the temple, devotees return from a safe distance,” said priest Pradip Yogi.

Only a few people are seen visiting the area to observe the damage.

“Although the quake destroyed the palace, it’s our responsibility to conserve this historical and cultural site,” Yogi said.

Meanwhile, Shiva Lal Chalise of Nepal Engineers’ Association said they should work towards restoration of the damaged structure from the ground up. As the building is not safe for entrance, even police and Nepal Army personnel deployed for palace security are living in camps outside the palace premises.
