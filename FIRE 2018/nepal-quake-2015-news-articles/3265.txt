Dozens of Britons missing as Nepal death toll rises





The death toll from the earthquake in Nepal has risen to 4,310, with almost 8,000 injured, according to official reports.





Around 40 Britons are registered as missing, but the UK Foreign Office said it has not received news of any British deaths.





Appealing for international aid, the country's Prime Minister Sushil Koirala warned the death toll could reach 10,000.





UN officials say eight million people have been affected across 39 districts as Nepal and the surrounding areas continue to experience aftershocks.





In the capital Kathmandu thousands of people have spent three nights sleeping outside, too afraid to return to their homes.





Water, food and electricity are in short supply and there are fears of outbreaks of disease and hospitals say they are unable to cope with the number of people in need of medical care.





The deadly earthquake triggered avalanches that killed 18 people on Mount Everest and trapped more than 200, although 60 were rescued by helicopter yesterday and the injured have now been evacuated, say reports. A total of 42 teams were attempting to scale Mount Everest at the time.





The Foreign Office is advising against all but essential travel to Nepal and tour operators have cancelled or suspended programmes for the time being.





UK nationals already in Nepal who wish to contact the FCO should complete a form on its website , email [email protected], call on +44 207 008 0000 or text NEPAL to +44 7860010026.
