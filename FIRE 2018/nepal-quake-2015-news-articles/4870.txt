More than 100 Defense Department personnel are on the ground in Nepal helping the country recover from a massive earthquake last week that left more than 7,000 people dead.

Col. Steve Warren, Pentagon spokesman, said there are 121 Defense Department employees in Nepal, as well as a logistics support from U-Tapao in Thailand and Okinawa, Japan.

“We are working closely with host nations to minimize the impact of these activities on local populations,” he said.

In addition, five U.S. aircraft — four Ospreys and one Huey, began arriving in Nepal on Sunday morning and will stay in the country to help reach areas that are otherwise inaccessible because of damage.

“These aircraft will help emergency responders to access to remote areas which are home to many of the earthquake’s poorest and most vulnerable,” he said.
