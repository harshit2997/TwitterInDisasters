RI sends all-civilian team to Nepal

<text>
The National Disaster Mitigation Agency (BNPB) is sending a second, all-civilian relief team to Nepal without a military component.

The decision to send an all-civilian team was made after being questioned by the Nepali authorities, who were confused about the nature of the Indonesian team, leader of the second relief team Eko Budiman from BNPB said on Wednesday.

Indonesia's first relief team was a civilian one, led by the BNPB, but included medical personnel from the military.

The shift slashed the number of team members from 70 to 31, with two team members having already left for Nepal as an advance team.

Eko said that the second batch included medical personnel from various government institutions as well as other organizations such as the Indonesian Pediatrics Association (IDAI), Muhammadiyah Disaster Management Center (MDMC), Community Caring Justice Post (PKPU) and the Baptist Nusantara Volunteers (Rebana).

Eko said the relief works would still be focused in Nepal's Satungal area, a densely populated area that suffered widespread damage from the 7.4 in Richter scale earthquake. The focus in the Satungal area is based on coordination between BNPB and the Nepali government.

Upon arriving in Nepal, the second batch will coordinate its works with Indonesia's first batch of relief workers. (nvn)
