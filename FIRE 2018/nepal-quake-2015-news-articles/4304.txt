THE family and friends of Brad Robson believe the avid rock climber and co-director of Place Graceville, is safe after being caught up in the havoc of Nepal’s earthquake.

Mr Robson planned to climb Ama Dablam, a 6858m peak in the Khumbu region, on May 6.

Brisbane-based mountain climber, Michael Groom was leading the team of 10 people.

While the New Zealand-born rock climber is believed to be safe, his parents Marea and Quentin Robson were concerned about him in the days after the 7.8-magnitude quake hit Nepal.

“We’d be lying if we didn’t say we were worried but we hope everything will be OK,” Mrs Robson of Karana Downs said.

“As yet, we have had no direct confirmation from Brad.

“Everything we’ve heard has come third hand from an accompanying partner of one of the climbers on the expedition.”

Mrs Robson said her 32-year-old son was also believed to be continuing with his climb, although this had not confirmed.

“He is about 15km from Mt Everest so he could be totally oblivious to what has happened,” she said.

Place Graceville co-director Peter May, who leads the real estate team with Mr Robson, said he and his colleagues were also worried about the him.

But the amount of messages he had received from clients was phenomenal.

“We know Brad is very experienced but we were massively worried about him, especially after seeing the fates of the people who were wiped out by the avalanche,” Mr May said.

While Mr Robson’s first love is rock climbing — a passion which has seen him travel to Indonesia and Thailand — Mr May said he had also travelled to Everest Base Camp in 2011.

This camp was flattened by an avalanche triggered by the weekend’s earthquake, which has now killed more than 5000 people in Nepal.

Mrs Robson said whether or not her son returned to Nepal in the future, she was confident he would keep on climbing.

“He began rock climbing at least 10 years ago,” she said

“He just loves climbing, it’s something he really enjoys.”
