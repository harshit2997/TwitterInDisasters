Nepal Earthquakes: Experts Say Bigger Earthquakes Can Come to Nepal
</headline>

<text>
Earthquake experts say Nepal could face larger and more deadly earthquakes after the magnitude- 7.8 quake killed more than 4,000 people on Saturday.

"The earthquakes in this region can be much, much larger," said Walter Szeliga, a geophysicist at Central Washington University, reports Yahoo! News.

There is about 33 to 50 feet of pressure in the region near Kathmandu that needs to be released. During the quake on April 25, the earth jumped 10 feet.

"It has been a long time since the last big rupture, so this is not unexpected," said Marin Clark, a geophysicist at the University of Michigan.

Back in 1934, Nepal suffered a magnitude 8.2 earthquake killing more than 8,500 people in Kathmandu. Before then, an earthquake in the same place wiped out 30 percent of the population.

According to earthquake experts, Nepal is one of the world's most earthquake-prone locations because it lies at the head-on collision between two tectonic plates.

The death toll in Nepal rose above 5,200, CNN reports. People are living in tents for fear of aftershock and some have lost their homes. Half a million tents are needed.

"Life is returning to normal, but it will be some time to be completely normal," Minendra Rijal, Nepal's minister of information and communications said. "We have still not been able to properly manage to provide relief."

There is no exact number on how many people were made homeless from the earthquake but the United States announced that the earthquake affected 8 million people throughout 39 districts.

"The lives of so many children have been torn apart and they are in desperate need of life-saving support, including clean water, shelter and sanitation," said Tomoo Hozumi, the agency's Nepal representative.

Since the earthquake, rain has intensified making it harder for people who are sleeping outside after losing their homes to the quake.

More tents and aid is supposed to arrive from India and Thailand.
