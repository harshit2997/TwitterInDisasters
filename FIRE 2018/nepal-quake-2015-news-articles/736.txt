Ottawa family waiting to hear from Nepal trekker
</headline>

Faye Kennedy’s family hasn’t heard from her in more than a week.

That ordinarily wouldn’t trouble them. But since she’s trekking in the Langtang National Park area of Nepal, their concern is growing.

A 7.8 earthquake shook the region on Saturday and Kennedy’s family has yet to have any updates on the 32-year-old.

“It’s a difficult situation,” said Justin Piche, Kennedy’s brother-in-law. “We’re hoping for the best.”

Kennedy left Ottawa early in April, Piche said, but didn’t reach Kathmandu, Nepal, until April 20. That was the last time her family heard from her.

And because of her remote location in Langtang National Park, which is about 65 km north of Kathmandu, the family didn’t expect to hear from Kennedy again until May 2 just before she flew to her next destination in Tibet.

But since news of the earthquake broke, her family has been doing everything they can to try and locate her.

“We’re assuming she’s still at the National Park,” said Piche. “But we were told by the travel company she was dealing with that there is only one helicopter in the area tracking people down. And unless she was one of the first airlifted back to Kathmandu, she’s likely still there.”

The area is known for it’s rainy weather, said Piche. So if Kennedy is safe, they are worried about shelter for her since she relied on travel houses along the way — most of which have been reduced to rubble from the earthquake.

“Given the damage that’s been done and the fact that she’s in a rural area we could be waiting for quite a long time before we hear back from her,” said Piche.

And until then, Kennedy’s family is sitting on pins and needles.

“We’re just supporting each other and keeping an eye on the news and social media and waiting to hear anything,” said Piche. “There’s nothing much we can do.”
