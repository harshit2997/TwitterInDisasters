The recent unrest in Nepal following two strong earthquakes has many questioning when the country will be safe again.

We talked to a man who has family in the middle of the devastation.

Nepal was hit by a 7.3 aftershock Tuesday, not even three weeks after a 7.8 earthquake.

Damber Budhathoki is here in Huntsville working, but his heart in Nepal with the rest of his family.

"I called them a bunch of times, but finally I've been able to talk to them one time and that's it," Budhathoki said.

One time, he said, just to hear they are okay.

Budhathoki described how his family is out of their home and living on edge with the mindset another earthquake could happen at any time.

"But still, they are pretty much in terror, they are scared to go back to home and sleep because they don't know when another one is coming," he said.

With reports of deaths and injuries in Nepal, a NASA response team here in Huntsville is watching out more new threats.

"Normal day, not really been normal in the past two weeks, but it's been acquiring as many images as possible looking at where to point some of the satellites we can target," said Eric Anderson.

Poring over thousands of satellite images in a matter of hours, the NASA SERVIR group is meeting the demands from Nepal.

"The need that has been clearly expressed to us is we need the images. Our role is making sure they can access this in Nepal. So, they'll look through these line-by-line and make a note and compare it to a previous image," said Anderson.

As they keep a watch out for other threats like landslides and flooding, Budhathoki says the support he's received has gone long way for his family.

"We collected, raised money, and all that money were fixing to send it that helps people over there," Budhathoki said.

You can join the relief effort by donating to UNICEF or the Red Cross.
