Medair travelled with partner organisation Mission East over narrow, twisting roads heavily damaged by the quake to reach Bhotachaur, a community that had been unreached by aid since the earthquake struck on 25 April.

According to a report from the World Health Organisation, Sindhupalchowk is the worst-hit district for fatalities in Nepal, with more than 2,500 people confirmed dead and more than 700 injured.

"Villagers came down from the hills and we handed out relief items," said Nathalie Fauveau, Medair's relief worker. "They were traumatised. Many houses had collapsed and people had been sleeping in makeshift shelters, using wood, tin pieces, and fabric salvaged from their damaged homes to get protection from the cold and rain. People were so thankful for the help we brought and insisted on inviting us for tea, despite losing everything."

This week, Medair will travel to Haibung in Sindhupalchowk and intends to reach more than 1,000 people with essential items such as tarpaulins, emergency water containers and solar lamps. Rain and landslides continue to make access to remote communities challenging, and with monsoon season approaching, the difficult conditions could severely hamper relief efforts.

"Roads are extremely steep and are impossible to drive up," said Nathalie. "Villagers are coming down to the distribution site but soon we'll have to hike up with porters, carrying relief items for several hours. It will be physically demanding but we're eager to go as no other organisation has been reaching these communities."

Medair has provided emergency health kits to Medecins du Monde at the district hospital in Sindhulpalchowk. The kits include medication and are expected to help 10,000 people over a period of three months.
