Medical clinic destroyed in Nepal earthquakes - Spokane, North Idaho News & Weather KHQ.com

The recent earthquakes in Nepal have wreaked havoc all over the country destroying villages, cities, and taking lives. More than 4,000 lives were lost in the tragedy.Among the destruction was a medical clinic in the town of Baseri, the first of its kind in the town. Denise Attwood of Spokane, and a friend, who grew up in the town, came up with the idea back in 2007."The goal was to bring primary healthcare to this area that had not had anything like that before," says Attwood. "She (her friend) lost several siblings to very simple things that could've been prevented."They started raising funds, and by 2010, construction was finished and the clinic held its grand opening. Serving about ten patients a day over the last five years, locals felt that it was a success and a very positive addition to the region."They said it's just been such a huge boom to the whole village," Attwood recalls when she was in Baseri just a few weeks ago. "Those people from remote areas now have access."Now, the clinic once a beacon of hope for the ill or injured of the area lays in ruins, destroyed by the devastating earthquakes that hit Nepal."What took three years to build, took three seconds to destroy," says Attwood. "It's completely gone."Right now Attwood is working with relief agencies to try to get aid to the area. "Baseri is actually a great place to have a medical camp," says Attwood. "People already expect that there's going to be a clinic there. I'm sure that people are coming out of the remote areas that are hurt expecting to get help there."She and her family also run a fair trading company that imports wholesale goods from Nepal and have other programs through their non-profit that benefit the country. "Right now the clinic is at the forefront of our thoughts because it's such a dire situation."Attwood says there are plans to rebuild, but right now they are trying to help the local people with their immediate needs.If you'd like to donate to the cause, click here: https://ganeshhimaltrading.com/fair-trade-more/baseri-health-clinic/
