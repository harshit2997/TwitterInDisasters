A LOT Polish Airlines Dreamliner is due to land at Warsaw's Chopin Airport at around 8 pm local time.

Besides a number of Polish passengers, the plane will also be transporting travellers from the Czech Republic, Ukraine and United States.

Meanwhile, the Nepalese government has confirmed that the death toll has now risen to 4356 (2pm Polish time), and that the ultimate number of fatalities may reach as high as 10,000.

The UN has indicated that as many as 8 million people have been affected by the disaster.

The flow of foreign aid to stricken areas has been irregular, owing to congestion at Kathmandu's only airport.

Poles at work on rescue mission

An emergency Polish team of 81 firefighters that arrived in Kathmandu on Monday is currently at work at Lalitpur, 12 km from the Nepalese capital.

The firefighters, together with 12 sniffer dogs brought specially from Poland, are combing through the rubble of collapsed buildings.

Several Polish humanitarian groups have launched fundraising drives to help those stricken by the tragedy. For more details on how to help, click on the accompanying link. (nh)
