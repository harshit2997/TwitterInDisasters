NEW DELHI/ KATHMANDU : Toll from the massive quake in Nepal mounted to more than 3,218 while an inter-ministerial team of the Union Home Ministry, headed by B K Prasad, today left for quake-hit neighbouring country for coordination in relief and rescue operation. According to reports, people who stayed in open grounds and streets refused to go back to their homes, fearing fresh aftershocks. Nepal government sources said as many as 3,218 people have died and more than 6,000 were injured in the devastating quake, as per the recent data. It is feared that the toll could be much higher. Rescuers have launched fresh efforts to remove huge mounds of debris. However, rescue operations are hampered due to incessant rains, which the weatherman fear may continue for next 24 hours. Confusion at the Kathmandu airport ran unabated as every stranded tourist tried to get out of the tragedy-hit country. Passenger queues were seen there while many tried to catch buses to come back to India via road route. As many as 66 aftershocks have jolted Nepal ever since the massive quake hit the mountain country on Saturday. India’s rescue and relief teams, including the NDRF, are on full swing to provide necessary aids to victims. Locals have formed teams to mount vigil on areas so that unsocial elements could not enter into deserted houses. More than 20 bodies have been recovered from Mount Everest base camps where an avalanche was triggered by tremblor. In Bihar, people remained in open fields and parks as a precautionary measure. Panic among people was triggered last night by a rumour that there could be a possibility of a fresh quake as freakish astronomical phenomenon of ‘ulta chand’ (inverted moon) was observed in the sky. However, rumours were later dismissed by Chief Minister Nitish Kumar. More than 60 people have so far died in Bihar, Uttar pradesh, West Bengal and Rajasthan.
