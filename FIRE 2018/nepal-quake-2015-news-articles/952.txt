Indian Army to undertake long term operations in Nepal

With a large number of ex-servicemen living in Nepal, the Indian Army will launch long term operations there to reach out to them, Defence Minister Manohar Parrikar said on Sunday.

The minister’s statement came in the wake of magnitude 7.9 and 6.7 quakes striking the Himalayan nation on Saturday and Sunday, respectively.

Parrikar said there are 1.6 lakh ex-servicemen living in Nepal and long term operations will be launched. “Army has good connection with Nepal… they will be doing long term operations.”

Army chief General Dalbir Singh, who belongs to the Gorkha regiment, told IANS that several steps were being taken.

“There are a large number of ex-servicemen living in Nepal. We are specially concerned, given the deep ties with Nepal,” General Dalbir Singh told IANS.

“We are sending teams to asses the situation, whatever is needed will be done,” he said.
