Employers of Nepalese workers in Malaysia have been urged to provide assistance to their workers whose families have been impacted by the earthquake.

KUALA LUMPUR: The Embassy of Nepal in Kuala Lumpur urged employers on Wednesday (April 29) to assist Nepalese workers in Malaysia who have been affected by the devastating earthquake that hit the country on the weekend.



The embassy estimated some 900,000 Nepalese live in Malaysia, making it one of the most popular destinations for citizens seeking work overseas.



In a statement, the embassy urged concerned employers to help staff contact their families, assist in sending them back to Nepal if necessary, and provide at least one month's salary in advance "if employees needed to support their families affected by the quake".



"The Nepalese nationals working in different companies in Malaysia might have lost their loved ones and are worried for them. Therefore they may want to contact their families and also go back to see them," the statement read.



Some Malaysian employers were happy to heed the call.

"We've been in contact with some of the staff and we've been asking them if any of their family members have been affected," said Michael Forsythe, whose company employs Nepali security guards. "If there are, they make certain requests for financial aid. We'll certainly look into it but it'll be made on a case-by-case basis."

Aside from government initiatives, Malaysians have also made private donations and organised fundraising for relief efforts in Nepal.

"As a good citizen of Malaysia, we should, even though they are not directly related. As a human being we also need to save a life," said Pearly Yap from the Federation of I-Kuan Tao Associations Malaysia.
