UPDATE (WKOW) -- Dozens gathered for a candlelight vigil in Madison, in honor of the victims of the Nepal earthquake.

“Looking at the news and hearing from them, it's devastating how much effect the earthquake has had,” said Santosh Lamichhane, a Nepal native and member of the Nepali American Friendship Association.

Lamichhane says his friends and family still living in that country are struggling.

“People are living in tents, there's no food, water or anything,” he said.

In a show of solidarity with those suffering in the wake of the Nepal earthquake, Santosh and dozens of others gathered at the top of State Street to pray. The Nepali American Friendship Association also collected donations to help relief efforts.

“We are here, no matter where we are, we think about them, we share their fear and pain,” Lamichhane said.

And while many at the vigil are Nepali Americans and some still have family in the country, others have a less direct connection, but still came out to show support.

“We're all part of the human race, there's a lot of negative stuff going on right now so I think it's important to spread love and not hate so that's why I'm here,” said Karen P. Wilson, who attended the vigil.

And as the sun set, the group lit candles-- in hopes of shining a light during a dark time for not only those in Nepal, but for the Nepali community right here in Dane County.

Lamichhane says he hopes this vigil and other events will help to encourage donations for months to come, as the recovery effort is expected to take years.

*****MADISON (WKOW) -- Nepalese Americans living in Madison are gathering to honor those affected by the earthquake, hoping to bring our community together in support of hard-hit villages in Nepal.Santosh Lamichhane is a member of the Nepali American Friendship Association, helping organize the vigil Wednesday night. His family is right in the middle of the devastation in Nepal. He says it's been difficult being so far away after the earthquake hit his hometown over the weekend.Lamichhane tells 27 news 90 percent of the houses in his village have collapsed. Luckily, his parents and sister escaped the quake unharmed, but some others in that community didn't make it.He and his family is shaken by fears of ongoing aftershocks and worried about the rural areas of Nepal that haven't yet gotten any help.

"We've been hearing there are long lines in hospitals, people are living in tents," Lamichhane says. "There's no food, water especially in the rural areas there is no relief yet."



While immediate help is most needed, he hopes the community remembers with such devastation, long-term support will be essential.



Nepali in Madison hope the vigil Wednesday night at the Capitol spreads the word about how each person can contribute to the effort to help Nepal. They ask people to support organizations like the American Red Cross, Doctors without Borders or Sarvodaya USA.
