Earthquake felt across North India, Nepal
</headline>

<text>
On Tuesday around 12.40 PM, Strong earthquake shocks were felt across North Indian regions, Nepal and Afghanistan.

The quake’s epicenter was close to Everest Base Camp, which was evacuated after an avalanche triggered by the April 25 quake killed 18 climbers. Mountaineers seeking to scale the world’s tallest peak have called off this year’s Everest season.

There has been no report of any casualty or damage so far.

The U.S. Geological Survey said the quake had a magnitude of 7.4 and struck 68 km west of the town of Namche Bazar, close to Mount Everest.

“This is a really big one,” said Prakash Shilpakar, the owner of a handicrafts shop in Kathmandu who was trying to call his parents in the town of Bhaktapur, devastated in the April 25 quake.

Tremors were felt across northern India and as far away as the capital New Delhi, where buildings swayed for more than a minute and people scurried into the streets.

Earthquake Summary:

– Magnitude 7.4

– Epicentre near Namche Bazar

– Shallow depth of about 19km
