Aquaboxes going to Nepal
</headline>

Rotary Club of Stratford members assembled hundreds of Aquaboxes this past weekend to help provide clean drinking water for people around the world affected by natural disasters.

They’re on their way to some of those people right now.

A total of 456 Aquaboxes were picked up Wednesday by the Toronto-based humanitarian aid organization GlobalMedic, which will deliver them to Nepal later this week.

“What we’re trying to do is help where we can, and do it quickly,” said Walt Bathe, chairman of the Rotary Club of Stratford’s Aquabox committee.

The timing of the club’s latest effort was coincidental, but fortuitous.

At the same time as Rotary members were building the water purification kits at the Stratford Festival scene shops Saturday, a massive earthquake was causing devastation in and around Nepal’s capital city of Kathmandu, killing thousands, injuring thousands more, and leaving countless others homeless.

Bathe said the club received the request from GlobalMedic Monday night for its Aquaboxes.

On Wednesday morning, 10 club members gathered at a Brunswick Street storage facility and loaded the 456 boxes, assembly line-style, into the back of a delivery truck.

The whole process took less than 40 minutes.

Bathe said it was “extremely gratifying” to know that the Aquaboxes will be making a difference in hard-hit Nepal.

Aid agencies there have identified clean drinking water as a priority for people affected by the quake.

Each Aquabox is fitted with filters than can purify enough water for a family of five for an entire year.

After the boxes arrive in Toronto, GlobalMedic will add basic hygiene supplies, including soap, before shipping them off to Nepal.

With its stock of Aquaboxes depleted, Bathe said the club is preparing for another appeal for donations to build more.

At roughly $50 each, it costs $25,000 to produce 500 Aquaboxes.

“We want to be ready for the next disaster,” he said, “and you know there’s going to be one.”

Donations can be made by contacting Rotary Club of Stratford members directly, or through the club’s website at http://rotarystratford.com

The club has posted a video on that site showing its previous batch of Aquaboxes being delivered by GlobalMedic to Vanuatu, in the South Pacific, after Cyclone Pam hit that area in March.
