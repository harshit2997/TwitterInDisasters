The Salvation Army Responds to Devastating Earthquake in Nepal
</headline>

<text>
The Salvation Army is mobilizing emergency response personnel and supplies after a devastating 7.8-magnitude Earthquake in Nepal that flattened homes and buildings, causing widespread damage across the region and killing more than 2,000 people.

“We are initiating a response to meet basic, urgent needs with shelter, food, water, and other necessary relief items. We ask supporters to please pray for the people of Nepal,” said Lieutenant Colonel William Mockabee, Executive Director of The Salvation Army World Service Office.

With more than 75 offices throughout the area, volunteers and staff are well prepared to service the immediate and long-term needs of those impacted by natural disasters. Since 1882, The Salvation Army has served the people of its India Eastern Territory.

“Donations from the generous public will help provide basic necessities that survivors desperately need right now,” said Lt. Colonel Ron Busroe, The Salvation Army’s National Community Relations and Development Secretary. “But the effects of this tragedy will be felt for months — even years. We know that emotional and spiritual counseling is equally important for survivors to deal with the gravity of the situation.”

Monetary donations are the most critical need for survivors. The Salvation Army has set up a designated fund where 100 percent of gifts go to relief efforts in Nepal.
