Nepal Earthquake Update - 1 May 2015 @ 1620 BST

Alex Langdon just called from the Summit Hotel. All of her Mera and Island Peak team have just flown into Kathmandu from Biratnagar. On their flight were also Gavin, Michele, Flo and George from the Everest team, plus Sierra and Michael from Grand Journey. So, that's everyone out of Lukla/Biratnagar. Alex said they were very tired, partly because it had been so hot and humid in Biratnagar, where they'd been most of the day, having flown from Lukla earlier in the morning. They are settling into tents at the Summit, with one member of Alex's team flying home tonight.

David Hamilton is making his way down the Khumbu (currently in Namche) and last said that he intends to walk out to Jiri.

The Dhaulagiri Circuit teams are in Pokhara, where they'll be based until their flights home from Kathmandu.

Chhimi Gurung, one of our Sherpas who was injured at Everest Base Camp, is now home. His head injury is not as serious as first thought. However, Kam Nuru Sherpa, who was also injured, will require surgery to ensure he recovers fully.

The Jagged Globe office, which has been open 24 hours since the earthquake, will be closed over the Bank Holiday weekend. If you need to speak to someone about a family member on one of our teams in Nepal, please phone the office and your call will be re-directed.
