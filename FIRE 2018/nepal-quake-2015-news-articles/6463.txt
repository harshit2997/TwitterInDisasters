Dozens Killed, Thousands Injured As Nepal Hit With Second Powerful Earthquake
</headline>

<text>
Just weeks after a 7.8 magnitude tremor rocked Nepal leaving thousands dead, another strong earthquake hit the country on Tuesday. Todayâ€™s 7.4 magnitude quake emanated from a remote area near the border with China. So far, there are at least 29 known casualties and thousands of serious injuries.

More, via CNN:

The shock waves rippled out from a remote area of eastern Nepal, near the border with China, leveling buildings already damaged by the devastating quake that killed thousands of people two and a half weeks ago.

The magnitude 7.3 earthquake Tuesday struck at a depth of about 15 kilometers (9 miles), the U.S. Geological Survey said, slightly revising its earlier estimates. A series of significant aftershocks, the strongest measuring magnitude 6.3, followed the initial larger quake.

The earthquake shook a country still picking up the pieces from the magnitude 7.8 quake that hit central Nepal on April 25, killing more than 8,000 people.

The epicenter of the new earthquake was about 75 kilometers east of Kathmandu, the Nepali capital where many buildings were destroyed in the earlier quake.

[Some of the] deaths were reported in the town of Chautara, about 35 kilometers east of Kathmandu, said Paul Dillon, a spokesman for the International Organization for Migration.

The bustling capital was once again plunged into panic as residents rushed into the streets.

"People are very scared and they don't know what is going on," said CNN iReporter Prashup Rajbhandari in Kathmandu. He said he thought the quake had cracked his house.
