The Disaster Management Centre (DMC) has set up a special coordinating centre to collect relief assistance to be dispatched to earthquake-hit Nepal, officials said today.



DMC media spokesman Sarath Lal Kumara said two hotlines (0112136136 and 0112136255) had been set up for anyone to contact the DMC regarding the extension of relief assistance or inquiries. He said 33 Sri Lankans had been brought from Nepal to Sri Lanka. 156 medical workers from Sri Lanka will leave for Nepal today to assist the Nepalis in relief work.
