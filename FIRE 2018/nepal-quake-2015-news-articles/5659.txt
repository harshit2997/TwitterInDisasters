Stray dog turns hero as he helps Japanese rescue teams look for survivors of Nepalese quake

Already a hero in Japan after his first mission last year, when he discovered two survivors trapped by a deadly mudslide near his home town, Yumenosuke is now on his first overseas trip, hoping to repeat his success.

Yumenosuke, a four-year-old former stray from Hiroshima, has been in Nepal since Sunday with a Japanese emergency aid team, helping sniff out earthquake survivors.

It's lucky, though, that he's even here at all. He was recruited in 2010 by Peace Winds Japan, a non-profit organisation on the hunt for talented mutts to work as rescue dogs, on the very day that he'd been due to be put down as a stray.

Now, with his golden retriever partner Haruku, he is doing good, and helping raise awareness of the problem of stray dogs in Japan to boot.

Almost 30,000 dogs were euthanised in Japan in 2013, according to an Environment Ministry report, after they were either abandoned by their owners or left unsold in pet shops.
