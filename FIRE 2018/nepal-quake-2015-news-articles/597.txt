NEW DELHI -- Dan Fredinburg, a senior Google executive, was one of more than 17 killed in an avalanche that injured nearly 40 more, some critically, when it swept through the base camp at Mount Everest on Saturday following a devastating earthquake.

The 7.8 magnitude earthquake, the worst to hit landlocked Nepal in over 80 years, has left nearly 2,000 people dead, and leveled many temples and architectural jewels. In neighboring India, it has claimed at least 34 more lives.

Fredinburg was at Everest, the world's highest mountain, with three other Google employees. "The other three Googlers with him are safe and we are working to get them home quickly," Lawrence You, a Google executive, said in a blog post.

Fredinburg headed privacy for Google X, the company's secretive innovation arm, and was responsible for product management with the company's privacy team. The Google climbers were part of a group with U.K.-based Jagged Globe, which organizes mountain expeditions around the world. Confirming Fredinburg's death, Jagged Globe said others in the group at base camp have non-life threatening injuries.

Fredinburg's sister, Megan, said on Instagram that her older brother had sustained a "major head injury."

"His soul and his spirit will live on in so many of us," she said.

U.S. actress Sophia Bush described Fredinburg, her former boyfriend, as a "brilliant engineer" and an "incredible friend."

"There are no adequate words. Today I find myself attempting to pick up the pieces of my heart that have broken into such tiny shards," Bush said on Instagram. "I'll likely never find them all."
