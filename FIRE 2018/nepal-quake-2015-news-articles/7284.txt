Wreckage of U.S. Marine Helicopter Found in Nepal

A Nepalese search team Friday found the wreckage of a U.S. Marine helicopter that went missing this week while flying relief materials to earthquake-stricken villages.

Nepalese Defense Secretary Ishwori Prasad Paudyal said so far three charred bodies have been pulled from the downed helicopter, which the Nepalese army spotted in a mountainous area east of Kathmandu.

U.S. rescue officers were at the site Friday afternoon and had identified the wreckage, a U.S. military statement said.

"The assessment of the site is ongoing and a thorough investigation will be conducted," the statement said.

Mr. Paudyal said search teams weren't expecting to find any survivors. There were six U.S. Marines and two Nepalese soldiers aboard the helicopter when it went missing Tuesday evening.

The UH-1Y Huey was found 8 miles north of where it had last been seen, near Charikot, in Dolakha district, which suffered landslides and extensive building damage during fresh earthquakes and aftershocks that rattled Nepal on Tuesday. A stronger quake had killed more than 8,000 people just weeks before.

Tuesday's temblors killed 117 people and injured at least 2,872, Nepalese authorities said Friday.

U.S. and Nepalese aircraft had been scouring the area north of Charikot since Tuesday evening. Nepalese ground and boat forces combed rivers, slopes and peaks.

The rough terrain made the search difficult. There was one false alarm Friday morning, according to Lt. Col. Biswas Bikram Shah, who is leading Nepalese forces in Charikot. An officer had spotted what looked like the wreckage of the U.S. Huey, but it turned out to be debris from vehicles destroyed in a landslide.
