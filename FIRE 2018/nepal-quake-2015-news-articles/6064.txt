A Morganton mother who hasn't heard from her daughter in Nepal since before the devastating earthquake struck, received a phone call Friday afternoon that her daughter had signed in at the embassy in Katmandu.

Lee Opp received a call from the US embassy notifying her that her daughter, Sandy Desorgher was alive.

"Just a few minutes ago, a gentleman from the embassy in Katmandu called me and said she had signed in at the embassy on April 26 and that she was alive. He couldn't tell me if she was actually at the embassy now because he said some people came and went, but he said they had food and water at the embassy for her," Opp said over the phone with WBTV after receiving the call.

Desorgher and her husband Max left for Nepal two weeks ago. Desogher was starting a new teaching job and days after she arrived in Katmandu, the earthquake hit.

"We don't know about her husband, but I have to assume he's okay because they would have been side by side, they would have been together. [The man from the embassy] didn't have his name on his particular list," Opp said.

Opp and her family have not been able to get much sleep the past few days. "What we've gone through is a lot of worry and a lot of sleepless nights. We didn't know if she had maybe been buried without identification," Opp said.

Desorgher and Max left Cambodia on April 19, en route to Katmandu. Her job was to be with the Geneva Global School, a Green School Alliance affiliate. Opp said before her daughter recently turned in the direction of teaching, she researched autism and worked with autistic children all over the world.Opp was given no information on where Desorgher planned to stay or go, and she wasn't sure how to find out. She contacted the State Department, the BBC, several aid agencies and anyone she thought might be able to help.

Emotional, Opp said her biggest worry was " never knowing, never finding out. But now I know, and she is alive, and she is OK."

Opp watched media coverage of the destruction and feared the worst.

"Even I saw one thing on TV where they were burning bodies and I thought she could be - that could be her," she said, because "they couldn't take the time to identify them."

Opp said when she does get the chance to talk to her daughter again, she will tell her how many people cared and tried to help with finding her, and that "everyone loves her."
