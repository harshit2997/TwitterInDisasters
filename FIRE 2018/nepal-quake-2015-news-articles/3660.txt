SRIKAKULAM:Responding to the call given by International Red Cross Society (IRCS), the district administration has initiated a blood donation programme to collect 1,000 units of blood for the Nepal earthquake victims. The IRCS has requested India to arrange for the same.

The Indian Red Cross Society, Nagarjuna Agrichem and Mohsin Eye Bank, in association with the district administration organised an awareness programme on the programme Tuesday. At the inauguration, additional joint collector P Rajanikantha Rao explained the need of blood.

Nepal needs a large quantity of blood to save thousands of lives. The people should come forward to donate blood to save the neighbouring nationals, Rajanikantha Rao said. He also asked people to donate their eyes which would give sight to two persons.

Indian Red Cross district chairman P Jaganmohan Rao said that every person should feel that donation of blood was a social obligation. He said that the 1,000 units of blood would be sent to Nepal from Visakhapatnam airport.

Vice-president of Nagarjuna Agrichem P Varadarajulu, executive engineer of Sarva Siksha Abhiyan P Sugunakara Rao, Red Cross doctor MRK Das and others were present. People interested in donating blood and eyes can call on 1910, 08942-226555 and 226111.

During the programme, the Red Cross doctors received a call from a person seeking AB positive blood. Following the doctorâ€™s appeal, one Nagarjuna Agrichem employee L Ramesh, who is AB positive, expressed his willing to donate blood on the spot.
