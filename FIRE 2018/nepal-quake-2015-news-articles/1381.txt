At least 3,218 people have been confirmed dead in the devastating earthquake which hit Nepal, authorities said on Monday.

Rameshwor Dangal, head of Nepal's disaster management division, said around 6,500 people were injured.

Thousands of people in Nepal spent the second consecutive day outside their homes, as a 6.7-magnitude quake hit Nepal on Sunday, which was followed by multiple aftershocks, Xinhua news agency reported.

Rescue operations are underway and officials have warned that the number of casualties could rise.

An emergency cabinet meeting has announced 29 districts in the country as crisis zones, the Nepal home ministry stated. The powerful quake also jolted India and Bangladesh.

Amid the devastating tremors, the Nepal government has appealed for assistance from the international community.
