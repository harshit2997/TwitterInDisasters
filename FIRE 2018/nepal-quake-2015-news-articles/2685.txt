After the devastating earthquake in Nepal, students at the South Dakota School of Mines are raising money to give back to their home country.

There are currently 14 Nepalese students attending the university.

Tuesday they began collecting donations which will be given to UNICEF.

Roshan Thakuri says the students don't have a specific goal they're trying to reach.

He says every dollar makes a difference.

Thakuri says, "With $1 you can feed a whole family in Nepal for a day, so every dollar counts. So we're not setting any goal, but we're just working with the School of Mines community and they can come forward and help us."

Thakuri says his family is safe and he has talked to them every day since the disaster.

If you would like to donate to their cause, the students will be on the lower level of the Surbeck Center on campus and will collect donations from 9 a.m. to 6 p.m. through May 1st.
