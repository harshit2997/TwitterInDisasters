2 UM students survive Nepal earthquake

MISSOULA, Mont. - Two University of Montana Students were in Nepal during the earthquake this weekend and are safe.

Donna Beall looks over all of the pharmacy students -- she is particularly worried about two of them.

"Globally, you're concerned with everyone that is in Nepal and your thoughts and prayers are still with everyone there, but knowing that two of our students you know very well, and they're three weeks away from graduation, it just hit me a little differently," said Beall.

Drew Clavelot is a Montana native from Anaconda and Taryn Moore is from Anchorage, Alaska. The couple left for Nepal on the April 23 to visit a friend to visit a friend in the Peace Corps.

Beall and a close friend of the couple, Drew Pryne, told us where the couple was during the time of the earthquake.

"They were actually standing out in a square of some kind in another town close by to Kathmandu, and they were watching things unravel right before their eyes," said Pryne.

The couple is safe and is staying at the U.S. Embassy Building.

Both Pryne and Beall were relieved to hear they were safe.

"Drew and Taryn are a pretty great couple. You can't really say anything bad about them. They are a lot of fun to be around, they are always willing to do stuff with you," said Pryne.

"Drew and Taryn are wonderful students; I've known them since they started the pharmacy programs four years ago," said Beall.

Now, friends are looking forward to seeing the couple return home and graduate from pharmacy school.

Friends and family expect Pryne and Moore to be back this Sunday or Monday.
