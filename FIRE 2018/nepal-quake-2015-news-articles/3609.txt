Fundraiser lunch to aid Nepal quake victims
</headline>

<text>
A group of Evanston residents seeking to help victims of the earthquake in Nepal has planned a fundraiser brunch at the Mt. Everest restaurant downtown on Thursday.

One of the organizers, Steve Hagerty of Hagerty Consulting, says that after seeing news reports about the disaster, "I was overwhelmed with feelings of sadness for the loss of life and concern about the plight of the survivors."



Hagerty says Ramakant Kharel, owner of the Nepali-themed restaurant at 630 Church St., has agreed to host the buffet lunch fundraiser on Thursday, April 30, between 11 a.m. and 2:30 p.m.

The price for a full lunch is $15, plus tax and gratuity. The restaurant will donate 10 percent of total lunch sales to the Nepali American Center, and Hagerty Consulting will make a matching gift for any donations made to the emergency response group AmeriCares during the luncheon..
