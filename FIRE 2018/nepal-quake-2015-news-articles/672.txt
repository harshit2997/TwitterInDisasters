Taipei, April 26 (CNA) The Republic of China government donated US$300,000 to Nepal late Saturday after a powerful magnitude 7.9 earthquake struck the country earlier the same day.



On the instruction of Premier Mao Chih-kuo (毛治國), the Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) immediately relayed Taiwan's condolences to Nepal through Taiwan's representative office in India, Executive Yuan spokesman Sun Lih-chyun (孫立群) said Saturday.



Taiwan has also expressed its willingness to help with the rescue and research efforts in Nepal, Sun said, adding that 38 Taiwanese tourists in Nepal, all safe and sound, have been relocated by Taiwan's personnel there. No Taiwanese was injured in the incident.



Meanwhile, the MOFA has raised its four-tier travel alert for Nepal to the highest level of "red," advising Taiwan's citizens to suspend trips to that country.



The strong tremor has killed more than 1,800 and injured over 4,700 in Nepal, according to the latest foreign wire services.
