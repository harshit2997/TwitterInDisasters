Chabad Nepal rabbi’s children evacuated to Israel

Read on for article

As he continues to follow closely the developments in Nepal and the progress of Israel’s aid mission there, Israel’s President Reuven Rivlin has hosted the children of the Lubavitch Chabad emissaries based in Nepal.

With Chani and Rabbi Chezki Lipshitz still in Nepal assisting with the recovery efforts, their children – Shmuel, Rivki, & Yitzchak, aged between four and six – arrived at the President’s Residence with their grandmother Yehudit Fleischman, and their Nepalese carer Lolita, who lives with the family at the Chabad house in Katmandu.

The President warmly welcomed the children and soon delved into his desk drawer for a box of chocolates which he distributed amongst his guests. The President heard from them about their experience over the recent days since the devastating earthquake, and their subsequent arrival in Israel. The children told the President that they were set to attend schools and kindergartens in Israel from tomorrow, until the rescue efforts were nearer completion and they were able to return safely.

During their visit, the President telephoned their parents in Nepal. In an emotional conversation, the President told them, “The work you are doing for the whole world, and of course for the Israelis in Nepal, is extraordinary, from a Jewish, Israeli, and universal perspective. The way in which you open your home and give others a sense of home in times of need is tremendous.”

Chani and Chezki thanked the President for his warm words, and reassured him, “We are all well, and so pleased to be able to reach out a helping hand to those in need. This is our mission.”

The President handed the phone to their daughter Rivki, who, in a touching moment, asked her mother when they were coming home. Chani replied, “Soon, there are still many people we need to help. We miss you very much, and we’ll see you soon.”

The President added, “Just as you open your home to the whole world, we are delighted to open our home to your children. We will look after them, and through them extend to you our thanks.”

After they met with the President, the children had a tour of the President’s Residence.
