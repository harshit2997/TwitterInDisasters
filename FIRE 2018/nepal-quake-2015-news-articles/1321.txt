A pair of British honeymooners have described the terrifying moment an avalanche tore through their camp during their ascent of Mount Everest.

Adventurous Alex Chappatte and her husband Sam, both 28, were in their tents when the tremors struck the world's highest mountain. It has since emerged that at least 17 people were killed on Everest during the Nepal earthquake.

Updating their blog via satellite phone, they wrote: "The earthquake hit about 30 minutes after we had crossed the icefall yesterday morning and found our tents .

"The ground started shaking violently but before we could react Dan (Mazur, the expedition leader) was shouting "Get out of your f****** tents, grab your ice axes!"

"We staggered out to see an avalanche coming straight at us. A blast of wind knocked us down but we were able to get up and run to shelter behind some tents and anchor ourselves with our axes.

"The wind was so strong that Pat was knocked down and pivoted on his axe. We focused on keeping an air hole so we could breathe in the powder.

"Dan was fantastic, shouting directions at us, keeping us together and strong. Our tents were only lightly covered so we dug them out and moved them into the middle of the valley."

The couple, formerly of North London but who have now set up a business in Ghana, were at the centre of Everest's worst ever disaster.

The bodies of 17 climbers were recovered from the mountain today after being caught in avalanches. A plane carrying the first 15 injured climbers landed in Kathmandu at around noon local time.

"There is a lot of confusion on the mountain. The toll will rise," said Gelu Sherpa, one of the walking wounded among the first 15 injured climbers flown to Kathmandu.

"Tents have been blown away," said Sherpa, his head in bandages.

The British couple, who have both done various extreme expeditions throughout the world, added: "No-one knows how bad the damage to the Icefall route down is yet, but we have heard that our part of Basecamp has been flattened.

"There is talk of possibly hiking up to Camp 2 but for the moment we are acclimatising and waiting.

"Helicopters have been in to pick up the sick and injured. We're OK. We've got food and the sherpas are being amazing. We're OK."

Mr Mazur today said survivors of the horrific avalanche on Everest are battling freezing wind blasts caused by thousands of tons of loose ice.

He was was taking a team, including the Chappattes, up the mountain and had reached camp one when the earthquake struck in Nepal.

Trapped at 20,000 feet, the climber from Bristol said his route down had been destroyed and asked people to "please pray for everyone".

This morning he revealed 13 fellow climbers had passed away and said survivors were battling icy blasts "destroying base camp's heart".

It is not clear if they passed away overnight or during the avalanche.

Writing on Twitter at 6.30am UK time, he said: "12+1 member #Everest BC TV team passed away. RIP.

"Earthquake loosed tons of ice down, creating wind blast destroying BC' heart."

The desperate climber, who is understood to split his time between England and America, is a leader with Summit Climb - a group which promotes sustainable travel.
