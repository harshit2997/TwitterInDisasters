A special team of Gujarat-based officers will soon be heading to Nepal to ensure better coordination among various Indian agencies engaged in relief operations there even as around 550 people from the state have returned home safely so far from the quake-ravaged nation.



"The Central government has decided to send a seven-member team of Gujarat-based officers to Nepal. Our task is to resolve issues related to coordination among various agencies engaged in relief and rescue work. We will leave for Nepal after receiving final orders," said state Health Commissioner J P Gupta, who is going to head the team.



Meanwhile, Relief Commissioner D N Pandey said majority of Gujaratis, stranded in Nepal since the temblor jolted it last Saturday, have returned to their home safely due to concerted efforts of the Union government."Till now, around 550 Gujaratis have returned to the state safely. We learned that almost all Gujaratis have already came back. Those who have not, might be on their way, as they are returning via road or trains," said Pandey.He said as many as 25,000 food packets have already been dispatched to Nepal in coordination with the Delhi-based Resident Commissioner's office as per the announcement made by the state government earlier.Pandey said two teams of HAM radio operators from the state were already dispatched to Nepal to aid agencies there on communication front."Due to the earthquake, communication lines were damaged in Nepal, making it difficult for rescue teams to communicate. To help them on the communication front, we have sent two HAM Radio teams there," added Pandey.
