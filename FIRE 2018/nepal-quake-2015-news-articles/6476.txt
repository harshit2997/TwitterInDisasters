Burlington's David Adcock travels to Nepal to assess ERDO's aid strategy

As CEO of ERDO – Emergency Relief & Development Overseas - Burlington’s David Adcock will travel to Nepal tomorrow to assess his organization’s current and future humanitarian efforts there in the wake of two devastating earthquakes.

A second earthquake, registering 7.3, which hit Nepal today, sets back desperately needed humanitarian efforts and adds to the misery and terror of survivors, said Adcock.

“This just reawakens the tentativeness of the context over there. People are just as you would imagine, quite terrified; there’s a high level of anxiety,” he said. “People are already on the edge and this is putting people over the edge.”

More than 8,000 people died and more than 18,000 people were injured in the April 25 earthquake. Early reports indicate that at least 48 people have died, and more than 1,000 are injured, as a result of today’s earthquake.

Once in Nepal, Adcock’s role is to execute a site assessment, and through consultations with front line aid workers, decide a future course of action for ERDO.

ERDO, the humanitarian agency of The Pentecostal Assemblies of Canada, has been in Nepal since late April, organizing emergency feeding stations with its local partners, Assemblies of God Nepal, Talitha Koumi Ministries and GEMS (Gospel Echoing Ministry Society)

“We are feeding upwards of 3,000 people a day and we had moved into providing emergency relief kits,” which include basic food supplies such as rice and lentils as well as blankets, tarps and flashlights; all helping people to get through the next few days, he said.

ERDO currently has approximately 15 aid workers on the ground in Nepal.

“But they are mobilizing church people from Nepal to reach out to their neighbours so scores of people really are helping. That’s one of the great advantages of faith, and people motivated by faith to reach out to their local neighbours in need - we are resourcing.”

A day earlier, his organization was distributing relief kits at the epicenter of where the earthquake hit early this morning in eastern Nepal, near Mount Everest.
