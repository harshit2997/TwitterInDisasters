Local Volunteers Aiding Communication in Nepal

April 27, 2015â€”NAZ Today reports that relief efforts in Nepal may be improved by the efforts of two Red Cross volunteers from Northern Arizona. The death tool from the recent earthquake in Nepal has now topped 3,000, and officials expect the number to rise. The earthquake is believed to the Nepal's strongest in almost a century.

Reporter Kendall Perkinson found out more about the disaster and the locals involved in relief efforts.

"What happened in Nepal is a result of the Indian plate actually colliding into the Eurasian plate. So India's moving north, relative basically to China, at a rate of 3.5 to 5 centimeters per year depending where you are," said Ryan Porter, and assistant professor of geology at Northern Arizona University.

A large earthquake in the region was not unexpected. Sixteen months ago Red Cross volunteers Glen and Julie Bradley of Lakeside, AZ traveled to Nepal to set up radio towers in anticipation of just such a disaster.

"I think it's really important because the radio system that we put in 16 months ago will cover the entire Kathmandu Valley, and all the other types of communication that you usually expect to have in a populated area potentially are not going to be operational," said Glen Bradley.

The couple has been airlifted back to Nepal to assist in communications during relief efforts.

"They know where to go when they get there. They don't know if those towers are down," said Frank Bourget, executive director of the Northern Arizona Red Cross.

The Red Cross office has not yet heard back about the success of the Bradley's mission.
