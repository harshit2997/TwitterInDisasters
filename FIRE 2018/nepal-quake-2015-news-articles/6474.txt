Israelis on scene of latest Nepal trembler

This morning, after at least 16 people were killed and more than 800 injured in a magnitude 7.4 aftershock earthquake near Mount Everest, Israeli humanitarian aid volunteers still working in Nepal following the 7.8-magnitude trembler on April 25 are assessing how best to help.

“IsraAID’s emergency response team is on the ground monitoring the situation in vulnerable areas,” according to a statement from the organization.

“Phone networks are down, everyone is outside and afraid to come in,” reported Yotam Polizer, IsraAID’s head of mission in Nepal early Tuesday afternoon.

“I am worried for vulnerable neighborhoods like Gongabu, where our search-and-rescue team rescued [Krishna Devi] Krishnadevi last week [from the wreckage of a hotel]. The houses there are not sturdy, and many were damaged by the earthquake. We are on the way there now.”

IsraAID currently has medical and psychosocial teams giving assistance and distributing goods in Nepal, and will continue to coordinate with the Nepalese government, UN agencies and other organizations to respond to any new developments, Polizer added.

Rabbi Chezky Lifshitz of the Kathmandu Chabad House reportedly ran out with his first aid kit to help people trapped under buildings nearby.

The Israel Defense Forces field hospital was dismantled a couple of days ago and the medical crew landed back in Israel this morning.

“I know that you are always prepared for the next mission wherever it may be, and according to the news, that chance may be upon us,” said Prime Minister Netanyahu upon greeting the returning IDF team. “I said to the ambassador from Nepal a few minutes ago that we are ready to help with all our capabilities even now.”
