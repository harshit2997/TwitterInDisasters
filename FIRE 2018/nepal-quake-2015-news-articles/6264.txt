Missing Pendleton-based Marine helicopter working in Nepal reportedly spotted

A Camp Pendleton-based Marine UH-1Y Huey helping with relief work after Nepals recent earthquake was missing, officials from the U.S. Pacific Command said Tuesday.

Late Tuesday, the press agency Deutsche Presse-Agentur quoted an official as saying the aircraft had been spotted north of the capital of Kathmandu.

We have been told it was spotted in Tamakoshi region, north of Kathmandu, said Interior Ministry spokesman Laxmi Dhakal. But until (our) choppers make landing and get to it, we still cant say anything about its condition or of its passengers.

A UH-1 is an odd choice for high-altitude operations - just not enough lift to spare.

The UH-1Y is a twin engined, 4 bladed variant of the huey. It’s probably better at high altitude work than the earlier marks. CC

the UH1Y Yankee has been modified with 4 blade rotors and greatly improved twin engines , for use in Afghanistan etc.

Lift and range greatly improved



To: Celtic Conservative; LeoWindhorse

"...twin engined, 4 bladed variant..." I spoke too fast - I was thinking of the old 2-blade powered by the venerable Lycoming T-53.

Chinooks are probably the optimum rotary wing vehicle for high-altitude missions, but a) USMC doesn't fly them, and b) that's a lot of aircraft.

Prayers for the crew.
