A North Providence man is in Nepal as part of Plan International, one of the largest and oldest children's development organizations.

Frank Manfredi says when he arrived in Nepal just four days after the earthquake and subsequent avalanches on April 29th, he was in the midst of chaos.

"Parts of the city..buildings had collapsed in the streets and other places you could see where retaining walls and buildings and parts of buildings had collapsed and were damaged." He went on to say, "The interesting thing is how uneven it was. You'd have one street where entire buildings had collapsed in to the street and other places where you really couldn't tell that there had been any damage at all."

Manfredi says a lot of people are still sleeping outdoors. "Some, because their homes have been destroyed and others frankly because there's been some damage to their homes and they're afraid they're going to collapse if there's another aftershock."

Manfredi says priority number one for Plan International is getting emergency shelter kits and food packs to families.

"We have got clean water kits, hygiene kits so we're really right now in an initial life saving relief phase."

Longer term goals for his organization include bringing back a sense of normalcy--especially to the children--as their communities work to rebuild.

"It's very important for children who've been through these distressing events to have a sense of normalcy that comes from education and a safe place to play.
