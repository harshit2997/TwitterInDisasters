Nepal's foreign minister has thanked China for helping the recovery efforts in the earthquake-battered nation, which was left reeling after a second disaster hit yesterday.

Foreign Minister Mahendra Bahadur Pandey said China has done a "very good job" after it deployed an unprecedented number of military and police personnel to Nepal following the first earthquake, on April 25.

"We would like to extend our thanks to the Chinese people and the Chinese government," he said. "We appreciate the prompt response shown by Chinese President Xi Jinping , and we are very happy and it has encouraged us to move forward."

"In the devastating earthquake, thousands of the people lost lives in Nepal and thousands of people have been injured," Pandey said of the April 25 earthquake. "Hundreds of thousands of the people have been homeless. In this situation, the Chinese government and the Chinese people helped us with the humanitarian effort. They came and they have done a very good job."

China, India and the United States have sent helicopters and have been helping deliver food, water and shelter to the affected communities.

China deployed 1,088 military personnel and police to help with disaster relief - the largest aid mission undertaken by the People's Liberation Army and police forces, according to the PLA's General Staff Headquarters

"They have been helping us to provide food to the people who are suffering in different parts of our country," Pandey said.

China's Blue Sky Rescue Team, a non-governmental rescue organisation, wrapped up its mission in Nepal on Sunday.

The 83 volunteers, who paid for their own flights, brought with them rescue equipment and various supplies.
