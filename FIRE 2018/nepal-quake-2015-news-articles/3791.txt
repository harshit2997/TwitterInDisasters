VADODARA: The earthquake that ravaged Nepal has also shaken the travel plans of several Barodians, who wanted to visit the country in the lap of Himalayas for a summer vacation. Tourists from the city are planning their holidays afresh and looking at other destinations even as travel operators say that Nepal may not be a destination to look forward to for quite some time to come.Alpesh Jadhav, a resident of Karelibaug, was keenly waiting to visit Nepal in May with his family. But the earthquake has forced him to change his plans as his operator cancelled the tour which had around 60 tourists in all. "The operator is in a tight spot and one cannot blame him. At this juncture, I would rather pray for Nepal than worry about my cancelled tour," said Jadhav.Siddiq Gandhi from the Baroda Tours and Travels Association Trust said that his firm had to cancel the tours of seven families to Nepal. "There will be many others like me. Some may have even made group bookings with buses that would have been cancelled," he said.It is not just Nepal tours that have been affected by the earthquake. Gandhi said that even tours to Kailash-Mansarovar would be affected. "We use the route through Nepal for the pilgrimage. This year 12 persons from the city were to visit Kailash Mansarovar, but the tour was cancelled," he said.Jagdish Patel, a retired government employee, had made plans to go to Nepal essentially for a pilgrimage to visit the temple of Lord Pashupatinath. "All tours have been suspended for 10 days for now. But by experience in working during disasters, I know that it might be quite some time before things become normal again. I have already been given a refund by my tour operator," he said.
