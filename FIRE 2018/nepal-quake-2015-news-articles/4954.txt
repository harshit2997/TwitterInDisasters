OTTAWA -- An Ottawa woman who was trekking with friends in Nepal when the magnitude-7.8 earthquake struck last Saturday has returned home safely.

Faye Kennedy, 32, was travelling through Langtang National Park, to the north of the Kathmandu Valley, and was not heard from by her family for days after the quake.

Kennedy arrived safely in Ottawa from Nepal on Saturday and was welcomed home by her family.

A statement put out by family members says she is grateful to be alive and among loved ones again.

Kennedy also thanked social media users, media, fellow travellers, the Nepalese people and the Canadian government for their help in bringing attention to the disaster and getting her home safely.

Kennedy's family had said last week that after she was discovered alive she was airlifted to Kathmandu from the park due to injuries she sustained during the earthquake.
