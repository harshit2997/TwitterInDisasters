A meeting of the Central Natural Disaster Committee headed by Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Home Affairs Bam Dev Gautam on Sunday decided to send back foreign rescue and search experts.

“The meeting decided to send back all foreign teams as the search and rescue in the quake aftermath is almost over. Very few bodies are likely to remain in the rubble which our own security agencies are able to handle,” Home Ministry spokesman Laxmi Prasad Dhakal told the Post after the meeting.

After sending them off with appreciation and gratitude, only a few hundred foreign experts will stay back for relief distribution. The decision is forwarded to the Cabinet which will take a call possibly on Monday. As many as 4,050 experts from 34 countries have been helping in the past nine days.

They searched big structures for bodies, said Dhakal, adding that “our agencies are now capable to look through small structures”.

The government on April 25 had called the international community to dispatch their teams to Nepal. Now the decision to send them back needs Cabinet approval. A total of 129 sniffer dogs were also involved in search and rescue efforts. The international practice is that rescue teams leave the affected country within a week.
