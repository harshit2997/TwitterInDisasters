tibet quake death toll 18 china offers assistance to nepal

Beijing: The death toll in southwest China's Tibet Autonomous Region due to the devastating earthquake that hit Nepal climbed to 18 today as the Communist giant stepped up relief and rescue assistance to its neighbour.

The 7.9-magnitude quake that struck Nepal yesterday also affected parts of Tibet.

Some 7,000 people have been relocated in Nyalam County and about 5,000 in Gyirong county, some 800 km west to Lhasa.

The two border ports to Nepal were seriously affected.

The death toll in the earthquake in Tibet climbed to 18 with a total of 55 people injured, official media reported.

The highway linking Xigaze and the Zham Pass, the border port to Nepal, has been cut by landslides, state-run Xinhua news agency reported.

So far four people, including a Nepalese national, were missing in Nyalam.

About 80 tourists, including a dozen foreigners, were visiting the county when the earthquake struck.

The quake toppled 1,191 houses, damaged roads and cut telecommunications in Xigaze, where 54 temples were damaged.

A 5.9-magnitude aftershock shook Xigaze yesterday and a 5.3-magnitude quake jolted Nyalam County at 1:42 am today, China Earthquake Networks Centre recorded.

Weather forecasts predict continuous rain and snow in the area for the next few days.

Over 400 mountaineers from more than 20 countries on the Tibetan side of Mount Everest have descended or are descending to the north base camp at 5,200 meters with no casualties reported so far.

The central government has sent 5,000 tents, 30,000 coats, 30,000 comforters, 15,000 folding beds and 15,000 sleeping bags to the affected area.

The regional government has sent tents, coats, food, medicine and drinking water.

Tibet military command is helping with relief work.

"Aftershocks are our biggest worry at the moment, because there is nowhere to hide," said Gyanga Tseten, detachment head of Xigaze fire brigade, who is leading a 30-strong task force to Zham Pass about 37 km from Nyalam.

Telecommunication technicians are repairing the 66 base stations in Xigaze that stopped working during the earthquakes.

China today announced a 20 million yuan (USD 3.3 million) humanitarian aid to Nepal to deal with the massive earthquake that has killed over 2,350 people.

The aid, including supplies of tents, blankets and generators, will be delivered to Nepal by chartered planes, the Ministry of Commerce said.

China will offer further support according to Nepal's demands, it said.
