</headline>

<text>
Bengaluru, April 27: We posted a story on how young surgeons are heading to Nepal for serving the victims. While you can join them as volunteers, there are other ways of helping the people in Nepal too. While the Indian Airforce is doing its best to help evacuate the people of Nepal, we can do our share of contributing.

Film stars and celebrities like Shekhar Kapoor and Katy Perry shared links of UNICEF where you could donate any amount for the Nepal children's relief fund. Actress Dia MIrza has started her own campaign at the ketto.org to raise funds for the earthquake victims.

According to the UNICEF, close to 1 million children have been affected by the Nepal earthquake that hit the state on Saturday at a Richter scale of 7.9. UNICEF justifies that these children are in dire need of basic humanitarian assistance. The agency also reports that there are dwindling supplies of water, electricity and communication network. In these conditions, children are vulnerable to waterborne diseases, apart from being separated from their families.

Many international government agencies are also helping the people of Nepal with their donation campaigns. For instance, USAID CIDI, is an education organization that helps in public donations in support of disaster relief. Created by the U.S. Agency for International Development in 1988, USAID CIDI works with the Office of U.S. Foreign Disaster Assistance (USAID/OFDA), which leads and coordinates the U.S. Government's humanitarian assistance efforts overseas.

The World Food Programme has also launched an online donation campaign to fight hunger. You can visit their site and donate generously.

Telecom and social networking sites too have made contributions in their own way. Viber, for instance, has announced free calls to Nepalese mobile and landline numbers. On April 25th, Airtel issued a statement on its Twitter account saying that it has decided to offer all calls from India to Nepal on the Airtel network free of cost for the next 48 hours.
