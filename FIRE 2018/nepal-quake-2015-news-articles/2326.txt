The country known for its Himalayan Mountains is suffering after three earthquakes ripped across the area.

In Nepal, more than 2,500 are dead after devastating earthquakes destroyed areas.

Saturday's 7.8 earthquake demolished areas near the capitol, Kathmandu spreading to smaller villages and hitting Mount Everest which caused an avalanche that covered part of the base camp.

Aftershocks of 6.7 and 5.3 magnitudes shook the ground Sunday.

Nepali students at Westminster College have started a relief fund to help with people and areas affected.

Their families are living in Nepal and they first had trouble getting in contact with them.

Tripti Giri, Student from Nepal "We all tried to call or contact whoever we could in the family to make sure they were safe and the network wasn't that good because um because the country wasn't quite prepared for this and we don't really have a lot of disaster preparedness in place."

Giri describes that her family and many other Nepalese are sleeping tents and in open spaces away from buildings.



"There's this one phone call that I had and my mom just started shouting for everyone to come out she's like it's going on right now and I창??m just like on the phone on this side I창??m thinking oh my god you all are going through this it's very scary," explains Giri.

Sherijan Amatya, who is also a Westminster student from Nepal says, 창??The most important thing is humanitarian need like they need immediate support food and water supply...now it's raining so a spread of disease is going to take place."

They both said that their families are doing as well as they can, but the most important thing is that they are all alive.





Giri and Amatya창??s families are from Katmandu.





The Nepali students on campus have started a go fund me relief fund and are asking for any monetary donation possible.

They plan to donate the money raised to areas in Nepal that need it most.

They also are having a clothing donation drive to send over to the Himalayan nation as well.

Medical supplies, sleeping bags and tents are also among many supplies that can also be donated to the clothing drive.The students say anything you can offer to help out the people affected in Nepal will be greatly appreciated.
