"We have successfully contacted 48 of 76 Indonesians in Nepal. We haven't been able to reach the other 16 and the other 12 are safe and they are already out of Nepal," Foreign Affairs Minister Retno Marsudi told Tempo.co on Wednesday. Nineteen of the 76 Indonesians were residents in Nepal.

The National Disaster Mitigation Agency (BNBP) announced on Tuesday two rescue teams would be flown to Nepal via a military-owned Hercules and a Garuda Indonesia Airbus.

The first team left Halim Perdanakusuma Airport in East Jakarta this morning, while a second group would leave at 4 p.m.

“We want to not only save Indonesians in Nepal, but also help other nationals living near Indonesia, like Singaporeans and Malaysians,” the BNPB’s “Indonesia Peduli Nepal” secretary Junjung S. Tambunan told detik.com.

Nepal is yet to fully assess the damage of Saturday's quake, but Prime Minister Sushil Koirala has told Reuters the death toll could reach 10,000, with information on casualties and damage from far-flung villages and towns yet to come in.

An official from Nepal's home ministry said the number of confirmed deaths had risen to 5,006. Almost 10,000 were injured in Nepal, and more than 80 were also killed in India and Tibet.

In the capital Kathmandu and other cities, hospitals quickly overflowed with injured soon after the quake, with many being treated out in the open or not at all.
