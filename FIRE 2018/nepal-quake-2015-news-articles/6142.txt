A Snohomish County firefighter spent the last two weeks providing disaster assistance in Nepal. He just got home on Sunday, but because of another major earthquake in that country, he's now headed right back.

Chris Tompkins has spent decades working as both a firefighter and a medic.

After the 2010 earthquake in Haiti, he helped found a non-profit called Clarion Global Response. The organization has allowed him and a team of volunteers to provide disaster assistance all over the world.

When he arrived home from Nepal, Tompkins shared photos and videos of his most recent response with KING 5.

"The people are really grateful for the help that's coming in," he said. "And we're happy to help."

So when he learned there had been another major earthquake in Nepal that killed dozens of people and brought down more buildings in a still-struggling country, Tompkins knew he could not stay home for long.

He quickly began putting together another team, and plans to fly out of Seattle on Wednesday, bound once again for Nepal. He said it's something he felt compelled to do. In fact, it is the meaning behind the non-profit he helped start.

"That's what a Clarion is, it's a call to action or a summons to respond," he said. "And the people there are very resilient, they just need the resources to go along with it."

Tompkins hopes to spend about a week in Nepal this time around, and then come back home for some well-deserved rest and time with family.

He says his team's disaster relief efforts will continue long after that, with other members of the rotating in and out over the coming weeks and months.
