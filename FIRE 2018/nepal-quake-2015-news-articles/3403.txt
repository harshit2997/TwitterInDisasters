KATHMANDU, April 27 -- Nepal has called on foreign countries, including neighboring China and India, to provide more support as tens and thousands of people are in dire need of relief and support following a massive 7.9-magnitude earthquake on Saturday and following strong aftershocks.

During a meeting with over two dozen Kathmandu-based ambassadors and diplomats, on Monday, Nepal's Foreign Minister Mahendra Bahadur Pandey sought more support, medical and rescue teams from their respective countries.

"The minister informed the diplomats about the situation of Nepal following the major devastating earthquakes," Spokesperson of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Tara Prasad Pokharel told Xinhua.

According to Pokharel, the minister expressed thanks to the ambassadors and their respective countries for ongoing support and also requested for more support in the rescue operation.

Meanwhile, blood donation programs were being held in the capital of Kathmandu to collect blood for the survivors of the disaster. However, the demand of blood from the hospitals in past two days is lower than the general demand, according to Red Cross.

Nepal has a storage of 800 units of blood in the blood bank that is sufficient following Saturday's powerful earthquake, the Nepal Red Cross Society's Central Blood Transfusion Service said on Monday.

Death toll from the devastating quake has risen to 3,726, including 931 in Kathmandu, and 6,944 others were injured, according to the Home Ministry.
