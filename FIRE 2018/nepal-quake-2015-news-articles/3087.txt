MELBOURNE, AUSTRALIA--(Marketwired - Apr 28, 2015) - Following the devastating earthquake in Nepal, Intrepid Travel's not-for-profit, The Intrepid Foundation, launched a Nepal fundraising appeal. With over 30 years of experience in the region the adventure travel company, Intrepid Travel has strong ties to the destination and the people, leading to the overwhelming response from travelers in the first 36 hours. With more than $50,000AUD ($39,277USD) received within the first 24 hours of the launch, the foundation has now raised $70,000AUD ($54,991USD) to date.

Intrepid offered to match traveler donations dollar-for-dollar to assist with emergency relief in Nepal, and originally set a target of $40,000AUD ($31,422USD) for the appeal. Intrepid has now announced that it will match traveler donations up to a target of $200,000AUD ($157,100USD) -- with The Intrepid Foundation contributing up to $100,000AUD ($78,563USD) to the appeal.

"The situation in Nepal is heartbreaking. This is a part of the world that is close to the hearts of many of us, and we knew that like us -- travelers will want to help," says James Thornton, Managing Director of Intrepid Travel. "We want to raise as much as possible for local families in Kathmandu, and so by matching donations dollar-for-dollar we are encouraging people to give generously."

The appeal is raising funds for Plan International, a long-term partner of The Intrepid Foundation. The children's charity has been working in Nepal for more than 30 years to help impoverished children to access, health, education and protection. Plan International has sent emergency teams to respond to the needs of children and families affected by the earthquake in the Kathmandu Valley, with the immediate priority of supporting children's core needs of shelter, water, health care, and essential child protection mechanisms.

All donations will go directly to Plan International with any administration costs entirely funded by Intrepid.
