The Indian Air Force on Tuesday evacuated 19 mountaineers from Lukla in Nepal as part of its relief and rescue operations in the Himalayan country in wake of the devastating earthquake.

External affairs ministry spokesperson Vikas Swarup tweeted: "19 mountaineers were evacuated today from Lukla by IAF helicopters."

Lukla, considered a gateway for the Mount Everest region, is now serving as the rescue base for mountaineers.

Ove 4,600 people are already confirmed dead in Nepal from Saturday's 7.9 magnitude temblor.

A defence ministry release said that IAF has airlifted 2,865 people and landed 238.5 tonnes of relief material and equipment in Nepal.

IAF has used C-17 Globemaster III, IL-76, C130J Super Hercules and AN-32 aircraft in the rescue and relief efforts. It has also positioned eight medium lift helicopters (MLH) in the Himalayan nation.

"A total of 250 casualties have been evacuated by the helicopters," the release said.
