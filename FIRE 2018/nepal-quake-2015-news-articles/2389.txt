According to the latest information coming in from Nepal over 3218 people are known to have died and over 6500 are injured after a major earthquake, whose intensity on the Richter scale was of 7.8, hit the country's capital city Kathmandu on April 25. Then again on yesterday an aftershock of 6.7 intensity jolted Kathmandu. So far 83 aftershocks have been felt here in the capital city and adjoining areas creating panic among the residents, who are fleeing to the safer zones now.

People in Kathmandu are spending sleepless nights without any shelter. Those whose houses are safe are prefering to spend their nights outside their houses. The sick and wounded are lying in the open as all the hospitals are short of beds. Doctors are treating them inside tents.

India has stepped up rescue efforts for the Nepal earthquake victims. The operation is named as 'Operation Maitri'. A large amount of relief material has been sent to the Nepal by air. Teams of India's National Disaster Response Force (NDRF) are working day and night in Kathmandu to rescue people stuck under the debris. A medical contingent of civilian doctors have been also sent to Kathmandu with two tonnes of medical supplies.

An inter-ministerial team in India, headed by Additional Secretary in MHA BK Prasad, has left for Nepal to coordinate rescue and relief operations.

International rescue teams and relief supplies are also reaching Nepal's devastated capital. Equipped with heavy cutting gear and accompanied by sniffer dogs, rescue teams from countries like China are landing round-the-clock at the country's only international airport on the outskirts of Kathmandu.

Meanwhile Indian Met Department has predicted heavy rains in Kathmandu in next 48 hours. If it happens the rescue ops are set to be hampered.
