The bodies of around 100 trekkers and villagers have been found at the site of a remote village in Nepal 40 miles north of Kathmandu.

Officials say the bodies were under snow and ice from an avalanche set off by last week's earthquake.

The dead includes at least seven foreigners

Meanwhile, 63 tonnes of Irish Aid have arrived in Nepal.

The delivery which arrived last night contains essential items including thousands of blankets, tents and water.

More than 7,000 people have died so far - and Gareth Owen from Save the Children estimates that a million youngsters have been affected.
