The Rescue Brigade Topos México Tlatelolco has started a fundraising campaign to be able to join rescue efforts there after a 7.8 magnitude earthquake shook Nepal last Saturday, leaving more than 4,000 people death and 7,000 injured.

The group was born when volunteers spontaneously showed up to help in the aftermath of 1985 Mexico City earthquake. The group was formally organized as a civil association in February 1986 and for more than three decades, they have assisted rescue and recovery efforts in the Mexican states of Tabasco, Chiapas, Oaxaca, State of Mexico, Veracruz and Mexico City, and in countries all over the world including Haiti, Indonesia, El Salvador and Chile.

Topos México doesn't receive any payment for their work since it is entirely based on volunteers. Most of the time, local authorities or Mexico's federal government cover their travel expenses and the countries they go give them visas and access to the disaster zones.

The following video shows a summary of the Topos’ work.
