Bihar minister Ramai Ram quits relief role after Nitish 'insult'
</headline>

<text>
Slighted over the appointment of a Cabinet colleague as coordinator for the earthquake relief and rescue operations in Bihar, a senior minister in the Nitish Kumar government has resigned as the incharge of the bordering district of East Champaran.

Ramai Ram, the minister for transport and SC-ST welfare, said he felt insulted after CM Nitish Kumar gave the responsibility to another minister even though he was taking care of the implementation of the 20-point programme in the East Champaran district.

On Tuesday, Nitish had appointed Water Resources Minister Vijay Nitish Chouhdhary as the coordinator for the relief operations at Raxaul, the border town along Nepal, which falls in East Champaran. However, the move raised the hackles of Ram, who wrote to the chief minister, expressing his anguish over the decision and tendered his resignation.

The minister, however, did not resign from the Cabinet and chose to quit only as the in-charge of the district.

In his letter, Ram said Nitish could have removed him and appointed somebody else had he been incompetent, but "the decision was taken without even consulting me". Ram also said he felt all the more insulted because he believed that he had been discharging his responsibilities rather efficiently.

However, Nitish brushed aside Ram's resignation, saying such politics would not be tolerated in the time of calamity. "I will not waste even a moment to accept the resignation, if anybody quits in the time of calamity," Nitish said in Patna on Thursday.
