GREEN BAY - A Fond du Lac hospice nurse stranded at a Mt. Everest climbing camp for days after an earthquake rocked south Asian region is slowly making his way back home. But it could be at least one week before he’s back in Wisconsin.Andy Land, 53, called FOX 11’s Bill Miston late Thursday evening (about 8:00 a.m. Central Time) from a hilltop about 20 miles from Everest Base Camp."I feel that long ago, I learned that the summit is promised to no one. There's no guarantee of anything. So it's the experience that matters the most," said Land, adding the experience has changed his life.Land left for Nepal last month and was on his way up the mountain when Saturday’s earthquake struck. The 7.8 magnitude tremor and aftershocks have claimed at least 3,700 lives in the small south Asian country."There was a whiteout at the time, so we couldn't see anything, The earth started rumbling and the mother of all avalanches was coming down on all sides of us, and basically you just sitting in a tent waiting to die."The tremor and subsequent aftershocks destroyed the normally dangerous Khumbu Icefall route to base camp, stranding Land and about 100 climbers on the mountain for several days."It was really scary and then not knowing – the ability to be evacuated was all dependent on the weather,” he said. “We could have been stuck there a week or ten days."When the weather cleared Monday, he was evacuated by helicopter to base camp. That’s where he came face to face with the devastation caused by an avalanche that swept through the campsite, killing 19 people and injuring many more."But when we got to base camp, what we saw was people – it was like a war zone."Dead bodies; campsites and equipment strewn about."You're stunned, you're really shocked. I'm really trying to come to terms with all of this, what does it mean?"Land left Everest Base Camp with his expedition group Wednesday morning on their way to Nepal's capital, Kathmandu – a ten day hike. The hope is to hike for several days to the city of Lukla and catch a flight. Land called me from a small mountain village about 20 miles away from basecamp."We're totally relying on ourselves for water and cooking and we're camping out right now. It's probably 20 degrees and standing on a hilltop outside this little village called Phortse, because that's the only way to get a cell signal to call you."Land says it could be at least one week before he can get a flight out of Nepal.
