Ford Fund and Ford employees lined up to contribute more than $200,000 for disaster relief in Nepal.By now the whole world knows what happened in Nepal on April 25, when a 7.8 magnitude earthquake caused severe destruction in the entire region. The initial wave was followed by a powerful aftershock, itself registering 6.7Mw, the very next day.So far, there have been a lot of organizations involved with the relief fund, and private individuals as well. Caring gestures have also come via the automotive industry, where Honda GM and Mahindra & Mahindra did their part to help out Nepal's government with funds as well as equipment.Ford Motor Company Fund delegated $50,000 towards the 'Global Giving' disaster relief fund, with an additional $50,000 in employee donations.Ford Fund also gave $100,000 to Habitat for Humanity International in order to help Ford Asia Pacific better contribute to local rebuilding efforts.Jim Vella, Ford Fund president said thatHopefully their donations, as well as those of other companies and individuals will go a long way in helping the people of Nepal and all those affected by the disaster.
