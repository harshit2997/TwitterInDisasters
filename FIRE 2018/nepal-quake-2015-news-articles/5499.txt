Immediately after recovering from a road accident near Shivamogga, Vani Kori, an obstetrician and gynaecologist from the city, headed to earthquake-hit Nepal to help the victims.

“I was bedridden for more than a month after the accident. The suffering and pain of the victims in Nepal, which I saw on TV made me relate to the pain. As a doctor, I felt I should help them. When the State government and the Indian Medical Association directed me to head to Nepal, I immediately got ready for the assignment,” she said.

A team of 10 medical experts left Bengaluru on April 27 and reached the next day owing to busy air traffic in Kathmandu. The Indian Embassy in Kathmandu is doing an excellent work in assisting the victims, she said.

On April 29, the medical team served at various camps in Kathmandu city. Later, they worked in remote places in Sindhupal Chowk, Ramkot, and Gorkha districts.

As roads were damaged in the earthquake, it was a challenge to reach remote villages. Each doctor treated a minimum of 500 patients a day, she said. Ms. Kori, who is back in Shivamogga, said that along with providing treatment, the doctors had to counsel the patients and instil confidence in them. As a doctor, the suffering of pregnant women moved me the most. I salute the spirit of motherhood of the Nepalese women, she added.
