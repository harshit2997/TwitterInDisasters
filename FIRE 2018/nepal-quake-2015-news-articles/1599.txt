UNL Students Raise Money for Nepal Earthquake Victims
</headline>

<text>
The death toll in Nepal continues to rise and the destruction grows after an earthquake hit the country Saturday. As aftershocks and search parties continue, students here in Nebraska said they can't just sit idle.

Several Nepalese students now call the University of Nebraska - Lincoln campus home, but the home that's in their hearts is Nepal. Instead of dwelling on what's happened there, they want to make a difference and that's what they did Sunday.

Prabhakar Shrestha said he couldn't sleep much Saturday night, thinking of his wife and sibling back home in Nepal.

"I woke up in the morning and said I have to do something, you know, whatever it is," Shrestha said, who works as a sustainability coordinator at UNL.

Shrestha called fellow Nepalese students to the UNL Union Sunday to brainstorm ways to help, when the help came to him.

"When I got here, I saw all these empty tables and wanted to know what it was and I just talked to the organizer and said 'Hey, can we have a table of our own so that we can raise some funds?" Shrestha said. "She said 'Is that all I have to do?' and I said 'Yes.'"

Students from several countries set up booths at the 2015 Culture Shock event. Instead of sharing their culture, Nepalese students asked others to revive it by donating anything they could to victims in need.

"That's our main goal right now, just to make sure that we have enough money to get supplies, medicine, clothing, shelter all the way over there in Nepal," UNL Student Neha Dixit said.

Thousands of miles away, the destruction and tragedy is hard for some students to accept.

"Looking at pictures, it doesn't look real to us because we are not [there,] UNL Graduate Student Pranav Shakya said. "I know people there are like suffering more than us right now, but still we are just trying to make sense of what's happening. I think that's been difficult for us."

Nepalese students said it's hard not being able to be with their families or even talk to them. However, here in Nebraska they're lifting each other up.

"We're all worried," Shrestha said. "Don't know what to do, so when I see them and when they see me and when we are together, [it's] just bonding."

The Nepalese Students Association plans to hold a candlelight vigil at UNL Thursday to remember the more than 2,700 victims. Members also said they plan to continue fundraising in the coming days.
