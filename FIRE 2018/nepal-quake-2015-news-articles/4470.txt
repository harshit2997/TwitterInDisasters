No Bulgarian citizens, who are currently in Nepal, expressed interest to evacuate from the earthquake-stricken country with the airplane, which has been provided for the purpose by the Foreign Ministry.

This was announced by the ministry's spokesperson Betina Zhoteva in an interview for private NOVA TV on Wednesday.

The Foreign Ministry announced on Tuesday that Bulgarians wishing to evacuate from Nepal have to board a Spanish airplane, which was due to take off at 8:00 a.m. local time on Wednesday.

All Bulgarians, who have contacted the ministry or the Bulgarian embassy in Delhi, expressed preference to travel with their initially scheduled flights.

Zhoteva reaffirmed that no Bulgarians were suffering from the disaster and assured that the ministry had contacted all fellow citizens in Nepal.

The Bulgarians preferred to travel with the Turkish Airlines flight, which they deemed as more convenient.

The group of twelve mountaineers, who had initially requested evacuation, changed their mind and decided to take instead their initially scheduled flight.

Nepal declared three-day national mourning for the victims of the disastrous earthquake, which hit the country on Saturday, as the death toll surpassed 5000 people.
