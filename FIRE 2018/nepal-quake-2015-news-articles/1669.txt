National Conference president Dr Farooq Abdullah on Sunday expressed grief and shock over the devastating earthquake in Nepal and asked India to extend all possible assistance to Nepal to deal with this situation.

"My heart goes out to those who have been affected by this devastating tragedy. The images and stories coming out of Nepal and various Indian states that have been affected are heart rending. This is a major calamity that has not only taken a very serious toll on human lives in the affected regions but has also shattered public infrastructure and hundreds and thousands of residential houses in the region. May Allah help the people to survive this calamity and may He give them the courage and resilience to re-emerge and re-build their lives," Dr Farooq Abdullah said in a statement issued from NC headquarters in Srinagar.

"I asked the government to ensure all possible assistance and help to Nepali citizens working in J&K to get in touch with their families back home. I also expect the government to reach out to all Kashmiri traders and businessmen working in Nepal and facilitate their identification, rescue and return to their families in Kashmir," said Abdullah.

He said there are a lot of Kashmiri families who are going through unimaginable anxiety on account of not being able to get in touch with their near and dear ones in Nepal. "The state government should approach the ministry of external affairs and set up special cells both in J&K as well as in Delhi to monitor the welfare of J&K residents in Nepal," he said.
