Nepal dealing with aftermath of earthquake
</headline>

<text>
More than 25 hundred people have died in the earthquake that rocked the Himalayan country of Nepal over the weekend.

Survivors dealt with at least 30 aftershocks as they tried to rescue people from the rubble of fallen buildings.

And as scenes of the disaster reached Canada, Nepalese communities here met to plan a way to help.

So far the government has pledged $5 million and the help of the Disaster Assistance Response Team, which was deployed after disasters in the Philippines and Haiti.
