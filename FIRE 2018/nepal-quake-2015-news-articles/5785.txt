ON A MISSION: Local Bangalow doctor Bronwyn Hudson is heading over to Nepal to assist with medical relief efforts in the devastated area. Marc Stapelberg

I am an editor with a broad range of interests including well-being, the environment, politics, lifestyle issues, social trends, sex and relationships and community. I am also a qualified counsellor and permaculturist, a dog lover and a yogi. I have written two books, Sex, Optimism and Surviving the 21st Century (Harper Collins) and Slow Sydney (Affirm Press). I love new ideas and people who think outside the box . I enjoy working in a close-knit community.

A BANGALOW mum will tackle the devastation caused by the Nepalese earthquake head on when she leaves Australia tomorrow.

Bronwyn Hudson, a local GP, will provide emergency medical relief as part of an aid effort co-ordinated by International Medical Relief, an organisation based in Colorado in the United States.

Dr Kevin Hartley, from Byron Bay Hospital, will also travel with her, as well as registered nurse Theresa Missiaen, who also works at the hospital.

The teams are made up of doctors, nurses, paramedics and logisticians who are self funded and take their own supplies including tents, food and water, bedding, equipment and medicines so as not to drain already scarce resources.

"It's impossible to see the destruction and suffering and not be stirred to contribute," she said.

In only two days, Dr Hudson has been able to raise more than $9,000 towards the trip thanks to donations from friends and family.

"I'm blown away by the generosity and support of my family, friends and the local Bangalow community."

The single mother-of-two initially went to Nepal as part of AUSAID's Youth Ambassadors for Development program in 2002.

Inspired to study medicine, she ended up staying to work on a project for the International Labour Organisation of the United Nations while preparing for medical school entry exams.

She also she met the father of her children in Nepal - he was a diplomat with British Foreign Office.

"Our eldest daughter is called 'Maya' which means 'love' in Nepali."

While she worked in a number of Kathmandu hospitals as a medical student, she has never done emergency disaster relief and admits she's nervous.

"But I feel the love and support of all those who believe in me and believe in this mission."

Dr Hudson, holds a Bachelors Degree in Medicine and Surgery with honours and a diploma in child health, from the University of Sydney.

Those who would like to contribute to her trip can go to http://www.gofundme.com/t5ghs6x or cash donations can be delivered to Bangalow Medical Centre.
