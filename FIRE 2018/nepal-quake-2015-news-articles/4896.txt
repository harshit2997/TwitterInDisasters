Salisbury search-and-rescue team returns after Nepal earthquake mission
</headline>

A SPECIALIST team led by a Salisbury firefighter has returned from its rescue mission in Nepal.

The eight volunteers of Serve On are recovering today after spending five days searching for survivors in the aftermath of a powerful magnitude-7.9 earthquake that struck last Saturday, killing 6,600 people and injuring 14,000.

Salisbury station manager Dan Cooke's team scoured remote areas for survivors alongside the UK International Search and Rescue Team (ISAR), feeding vital information to the United Nations teams co-ordinating the aid effort.

They also worked with British Gurkhas in Nepal (BGN), and Serve On medic Peter Old said: “We were hugely impressed with the way that the BGN have provided emergency shelter and support for hundreds of people from many countries — residents and visitors to Nepal who were made homeless by the earthquake."

Serve On also donated lifesaving technical search equipment to the BGN to help them in their future response to disasters.

At the Salisbury headquarters, volunteers replaced and re-packed essential equipment over the weekend, ready for the next emergency, and are fundraising to cover the costs of the deployment.

Friends and family are relieved to be reunited with the team, who return to work tomorrow.

Serve On ambassador Joanna Lumley said: “I am so pleased and proud that Serve On International Response Team acted so fast.

"With precious skills and equipment needed in the search and rescue effort in Nepal you truly make the difference between life and death for those trapped.

"Be the outstretched hand that reaches for them in the darkness and donate now, please.”

Serve On is close to raising its target of £10,000 to cover the costs of its mission.

A spokesman for the charity said: "We receive no funding from the Disasters Emergency Committee and, as a small charity, are incredibly grateful for the support and donations from the public."

Serve On thanked Tesco and Waitrose in Salisbury for allowing volunteers to collect money at their supermarkets.
