The city unit of Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) has decided to raise funds to aid the victims of the massive earthquake that hit Nepal on Saturday and claimed more than 2,500 lives and destroyed private and public property.

Talking to mediapersons here on Monday, BJP city President Ujwala Badavanache said that the party expected to raise Rs. 1.50 lakh. She appealed to the people to contribute generously to help the victims. The party workers would open a stall to receive donations from the public at Dharmveer Sambhaji Chowk (Bogarves) in the city on Tuesday.

She stressed that BJP could be trusted as being a ‘party with difference’ and the funds collected from public would be sent to the central unit of the party, from where the funds would be sent to Nepal.
