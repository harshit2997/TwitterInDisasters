KATHMANDU, Nepal – As the death toll from Nepal’s massive earthquake passed 4,200 Monday, survivors of the disaster in the capital struggled with shortages of electricity, gasoline, water, cash and sanitary facilities. Phone and Internet links remained spotty at best.

Nepalese authorities estimated that the number of dead could surpass 8,000 and said the tally of injured stood at more than 7,500.

Forty-eight hours after the huge temblor, rescue and relief workers had yet to reach numerous remote mountain villages. Reports from some hamlets suggested that, in some areas, 70 percent or more of the homes had been reduced to heaps of rubble.

Schools, most businesses and banks were closed, and ATMs lacked electricity to dispense cash. Long lines of motorcycles and cars formed at gas stations that had fuel.

Nepal is prone to earthquakes, but Finance Minister Ram Sharan Mahat acknowledged that the government wasn’t prepared to respond to a disaster of this scale. “Our system wasn’t prepared to fix a problem of this magnitude, but the government is doing the best it can with the resources at our disposal,” said Mahat. “All our helicopters are occupied with the rescue, so it is difficult to fly the relief materials to remote areas.”

Chief Secretary Leela Mani Paudel said at a news conference that Nepal urgently needs tents, medical teams specialized in orthopedics, and collapsed-structure rescue and search teams. Minister of Information Minendra Rijal said 308 people had been rescued by helicopters and that authorities were trying to send more helicopters into remote areas.

Sanjeev Bikram Rana, executive director of the Katmandu Water Supply Management Board, said the entire Katmandu Valley was reeling from drinking water shortages due to power cuts and severe damage to pipes. “We are now working … to providg safe drinking water to people who have been taking refuge in the open areas around the valley,” he said.

By late Monday, the death toll in Nepal stood at 4,264, according to the country’s Ministry of Home Affairs.

Four Americans were reported to be among at least 17 people killed when an avalanche triggered by the earthquake roared through a base camp used by climbers preparing to scale Mount Everest. The State Department on Monday confirmed the identities of two of them, Thomas Taplin and Vinh Truong.
