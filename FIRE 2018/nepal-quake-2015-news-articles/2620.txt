Triad Nepalese Community to Help Nepal Earthquake Victims
</headline>

<text>
GREENSBORO—Some Triad Nepalese Community Center members met Monday in High Point after one of the worst earthquakes in decades shook Nepal over the weekend.

A 7.8 magnitude earthquake along with aftershocks rocked the capital and countryside.

"We have been feeling so helpless,” Prashim Poudyal said.

More than 4,000 people are confirmed dead. Poudyal said his immediate family is OK but those in the rubble are trying to survive.

"People out there, they're not able to get into their home, they're scared to get into their home, they're living in a tent including my family,” he said.

The Triad Nepalese Community Center plans to hold a candlelight vigil for the victims this week. They’ve also set up a relief fund and will choose an organization to receive the money. To donate, visit their facebook page or call 336-707-0592.
