Helicopter mission gets stuck tourists out of Everest area; mother of one tourist gets panicked message from mountain-locked daughter.

Rescue crews of the Israeli insurance agency Harel succeeded on Monday in locating and rescuing four Israeli tourists who were stuck at high altitudes in the Nepalese mountains near Mount Everest following Saturday's disastrous earthquake.

The four were defined as being in healthy condition, and were transported to the town of Lukla in India after being located with satellite coordinates and extracted from the mountains via helicopter.

The Everest area was hard hit by an avalanche at the time of the quake that was caught on film in dramatic video footage.

On Monday, Foreign Ministry Director-General Nissim Ben-Shitrit met with the families of Israeli tourists still stranded in Nepal.

At the end of the meeting, Sharon Shavit, the mother of Shahar who is stuck in the area of Nepal's frozen lakes, said "we as parents are really worried, and would like to thank the Foreign Ministry for its actions for our children."

Shavit explained that they are not pressing the Foreign Ministry, but rather the Nepalese government to allow helicopters in to save their children.

She describe how she received a text message from her daughter, reading "we have with us someone wounded in the head, whose wound is starting to get infected."

"We can't stay here, there are cliffs on all sides and all the time there are avalanches, every few minutes. It's impossible to stay here, it's very dangerous. We can't move, all of the paths are blocked," read the message.

A source in the Foreign Ministry said that roughly 100 Israelis are currently still defined as being out of contact, meaning they have yet to be accounted for.

The number of people killed in the earthquake has already risen to over 3,726, as bodies continue to be found amid the massive rubble.

Saturday's earthquake measured a whopping 7.6 on the Richter scale, and since it struck no less than 83 aftershocks measuring at least 4 on the scale had ravaged the country of 28 million people by Monday morning.

One aftershock reached as high as 6.9 on Sunday afternoon, with over 200 minor tremors under 4 on the scale giving expression to the great tectonic unrest in the region.
