A medical team from Shanghaiâ€™s Huashan Hospital and the General Hospital of Armed Police Forces arrived in Nepal this afternoon. They will work in quake-hit areas for 10 days, providing both medical and psychological support.

Birendra Kumar Sah says he couldn't sleep last night. The 38-year-old Nepalese doctor has been a general surgeon at Shanghai's Ruijin Hospital for 11 years. He got his PhD at Jiaotong University's school of medicine, and later married a Shanghainese wife, who is also a doctor. Sah says due to a late night shift, he didn't know about the quake until his mother called him from Nepal.

But Sah says he won't have time to meet his mother, due to the huge number of injured people to be treated. He left Shanghai together with three experts from Huashan Hospital's respiratory, orthopedics and infectious disease departments, as well as two ICU nurses.

Sah says he can also help deal with language barriers. Apart from Nepali, he speaks Chinese as well as a little English. In fact, this is not the first time that Huashan Hospital's Red Cross medical team has taken part in international rescue. In 2013, the team went to the Philippines after typhoon Haiyan hit the country.

Then team also took along daily necessities, communication and field survival equipment, and medicine.

Huashan Hospital says a second batch of ten experts is ready to set off. They say after the basic rescue work is finished, they will try to reduce the disability and mortality rate of the severely injured people.
