MANILA, Philippines–The Philippines has expressed its sympathies to the government of Nepal and its people over the “terrible loss” of lives and massive destruction of property following the 7.9-magnitude earthquake that struck the south Asian country on April 25.

“During these most difficult times, the Philippines and the Filipino people stand in solidarity with our brothers and sisters in Nepal. We share the pain and anguish caused by this natural calamity,” the Department of Foreign Affairs (DFA) said in a statement.

The DFA said the government and Filipinos joined the international community in supporting Nepal’s efforts “to recover the survivors, rehabilitate lives and rebuild communities.”

“The Philippines stands ready to provide humanitarian, financial and other assistance to Nepal,” the DFA said.

Malacañang said a team from the Philippine Embassy in New Delhi was flying to Nepal shortly to address the needs of Filipinos affected by the earthquake.

In a statement, the Palace on Monday said the government will be coordinating with its counterparts in Nepal to provide the necessary assistance.

“Time and again, the world has come together to render assistance in times of dire need. Filipinos from all walks of life have likewise expressed sympathy and offered prayers for the Nepalese people. Nations of goodwill have pledged aid in all forms as Nepal engages in the work of rescue and recovery,” the statement said, quoting President Aquino.

Meanwhile, the Philippine Red Cross (PRC) on Monday urged Filipinos to assist the victims of the deadly quake by responding to the global appeal launched by the Nepal Red Cross through the International Federation of Red Cross (IFRC) and Red Crescent Societies.

“The PRC is appealing to our kababayan here and abroad to donate in cash for the Nepal Red Cross to and through the PRC for support to the most vulnerable people of Nepal,” PRC chair Richard Gordon said in a statement.

Gordon said it was the country’s turn to help after it received assistance from the international community when Supertyphoon “Yolanda” ravaged Eastern Visayas in November 2013.

Gordon said the agency was initially sending water and sanitation teams to Kathmandu but it will also deploy rescue and emergency field hospital experts to the disaster area soon.
