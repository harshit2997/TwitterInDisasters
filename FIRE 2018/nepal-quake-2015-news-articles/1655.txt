SALT LAKE CITY -- Relief teams from all over the world are aiding those impacted by the recent earthquake in Nepal, and groups in Utah are contributing to the cause with fundraising efforts and prayers on behalf of those in the area.

The United States is sending search and rescue workers to Nepal as well as a million dollars in aid. Locally, the Nepalese Association of Utah held an open meeting Sunday with members talking about the need for donations.

Many who attended said their families back home have lost their houses and belongings, and some can’t even contact their parents to make sure they're OK.

“It’s very emotional yeah, and I tried to call them, it doesn’t connect--but they are safe, you know,” said Romika Maharjan, the secretary for the Nepalese Association of Utah.

The association has set up a Paypal account and is accepting donations of any amount. The money will then be given to the Red Cross to help the people in Nepal.

Another group, The Utah Tibetan Community, held a prayer service for the earthquake victims Sunday.

Members the organization gathered together to offer their support and dedicate their prayers to the people suffering as a result of the natural disaster.

“The devastation you cannot imagine, the loss of lives and the infrastructure and right now thousands of people are just without water, food, cold, out on the street.... this is our offering and service to them,” said Pema Chagdoetsang of the Utah Tibetan Community.

Chagdoetsang said she knows her prayers won't make things 100 percent better, but she hopes they will help ease some of the suffering.
