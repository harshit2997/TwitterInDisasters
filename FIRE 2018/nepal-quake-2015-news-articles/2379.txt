A DARWIN beautician whose family was killed in the worst earthquake to rock Nepal in more than 80 years will leave the Top End for her hometown in search of surviving loved ones.

Parbati Shrestha Pun, 28, buried her face in her hands as she sobbed from her Casuarina home on Sunday.

She had just learnt 10 of her cousins who lived in a remote village, Sindhupalchok, almost 50km from Kathmandu, had been killed in the disaster.

“My brother called (on Saturday) and he said 90 per cent of the houses (in Sindhupalchok) had collapsed,” she said.

“Nine or 10 people died ... they are all my cousins.

“Four little ones, two older (children) and four (aged between) 25-35.”

Ms Pun spoke to her brother for about two minutes before his phone “went dead”.

She has not been able to contact him since.

“I didn’t get time to ask anything, he was devastated and every time he say something he start to cry,” she said.

Ms Pun’s brother, Shiva Lal Shrestha, 35, was able to speak to her long enough to let her know her mother and father had ­survived.

“My brother saved my parents’ lives,” she said.

“He lives about two minutes from their home and when he felt the earthquake he ran to our parents’ house and took out our mother and father.

“My parents’ house collapsed after that ... it is the home I grew up in (until leaving for Darwin three years ago).”

Ms Pun said her family was now homeless and living in squalor “under the stars” with no access to clean drinking water, food, shelter or medical services.

“Everyone is staying in camps but with no tents,” she said.

Ms Pun will leave Darwin on Monday for Kathmandu where she plans to take a bus to Sin­dhupalchok if conditions ­permit.

“I want to find my family then I will try to help as much as I can,” she said.

Ms Pun’s husband Hem, 40, from Butwal, about 200km west of Kathmandu, will stay in Darwin.

“In my town there is no ­casualty,” he said.

“Everyone is worried about (the aftershocks), there have been many over 5 and 6 on the (Richter) scale.”
