"Even after two weeks, we have not received government assistance," said Rajesh Katuwal, a resident of Sindupalchowk province north of Kathmandu, where 3,000 died of the estimated 7,800 nationwide in the quake on April 25.

Many other villages cut off by the 7.8-magnitude earthquake have reported a similar lack of official help, while some others have reportedly received duplicate aid.

The government said it would dispatch five-member teams to 500affected villages to improve relief allocation.

The United Nations said that its appeal for flash funding for the Nepal crisis had only received 6 per cent of the requested 423million dollars.

Another 93 million dollars had been made available for longer-term funding of development and reconstruction in the country.
