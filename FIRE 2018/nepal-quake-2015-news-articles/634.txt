The Indian government on Sunday issued an advisory requesting media houses to "exercise restraint in speculation about possible after-shocks" in Nepal, as "undue speculation may cause unnecessary panic".

In an official statement, the government said it was making all efforts to provide relief and evacuate stranded citizens from Nepal.

"In view of the coordinated efforts of government of India agencies to evacuate stranded citizens, and to provide relief in the wake of the Nepal earthquake, it is requested that media houses may exercise restraint in speculation about possible after-shocks.

"Undue speculation may cause unnecessary panic complicating relief efforts. The government of India assures that it is making all efforts to provide relief and evacuate stranded citizens in time," the statement said.
