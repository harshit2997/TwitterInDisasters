Wodonga family's return home from Nepal will be difficult

A Wodonga man says his family in Nepal will find it difficult to leave the country after being there for the recent earthquake.

Chris Chamberlain said his wife Sue and adopted Nepalese son Ang Rita Sherpa were on a 16-day Mount Everest base camp trek when the earthquake struck and triggered an avalanche.

Chamberlain told ABC Goulburn Murray that Ang Rita was leading the trek.

The group was due home on May 10th but would likely be home sooner if it could be arranged.

"Obviously with the destruction over there it is probably critical that they try and get out earlier.

"With contact thorough the embassy and people like that over there, if there is any chance of getting out I'm sure that will be taken."

He said his family are currently based at "stable" lodgings in Kathmandu where they have food and water.

Chamberlain said coming back to Wodonga will be difficult for his wife and son.

"They are very well connected to the people over there so they would like to help as much as they can.

"Unfortunately the families which are connected to us, they have lost their homes and their cattle and stuff as well." he said.

He said his son, who also lives in Wodonga with his young family, is shipping items by motorbike to his wife's village.

''Their home has been destroyed but with the assistance of World Expeditions (a trekking organisation), Ang Rita is taking up tents and blankets, and food and water - which is you know lucky."

Chamberlain expected millions of people to be displaced with the disaster.

"The destruction of the town and the cities and the buildings will take a long time to rebuild so they will need all the help they can get.

"Unfortunately I think aid and assistance certainly need to be coordinated so that it is not subject to corruption and things like that that goes on in these poor countries unfortunately."

Chamberlain said his wife first visited Nepal about a decade ago on a trip arranged by Scots School in Albury.

"My daughter Nikki and other students, teachers and my wife Sue went to Nepal initially trekking and that became an annual event."
