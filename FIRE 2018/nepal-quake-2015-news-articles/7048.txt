UK And Nepal In Talks To Bring Back Barred Chinooks
</headline>

<text>
It's understood that the UK government is to hold talks with Nepal over the three RAF Chinooks currently languishing at an Indian Air Force base.

According to Sky News the 'take it or leave it' deal follows the continued denial of entry of the aircraft to the stricken country.

The helicopters, which were dismantled and flown out to the region two weeks ago, are stranded at the Chandigarh Airbase north of Delhi - along with around 40 crew members.

The Nepalese government is said to be worried the downforce from the aircraft's twin-rotors could cause further damage to earthquake-hit buildings when taking off and landing.

The US however is already operating its Osprey heavy lift aircraft in the country.

Chinooks have been widely used in previous rescue and relief missions such as the Pakistan earthquake in 2005.

Many of the Aid organisations in Nepal have called for more helicopters to be brought in but an overwhelmed government in Kathmandu appears to be struggling to manage all the help and equipment being offered.
