Israel Defence Forces have posted a video to their Facebook page showing one of their "disaster dogs" in action.

The video, which is from a camera attached to the dog's harness, was accompanied by the explanation that the dogs were searching for any survivors in the rubble.

In the clip, the dog can be seen running over the rubble into buildings on the hunt for any casualties.

At one point the rescue dog goes upstairs in a residential building and into a room which looks like a child's play den.

The Israel Defence Force disaster relief team first arrived in Nepal on the 27 April, with the aim of rescuing survivors, building a field hospital and locating Israelis.

Rescuers from more than 20 countries have also been searching for survivors, working alongside Nepalese emergency teams.

French, Norwegian and Israeli rescuers took part in a successful operation to extract a woman late Thursday from the ruins of a building in Kathmandu, close to where a teenager had been earlier pulled to safety.

According to the head of the EU delegation, one thousand people from the European Union are currently missing in Nepal and 12 are confirmed dead.
