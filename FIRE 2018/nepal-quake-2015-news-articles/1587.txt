Mackay six on Mt Everest are safe after earthquake
</headline>

SIX Mackay residents, who were on Mt Everest at the time of Saturday's earthquake in Nepal, are safe and well.

Sandy and Frank Marchetti, Gaven and Sherrie Klingner, Jason Horton and Greg Farmilo are at the base camp on the north side of the mountain and have contacted family to let them know they are okay.

Mr and Mrs Marchetti's daughter Allyce said she had spoken with her parents briefly but because they were on Chinese side of the mountain they could not access social media.

She said they didn't know if they could get any further up the mountain so would wait and assess the situation in the next couple of days.

On social media friends were relieved to find out the crew of six were safe.

Just five hours before the earthquake Mr Marchetti had addressed the main Mackay Anzac Day service in Mackay via a phone link.

According to media reports the 7.8 magnitude earthquake hit Nepal at 11.56am local time.

Nepal is four hours and 15 minutes behind Australian Eastern time.

Mr Marchetti's sister, Janelle Tilse, of Mackay, said she hadn't spoken to her brother since the earthquake but had heard from her niece.

"I was talking to their daughter this morning and she said that 'yes they're all okay'," she said.

"They're currently at base camp and are in good spirits.

"I think they'll make a decision in the next couple of days whether they will go on or come back."

Mr Marchetti had planned an attempt to reach the peak of Mt Everest. However, Mrs Tilse said she hoped he would decide to abandon the climb. "If anything at all I think Frank will want to continue on," she said.

Mrs Marchetti was due to fly out on May 6, Mrs Tilse said, but the widespread damage could delay that.

"Apparently the airport tarmac is cracked," she said.
