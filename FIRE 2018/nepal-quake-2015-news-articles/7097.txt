The Singapore Armed Forces (SAF) has concluded its relief efforts in Nepal and returned home Monday afternoon after a 12-day deployment, SAF said in a press release on Monday.

The SAF deployed 38 personnel comprising a medical team as well as staff from the Changi Regional Humanitarian Assistance and Disaster Relief Coordination Center (RHCC), SAF said, adding that another 15 personnel from the Ministry of Health and the Royal Brunei Armed Forces also worked together with the SAF medical team.

Singapore Air Force (RSAF) C-130 aircraft made a total of 11 flights into Nepal and evacuated 71 Singaporeans, along with 24 other nationals from Nepal, it said.

Minister for Defence Ng Eng Hen received the returning personnel at Paya Lebar Air Base. He acknowledged the contributions of the team on the significant role they played in the multinational relief efforts in Nepal.

"I am very happy that Singaporeans have a big heart and when others are in need, they step up. All around, I think this has been a very good mission. We have been able to do what we wanted to do, and of course, we offer our deepest condolences to the people in Nepal," he said.

The combined medical team, which was based in Gokarna, treated some 3,000 patients for injuries sustained in the earthquake. The SAF also donated 150,000 Singapore dollars (112,782 U.S. dollars) worth of humanitarian aid supplies to Nepal which included tents, blankets, portable lights and food. Endi
