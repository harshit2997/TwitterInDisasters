Bay area woman teaching in Nepal, involved in relief efforts

NORTH BEND, Ore. -- A local woman has been teaching in Nepal since last fall and she's putting forth efforts in getting her students involved in relief efforts.



Nora Collins joined the United Mission to Nepal in August, packed her bags and moved to Tansen, a small town in western Nepal.



Nora says when the earthquake struck on April 25th, Tansen was not devastated, but news of other villages greatly affected the community and still does.



"There's a lot of need obviously, and I'm sure you've heard that we had another earthquake today, which is not quite as bad, but there's a lot of destruction from that," said Nora by phone this week.



Eager to help, Nora started a fundraiser and got her students involved.



"Especially the younger ones didn't quite understand what we we're trying to do," she says.



Her students create artwork, which Nora sells on Facebook. The money raised goes to relief efforts. In the meantime, the kids are learning a valuable lesson.



"It just really inspired them and encouraged them that they can make a difference."
