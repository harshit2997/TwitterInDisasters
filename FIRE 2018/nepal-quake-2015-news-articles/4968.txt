Bantwal, May 4: Romel Stephen Moras from Siddakatte in the taluk, who had been caught off-guard when earthquake devastated Nepal, recollects that the earth shook violently for about 22 seconds when he was in Himalayan Height Resort in that country.

"Me and my fellow tourists rushed outside. Luckily, we did not face any peril. I firmly believe that along with God's grace, the blessings and prayers of my parents saved my life. I could come back without any problem thereafter," he told Daijiworld.





Moras reached Bengaluru on Saturday night along with his friend, Anubhav, by flight. His experiences have both sweet and bitter memories. He said that along with him, three others, Anubhav, Mithesh, and Gurudath, had left for Nepal on April 22. The tour however, turned a memorable experience for wrong reasons.

Stephen Moras says he had returned to Kathmandu from the said resort on Sunday last, April 26. He was to leave Kathmandu on Monday morning, but because of inclement weather, the plan went awry. Although Indian government had arranged for free flights, the queue was too long, and people had to wait for days to get seats.

'Therefore, I chose to reach Itarsi from Kathmandu by bus, and then to Siliguri by taxi. I caught a night bus to Kolkata from Siliguri, and then took a flight to Bengaluru from there,' he said.

He is disappointed that the tour programme he had envisaged did not materialize as per his plans. He is moved by death and destruction he witnessed at Nepal.

"The people who have become homeless living in tents has made me sad. I am however happy that I could come back home alive. I have to join for duty on Monday May 4. Therefore, I will come to Bantwal next week, as I am yearning to meet my parents," he explained.

Stephen feels like having survived from ravaged country. He is thankful to the government for showing concern and care for the safety of tourists from Karnataka.
