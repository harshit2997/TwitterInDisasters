An earthquake has shook the Nepal capital Kathmandu and its densely-populated surrounding area, leaving dozens of people injured.

Buildings collapsed and walls toppled after the 7.9-magnitude quake struck at noon local time, according to officials.

Resident Prachanda Sual said several buildings have fallen in the centre of the capital, including centuries-old temples.

He said he saw people running through the streets in panic. Ambulance sirens blared and government helicopters hovered overhead.

National radio warned people to stay outdoors because more aftershocks are feared. It is also asking people to maintain calm.

Old Kathmandu city is a warren of tightly-packed, narrow lanes with poorly-constructed homes piled on top of each other.

Nepal information minister Minendra Rijal told India's NDTV station that there are reports of damage in and around Kathmandu but no immediate word on casualties. He said rescue teams were on the scene.

The epicentre was 49 miles north-west of Kathmandu, Mr Rijal said. The Kathmandu Valley is densely populated with nearly 2.5 million, with the quality of buildings often poor.

An Associated Press reporter in Kathmandu said a wall in his compound collapsed and there was damage to nearby buildings.

The US Geological Survey revised the magnitude from 7.5 to 7.9.

Mohammad Shahab, a resident from Lahore, Pakistan, said he was sitting in his office when the earthquake rocked the city near the border with India.

He said the tremors continued for a while but now the situation was normal. The sustained quake also was felt in India's capital of New Delhi.
