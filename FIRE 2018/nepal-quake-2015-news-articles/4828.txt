PORT Macquarie's Geoff Metcalfe was simply devastated when he heard about the deadly earthquake in Nepal.



The managing director of boutique tour company Dreamtreks has long felt a rapport with the Nepalese people, a sentiment shared by Geoff's daughters Sam, Nikki and Sophie.

"The kids and the people in the villages are the ones I feel for, because there is no medical facilities in a lot of the outer areas and even the ones in Kathmandu are stretched to the limit," he said.

Geoff said he couldn't believe the scenes of devastation.

The earthquake claimed thousands of lives and caused large-scale damage.

Dreamtreks operates treks in Nepal, mainly in the Everest and Annapura regions, with their expert help of guide Ang Tshering Lama, who is safe after the earthquake.

"He is held in high esteem by all my clients," Mr Metcalfe said.

Sam, Nikki and Sophie feel for the people of Nepal and urge Australians not to forget the beautiful country as it struggles to get back on its feet and afterwards.

Sam said it was incomprehensible just how big the earthquake was and even the aftershocks caused more damage.

"It really hits home when you see images of places you've been and where you have stood," she said.

The sisters experienced the people's kindness and have an insight into the hardships ahead given the country does not have the resources or affluence of places like Australia.

Nikki said the clean up process was going to take a long time.

The humanitarian response has swung into action but approaching monsoon season is expected to be a complicating factor.

Sophie encouraged people to support charities with access to what the people need.

The Dreamtreks website at www.dreamtreks.com.au will be updated to include details about how to help after the earthquake drawing on Ang's local knowledge.
