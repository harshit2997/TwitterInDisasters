<text>
CAMBRIDGE, Ontario, April 28, 2015 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Worldline, a division of Fibernetics Corp, is providing free long distance service to Nepal commencing today until May 15th 2015 for Canadians looking to get in touch with friends and family members who have suffered due to the earthquake that devastated that country. It's a simple process. First dial 844 44 NEPAL (63725) and then dial the destination number when prompted.

Dial 844 44 NEPAL (63725)



This will provide a free long distance connection to the Nepal destination number.*



"Our hearts go out to the people of Nepal and all those whose family and friends have been impacted by this disaster," said Worldline Co-Founder and Fibernetics President John Stix.



"With so many people out of contact, we hope just getting in touch with loved ones helps those who have lost so much. We also encourage all Canadians to help however they can."



Saturday's magnitude-7.8 earthquake, centred outside the capital city Kathmandu, was the worst to hit the South Asian nation of 31 million in more than 80 years and has left thousands dead and many thousands more injured. One of deadliest quakes worldwide over the past 40 years, the tragedy is only compounded considering how badly prepared the mountain nation was for such an event. The total economic losses are projected to "exceed the GDP of Nepal."



It also struck at the worst time in the calendar yearâ€”just before the start of monsoon season. According to the United Nations, local hospitals are overloaded and "post-earthquake diseases are a concern," especially as thousands of survivors will now be exposed to the elements. Further, this earthquake is feared to be a lingering disaster, with landslides more common due to the unsettled terrain.



HOW CAN YOU HELP: The Canadian federal government will match -- dollar-for-dollar -- all eligible contributions to the Nepal Earthquake Relief Fund until May 25, and retroactively to when donations first started streaming in on Saturday.



DOCTORS WITHOUT BORDERS

Doctors Without Borders, also known as Medecins Sans Frontieres, said four teams would leave Sunday morning for Nepal from Bihar state in India, where the charity has worked since 2007 and which is close to the Nepal border. The organization is also sending in 3,000 kits including medical supplies. To donate to Doctors Without Borders click here.

*Callers may be subject to any charges from their carrier and regular usage minutes may apply. All we ask is for callers to implement their own "fair use policy" and limit their call time, as we want as many callers to use this free service as possible. Also, as this is a free, it will not be a supported service.
