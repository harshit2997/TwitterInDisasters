SEATTLE -- Just days after a second devastating earthquake in Nepal, a Seattle woman continues her push to help out a family who helped her earlier in life.

Alice Martin was hosted by a family more than a decade ago when she served as a teaching volunteer in Nepal. Now she wants to help them rebuild their home after they lost it in the first earthquake.

"They are giving, caring, supportive, wonderful people," Martin said. "They would give the shirt off their back if they could and they don't have much of anything."

The average income in Nepal is less than $800 U.S. dollars per year. She said it has been devastating to watch a family that had so little to begin with have so much taken away.

"I've seen them so many times actually barely have enough food to feed their families and somehow go ahead and make that meal extend to seven, eight other people who just happened to stop by," Martin said.

Following the first earthquake, Martin launched a YouCaring campaign in an effort to help this family that's given her so much back on their feet.

"I think any way you can help, it's going to good use. This is going to help them rebuild their home," Martin said. "The outpouring of support has been amazing and we started by just sending it to friends and family."

Depending on the amount of money they raise, they may distribute additional funds throughout the village where the family lives.
