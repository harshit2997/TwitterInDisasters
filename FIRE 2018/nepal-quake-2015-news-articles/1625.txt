A strong earthquake aftershock has again hit India. A powerful tremor was felt in northern and eastern parts of the country, and more avalanches were reported near Mount Qomolangma.

Tremors were also felt in the capital, New Delhi, and Patna city in eastern Bihar state, where 35 people lost their lives in Saturday's earthquake.

India media reports so far, 62 people have been killed and over 250 injured since the first quake struck.

The Indian Ministry of External Affairs says nearly 800 Indian nationals have been evacuated from Nepal, with more on the way home. No Indian casualties have yet been reported in Nepal.

"It was like yesterday. Though we will not be able to tell its magnitude, it was very strong. As we read in the newspapers today, that for two to three days, such jolts will be felt, and people need to be warned," said Ajay Sharma, Lucknow resident.



"Yesterday we felt it and knew that it could come again, so we were not that scared. We immediately vacated the house. But still the fear is there," Gopal, a Patna resident, said.
