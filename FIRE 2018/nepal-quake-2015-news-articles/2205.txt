Local Nepali community raising funds for homeland

When Winnipegger Chitra Pradhan’s telephone conversation with his nephew in Nepal went silent on Saturday, he was worried.

Not just because his nephew’s line suddenly cut out over 11,000 kilometres away in Kathmandu, but because of the screaming he heard on the other end.

“As we were talking, the tremors started,” said Pradhan, who has immediate family living in the area that was hit by the 7.8 magnitude earthquake and its violent aftershock on Saturday.

“They screamed, and the phone went dead. I couldn’t contact them for the next 15 hours or so,” said Pradhan. “I was quite frightened.”

While Pradhan said his family managed to escape their crumbling home during the earthquake, thousands of others have since perished in landslides, avalanches, and unstable buildings.

The death toll of the earthquake is at 4,000 — and quickly climbing.

“Going inside the house is almost impossible (for them) now because the walls are cracked, some parts of the roof came down,” said Pradhan, who noted other villages have been completely destroyed by the disaster.

More than 7,000 people have been reported injured.

“They’re now sleeping in the fields and the farmland,” he said.

Here in Winnipeg, the Nepali community is small — about 700 people — but already making a difference.

The Nepal Earthquake Relief Fund Manitoba committee was formed this weekend, according to nepalicsm.com, and has already started planning relief effort for victims of the earthquake.

Meanwhile, the Selinger government announced Monday the province will provide $200,000 for immediate humanitarian assistance in Nepal. The federal government has also announced it will match eligible donations for Nepal relief, dollar for dollar.

Pradhan, a co-chair of the Earthquake Relief Fund Manitoba committee, said people in the community are already coming together to help those devastated by the earthquake.

“Anything we can do to help, we want to do.”

People interested in helping can drop off donations at TD Canada Trust locations in Winnipeg.
