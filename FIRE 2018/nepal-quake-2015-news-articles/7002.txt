US military risks its own helping out in disasters across the world

The US military takes plenty of heat from it critics. But when disaster strikes around the globe, who do they call?

Yep: America and its military. And they always deliver — though sometimes at great risk, as events in Nepal this week show.

It’s not just combat that puts our troops in harm’s way. A Marine helicopter on a relief mission went missing.

Officials held out hope Wednesday that the chopper had landed safely. With no signs of a crash, the missing — six Marines and two Nepalese soldiers — may just be cut off in the mountains, unable to get a radio signal out. Yet radio chatter about a fuel problem before the chopper vanished raises serious fears.

To provide humanitarian support after the April 25 quake, some 300 US military personnel have gone to Nepal, working with the US Agency for International Development.

American forces deploy to help out in catastrophes all the time — most recently in Pakistan, the Philippines, Haiti and Thailand, as well as in the fight against Ebola in West Africa. In all, the United States launches as many as 70 missions a year to as many as 50 nations.

More than any other nation, this country has the assets, the know-how — and the compassion — to help out. “We’re great at transportation and logistics,” Pentagon official Lt. Col. Jeffrey Pool told The Post.

He said teams do everything from fixing airfields to purifying water to delivering food, water and other supplies. USAID teams assisted in two high-profile rescues in Nepal.

We’ll keep our fingers crossed for the six Marines and two Nepalese soldiers, pending more info.

Meanwhile, let’s offer a full salute to the USAID teams and our military personnel — even those not in combat.
