BANGKOK, 26 April 2015 – The government has launched a donation campaign to mobilize assistance for Nepal; meanwhile, the military and the Ministry of Public Health are prepared to send doctors and disaster response teams to the quake-hit country.

According to deputy spokesperson of the PM Office Col Sansern Kaewkamnerd, the Thai humanitarian teams will be flying to the country closest to Nepal before proceeding into affected areas, as Nepal’s international airport has been temporarily closed as a result of the tremor. The Thai Embassy in Nepal will facilitate the trip.

Col. Sansern said Thai people could help alleviate the hardships of the Nepalese by donating necessary items for survival or money via all the Damrongdhama centers, under the Ministry of Interior, across the country. The government will also hold a charity program for Nepal, which will be broadcast live on Channel 5 next week.

Thai people living in Nepal and nearby countries affected by the massive quake can contact the Thai Embassy in Nepal for help.
