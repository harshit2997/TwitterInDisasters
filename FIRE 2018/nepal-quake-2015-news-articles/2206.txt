NEW DELHI: Defence Minister Manohar Parrikar on Sunday said the aim of the government, which is mounting mammoth rescue efforts dubbed “Operation Maitri” in quake-ravaged Nepal, was to be the first to respond to any crisis in the neighbourhood.

“India is a large country in the neighbourhood and we have responded in a quick span of time to a neighbouring country’s need, be it Nepal or the Maldives,” he said.

Parrikar further said that “the difference this time is that there is a new government here and rescue efforts were initiated very swiftly”.

While over 500 Indians have been evacuated so far from Nepal, another 1,500 will be brought back on Sunday via civil and Indian Air Force aircraft, the minister said.

Interacting with journalists at the Rashtrapati Bhavan on the sidelines of a Defence Investiture Ceremony, the minister underlined that the first few hours are the most important in rescue operations.

Asked if strategic reasons had seen India rushing aid to Nepal in such a big way, he said, “It is more than strategic. India shares long cultural and family ties with Nepal. We are obligated to help the country in their hour of need.”

The minister said neighbouring countries had again started feeling comfortable with India.

“It is important for the neighbours to get comfortable with us and it is happening again now. When the Maldives faced a water crisis, we moved swiftly. When the runway in Kathmandu got blocked due to an accident, we responded quickly to help them.

Army officials said that a multi-national coordination Centre had been set up. In addition, in Pokhara, headquarters are being established for relief operations.

According to Army spokesperson Colonel Rohan Anand, 18 medical teams have been earmarked for relief operation, six of which have already been deployed and the rest are on standby.
