Please join the NTCC SGA in their efforts to support Dolls for Nepal!

Dolls for Nepal is an organization dedicated to relieving the stress caused by a 7.8 magnitude earthquake that struck Nepal on April 25th, 2015. Operations are underway to rescues those trapped as well as providing medical assistance to those who are in urgent need. Dolls for Nepal will act in the next phase of the response by providing clean water, food, clothing, and shelter to Nepalese in need. We have volunteers on the ground assessing the situation that will report what supplies and help are in need. We are concentrating on the area surrounding Bhaktapur, an ancient city that received massive damage from the earthquake. As a token of hope we will present Nepali children with handcrafted dolls that have been donated.

Joe and Jessica Whinery of Pittsburg, Texas, created Dolls for Nepal as a way to help a suffering community. While attending Texas A&M University-Commerce the couple made friends with many Nepali and Joe traveled to Nepal his senior year to study Nepali agriculture. Jessica is a teacher and understands the importance of comforting children in their time of need and is dedicated to helping comfort Nepali children. Joe is a veteran of the Army and knows that traumatic events can cause lasting hardship, he is giving back as a way to heal and be healed.

Dolls for Nepal has happily partnered with the Northeast Texas Community College Student Government Association who will spread the word and help raise funds for the relief effort. Students have also been encouraged to help craft dolls.

By visiting our website, DollsforNepal.org you can help the children of Nepal cope with this natural disaster. All donations will be used to help those in need.
