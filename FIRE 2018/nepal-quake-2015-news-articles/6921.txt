Calgary restaurant hosting Nepal fundraiser
</headline>

A Calgary chef who experienced the destruction of the earthquake in Nepal is helping organize a fundraiser to support relief efforts.

Cam Dobranski and his new wife Jacq were hiking in the Lang Tang region when the quake hit. They had to walk out part of the way before getting on the first airlift in a Canadian military plane.

“It was pretty scare for us,” he said. “But at least we got out alive and made it back to Canada. A lot of people lost everything and have to stay there and put their lives back together.”

One hundred per cent of proceeds from a fundraiser at Container Bar in Kensington Thursday, May 14, will go to the charity ‘Uphill Both Ways,’ to help rebuild schools in Nepal.

The event runs from Noon to 11 p.m. and will include several silent auction items and a raffle for a grand prize $6000 travel gift card.
