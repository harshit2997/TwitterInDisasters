The Chinese military has sent a 70-member team to Nepal to begin disease prevention work in quake-hit areas, a Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson said on Monday.

The team arrived in Nepal on Sunday at the Himalayan country's request, spokesperson Hua Chunying said, adding that the team brought professional equipment and medical supplies for disinfection and epidemic control.

At Nepal's request, Chinese Armed Police Force troops also arrived in the country on Sunday from Zham Town, which lies near the Nepal-China border, to help repair the highway connecting China and Nepal, Hua said.

The spokesperson said the first shipment of 186 tonnes of emergency aid from the Chinese government arrived in Nepal on Saturday.

According to Hua, an aid team of 20 members sent by the Red Cross Society of China arrived in Nepal on Saturday, and the organization also provided 2,000 tents.
