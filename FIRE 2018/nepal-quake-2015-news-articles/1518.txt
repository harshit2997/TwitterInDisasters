28 Mexicans have been confirmed safe in Nepal after the strong quake, Mexico's Foreign Ministry (SRE) said in a statement on Sunday, adding that one Mexican citizen has not been located so far.

The statement said from the total of 29 Mexican citizens in Nepal, 24 are visitors and have already been contacted.

The Mexican embassy in India has confirmed safe conditions of other four Mexicans who live in Nepal.

The family of 26-year-old Mexican citizen Eduardo Chenandoa Ramirez Santiso, who was in Nepal at the moment of earthquake, has not been able to contact him so far, local media reported Sunday.

Ramirez sent a Facebook message to his parents before the earthquake, asking them to send him money because he had run out of it.

The family of Ramirez, who live in Victoria city in Mexico's northeastern state of Tamaulipas, said he was last located in Nepal in Dhampus region, but so far they have not been able to contact him again.

Claudia Zapata, cousin of the missing Mexican citizen, said Chenandoa travelled to Nepal to learn more about Buddhist culture.

Zapata said so far Mexican authorities had not informed them anything about his cousin.

"We are investigating the whereabouts of Mexican people based on requests and family information," said SRE.

In the framework of the Pacific Alliance consular cooperation agreement, the Mexican embassy holds coordinated actions with the embassies of Colombia, Chile and Peru.

The goal is to assist the citizens of any of these four countries who are currently in Nepal and if necessary help them travel to India.

The strong earthquake hit Nepal on Saturday and has killed more than 3,200 people, according to official figures. Endi
