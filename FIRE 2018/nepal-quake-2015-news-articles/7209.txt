Swim teams to hold Nepal fundraiser
</headline>

<text>
The Water Rats swim team and the Staples High girls and boys swim teams will gather at the Westport Weston Family YMCA on Wednesday, May 27, for Swim for Nepal, a five-hour event to raise money for Save the Children’ s Nepal relief efforts.

Less than three weeks after a 7.8 magnitude earthquake struck the country on April 25, Nepal was hit again on May 12 by an earthquake of 7.3.

This last quake caused more damage and compounded relief efforts. The monsoon season is only a few weeks away and people in Nepal urgently need shelter, clean water and health care.

High school and middle school swimmers will swim as much as they can in one hour. Many will swim at least three miles in an hour (212 lengths of the pool). Swimmers age eight and younger will swim as much as they can in 30 minutes.

Swim for Nepal was created by Aileen Coyne, Scott Adler and Mark Schachter, all of whom swim for Staples and the Water Rats.

Donations can be made by check payable to Save the Children with Westport Swim in the memo line or online at www.crowdrise.com/swimfornepal.

The Water Rats Parents Club’s last two fundraisers for Save the Children — Swim for Haiti and Swim for the Philippines — raised more than $40,000 each.
