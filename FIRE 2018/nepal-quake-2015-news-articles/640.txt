The Changi RHCC will assist the Nepalese national disaster management authorities and military with their efforts to coordinate the relief efforts. Also on board the C-130 aircraft are a search and rescue team from the Singapore Civil Defence Force and a contingent from the Singapore Police Force.



Standing ready to be deployed is the SAF medical team of about 16 medical personnel, who will provide medical aid to victims of the earthquake.
