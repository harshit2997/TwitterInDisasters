The family of Tamara McLeod, a Calgary based artist and world traveller, fear for her safety following recent earthquakes, aftershocks and avalanches in Nepal.

In her most recent email, sent to her grandmother on April 14, Tamara said she was trekking in the mountainous region of Langtang.

“A friend of mine from Tasmania, met her in Kathmandu, so well be trekking together. I’m very excited to be out in the fresh air,” recites Michelle Dack from her younger sister’s email to her grandmother.

Tamara’s last known location was near the suspected epicenter of the deadly quake and her family has not heard from her since disaster struck Nepal.

The 24-year-old was not expected to resume contact with her family in Canada until Monday, but the 7.8 magnitude earthquake, which claimed the lives of more than 2,400 people, has Tamara’s family concerned.

“After looking on Twitter, we're finding out that other Canadians are stuck in this Langtang region,” explains Michelle. “They're completely isolated. There's no road to get to them and they don't have food or supplies there.”

On Saturday, Tamara’s father attempted to call her cellphone. The phone was answered, the voice of a man was heard, but the call ended when the line went dead.

Michelle says her father was heartbroken following the call and the family’s subsequent unsuccessful attempts to reach Tamara or the Canadian Consulate in Katmandhu.

“I know he's devastated,” said Michelle. “Tamara is way too beautiful and too young to be...We just need her to be okay.”

Tamara’s courage and love of adventure are admired by her older sibling.

“She is the most incredible woman I’ve ever met,” beams Tamara. “She does things that many of us dream to be able to do because she’s just so determined to really live life everyday as if it’s the last.”

“She’s had adventures that we can all be in awe of.”
