In response to the recent devastating earthquake that struck Nepal, the Nepalese Student Association UCF plans to host a candlelight vigil on Wednesday for the victims and survivors.

The vigil will take place at the Reflecting Pond, starting at 7 p.m.

The Facebook event page asks attendees to bring candles, lighters or cups to hold the candle.

At Monday's meeting, the members of the association spoke about possible efforts they can do to help those suffering.

"After the discussion, we decided to create an account on GoFundMe to collect donations, on the NSA UCF account and then donate the amount in a periodic basis to victims through some reliable sources [such as] Red Cross and UNICEF," president of NSA Takat Rawal said.

Members plan to keep donation boxes in the SGA and OSI offices, as well as other places that have yet to be decided.

"We are in the process [of] gathering support in the form of money, or food, clothes and medical supplies," Rawal said. "Once we are able to collect, we will donate as an aggregate to the reliable organization, which is helping directly to the victims in the earthquake-affected area."

Saturday's powerful earthquake shook Nepal leaving an aftermath of more than 5,000 deaths confirmed, with the death toll expected to rise. On Mount Everest, where the earthquake launched an avalanche, at least 18 were killed and more were injured, as reported by USA Today. The nation's capital, Katmandu, was hit as well and at least 61 were found dead outside of Nepal in areas of India, Bangladesh, China's region of Tibet and Pakistan.
