</headline>

Rescue efforts are still going on after another earthquake, this one a magnitude 7.3, hit Nepal. A few weeks ago more than 8000 people were killed by a magnitude 7.8 earthquake. Doctor Mohammad Afzal Arain from Madera wants to help the earthquake victims and is getting ready to go to Nepal.

"It's gift to God for me, so I want to share and help the people," says Dr. Arain.

The surgeon is part of a group of five doctors who will travel to Nepal. Not only will he perform operations, he will also take donations and supplies to victims of both earthquakes.

"When I watched the disaster happening in Nepal, and every day the numbers is increasing from 1000 to 2000 to 8000," adds Dr. Arain, "I feel very sorry for the people."

The doctor is paying for all his expenses. Donations that he has helped raise will go entirely to people in Nepal.

"You are able to help other people and you get inner satisfaction in life, because you aren't going to live forever," says Dr. Arain, "Whatever good you do, you lay down at night and think about it, once you're done, it gives you piece of mind."

This isn't the first time Dr. Arain has helped people overseas. He's been to Haiti, Indonesia, and several countries affected by natural disasters.

"I went over the hospital and this guy held my hand and said, 'Thank you for saving my life and helping and as long as I live, I'll pray for you,' and I almost cried," says Dr. Arain.

The doctor will in Nepal for 9-days.
