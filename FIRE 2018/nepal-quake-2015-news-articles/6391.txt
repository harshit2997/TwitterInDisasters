THE recent earthquake horror in Nepal has spurred a school on to don its fundraising hat and raise money for those who have lost homes and livelihoods.

Pupils from Dormer House School, in Moreton, held a fete with stalls, a marble jar, splat the rat, knock over the can, throw the fish, hook the fish, touchy feely things, suck the skittles, apple bobbing, and stick the tail on the unicorn.

Youngsters also sold friendship bracelets in the colours of the Nepalese flag and at the end of the day raised £650 and included £7 from Year 1 pupil Amelia Balhatchet which represented 14 weeks' pocketmoney.

This money will go towards buying tents, water, medical supplies and blankets.

Dormer’s headteacher, AlisonThomas, said: “I am incredibly proud of the children for taking it upon themselves to raise much needed funds for the people of Nepal. They organised some wonderful activities and raised a fantastic amount of money."
