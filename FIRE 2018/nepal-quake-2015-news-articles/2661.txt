Candles have been lit outside the city hall in Belfast as a mark of respect to those who lost their lives in Nepal.

More than 5,000 people are now known to have died in Saturday's earthquake.

The UN estimates eight million people have been affected by the disaster - more than a quarter of the population.

Around 100 members of the Nepalese community in Northern Ireland gathered in a show of support for those affected by the disaster.

Among those attending was Laxman Chimariya.

His family have been left homeless as a result of the earthquake.

"We lost my house, my parents house, it collapsed," he said.

"They are staying outside under the open sky, there is no water or electricity in our place and no proper tent and the weather is not good there, it rained all night. We cannot communicate with them."
