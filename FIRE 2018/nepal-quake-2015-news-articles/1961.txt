8:00am UPDATE: An Iowa man reported missing after a massive earthquake triggered an avalanche on Mt. Everest in Nepal has reached out via Facebook to say he's OK.

In his post, Cole Donahue said: "Greetings from Nepal! A big thank you to all of my family and friends that have expressed their concerns. I was about 45 minutes away from Everest Base Cmap when the earthquake which then caused a gigantic avalance occurred. It buried myself and 6 others I was with but we were all out within seconds and all walked away with no injuries. I would have been in contact sooner however, all communications have been down in the mountains, so I have spent the last 2 days hiking to the nearest civilized town to reach out. I will be stateside by the 2nd."

Donahue is from New Albin, in Allamakee County in northeast Iowa.

NEW ALBIN, IA (CBS2/FOX28) - A man originally from New Albin is missing after the earthquake that hit Nepal and triggered an avalanche on Mount Everest.

It was an once-in-a-lifetime trip for Cole Donahue. He had just turned 30 and within the last year, moved to Tulsa, Oklahoma for a job with an aviation company, according to his sister-in-law, Anna Donahue.

Over the phone, she told CBS 2/FOX 28, Cole "spontanously" decided to go to Nepal and climb Mount Everest for "an adventure," after his birthday and new job.

Donahue said they filed a missing persons report Saturday morning with the U.S. Embassy in Kathmandu. She said they haven't heard back from anyone since then, "If we can get a connection line, get a picture over there, if anybody can do that, or put a picture on backpacks and go around showing Cole, anything will help," she said.

The family said they are trying to pinpoint where Cole would have been when the earthquake shook Nepal and the surrounding countries. She said they're guessing he was somewhere between Kathmandu and the Mount Everest Base Camp, from posts on Facebook. Donahue said Cole told a college friend he wouldn't have phone service for awhile sometime this past week.

Donahue said they are just hoping he's alive and want to get the word out so they can find Cole.

"It's really an insane waiting game. You just kinda get on this conclusion that you just want to physically go over there. It's scary. You have a loved one over there, it's the worst thing," she said. Anna said if they don't hear back soon, she and her husband, Cole's brother, will go over to Nepal and look for Cole.

A family member has set up a GoFundMe page to raise money to fly to Nepal to try and search for Cole. They are also asking people to contact them through Facebook: 'Cole Donahue-Missing'.
