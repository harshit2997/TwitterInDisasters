Governments, groups rush to help quake-devastated Nepal

NEW DELHI/LONDON – Governments, private companies and humanitarian groups rushed to provide aid to Nepal after the country was slammed by its worst earthquake in more than eight decades.

More than 1,800 are confirmed dead so far in yesterday’s (April 25) 7.8-magnitude quake. The toll is expected to rise in coming days as teams dig through the ruins of collapsed buildings. Critical infrastructure, from mobile phone towers to water purification, was interrupted or destroyed.

Major aid groups including Oxfam, Save the Children and Unicef quickly refreshed their websites with emergency appeals for donations. Images of destruction circulated on social media, including under the Twitter hashtag NepalEarthquake, showing massive piles of rubble and tents springing up in the country’s historic capital city, whose origins date back almost 2,000 years. A key development has been the reopening of Kathmandu’s airport.

“We know the damage is extensive and that access into rural areas will be very, very difficult for everybody,” said Mr Ben Pickering, Save the Children’s humanitarian adviser in Britain. “Children will be affected in many ways. Physical injuries. Separated from families.”

An initial pledge of US$1 million (S$1.33 million) in humanitarian assistance from the US government was equalled by technology giant Google, which had one executive killed in a landslide on Mount Everest and was scrambling to bring home three other employees. The US Agency for International Development is deploying a disaster assistance response team and urban search and rescue efforts, Secretary of State John Kerry said in a statement.

INDIA LEADS

Much of the first response, though, fell to neighbouring India. Prime Minister Narendra Modi pledged aid and sought to provide relief for citizens in northern India who also were affected by the temblor.

“We are in the process of finding out more information and are working to reach out to those affected, both at home and in Nepal,” Mr Modi tweeted soon after the quake.

Some 34 people died in India, including 23 in Bihar, Home Secretary L C Goyal told reporters in New Delhi.

The earthquake caused major damage in densely populated parts of the Himalayan nation and shook buildings in India, Tibet and Bangladesh.
