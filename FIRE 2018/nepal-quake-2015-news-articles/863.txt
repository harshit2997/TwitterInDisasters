Members of Calgary’s Nepalese community spent a significant portion of their Saturday attempting to phone their loved ones in Nepal following a tragic earthquake in the Asian nation.

“I tried to contact my family members but it's very, very hard to get connected,” said Calgarian Prasanna Shrestha.

The magnitude 7.8 earthquake in the Katmandu Valley struck at approximately noon and resulted in hundreds of deaths. When night fell, residents were asked to remain outdoors to ensure they would remain safe in the event of aftershocks.

Rishi Bastkoti says the people of Nepal were not prepared to face disaster.

“The hospitals are not well equipped,” explains Bastkoti. “They are not prepared for this type of devastating disaster. So treatments are being undertaken in the streets.”

Prime Minister Stephen Harper offered his condolences and Canada will send its disaster assistance response team to Nepal. Shrestha says the Canadian contingent will bring much needed relief to the region.

The Nepalese community in Calgary is connecting with their brethren across Canada in an attempt to unify earthquake recovery fundraising efforts.

In Nepal, the primary concern is locating those trapped in debris and housing the displaced.

“There are so many orphans, so many people killed, so many people on the streets, without homes, so many homeless,’ said Bastkoti.

Canadians wanting to contribute to the people of Nepal may donate to organizations including the Red Cross, World Vision or NRNA-Canada Earthquake Help.
