Thousands Killed in Nepal Earthquake
</headline>

<text>
The nation of Nepal is asking for the worlds assistance after a 7.9-magnitude earthquake killed over 4,000 people.

It’s being called the worst earthquake to strike the region in more than 80 years. Nine out of ten of the country’s soldiers are working on rescue efforts. The death toll of 4,000 people is expected to continue to rise as rescuers make their way to smaller, cut off villages.

China, India, the United Kingdom, and the U.S. have all sent emergency aid to the region. Nepal says it’s still in need of blankets, helicopters, and doctors. On Monday morning, Secretary of State John Kerry announced the U.S. would be sending more aid to the county over the coming days.

Around 200 climbers of Mount Everest have also been stranded by avalanches caused by the earthquakes. Survivors near the Mountain are having to be taken out by helicopter due to the dangerous situation of after shocks.

Dozens of people have also reportedly been killed by the earthquake in neighboring China and India.
