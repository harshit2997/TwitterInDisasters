Martin Gattuso, 38, originally from Sporle, near Swaffham, was one of at least 30 British nationals listed as missing following the devastating earthquake which has killed more than 5,000 people.

His parents Mike and Sue Gattuso, who still live in Sporle, had still not made contact with their son and were awaiting news of his whereabouts and confirmation that he is safe last night.

Mr Gattuso, 69, a retired teacher who worked at Litcham High School, said: “The best we’ve got is news that he had a meeting with someone in Kathmandu on April 20 and he was heading to the Chinese border, away from the epicentre.”

He added; “We are very worried but hopeful that he will be okay.”
