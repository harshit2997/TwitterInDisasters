A Winnipeg couple is relieved their daughter is now out of Nepal and on her way to San Francisco.

Ted and Jackie Glowacki's daughter Barbara Lovett was working as a nurse practitioner in the tiny, remote village of Lapa when the earthquake hit April 25. Lapa is near the epicentre of the quake.

Ted Glowacki spoke with his daughter shortly after.

"She says it's going to take a long time to get over it. She said when the earthquake hit she was just walking into the house. She felt the tremors. She ran out. The house collapsed. She ran to some hill and she and around 80 or 90 people all stood on that little hill holding on and the hill just kept shaking for hours."

Glowacki says his daughter lived in a tent for 4 days without sleeping, tending to the injured.

"She ran out of sutures and was using crazy glue to administer to people. She was using boards for splints for broken limbs."

The Glowacki family was anxious for their daughter to get out.

Her employer, Himalayan Health, arranged for a helicopter to come into the village. Glowacki says his daughter then travelled by truck for a couple of hours to Kathmandu and is now on a flight to San Francisco.

"This is terrific! What a relief! We are waiting to have a really good conversation with her because she was really, really tired when we talked to her," said Glowacki.

Glowacki says his daughter is grateful no one in the village was killed.

Jackie and Ted say Barbara had been in Nepal since February 27th to work on getting clean water to communities.

They want to thank the media and Himalayan Healthcare for their efforts in covering the catastrophe and the safe evacuation of their daughter.
