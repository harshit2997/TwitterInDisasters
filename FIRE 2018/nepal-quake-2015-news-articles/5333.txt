Nepal earthquake: Fundraiser for victims to be held in Windsor tonight
</headline>

<text>
Windsorites with roots in Nepal are doing what they can to help earthquake victims in their home country.

There will be a fundraising spaghetti dinner Friday night at 6 p.m. at the Optimist Community Centre on Ypres Avenue.

Tickets cost $15 and are available at the door. All donations and proceeds will go to Nepal through the Red Cross.

Bhanu Dhungana is one of the organizers.

"Right now, there has been a lot of destruction and there's a huge loss in society, in the entire nation. There is a lot of problems going on, so the small amount we can send from here, collectively. That can be a very useful amount for the development," Dhungana said.

Dhungana said his family in Nepal is fine, but they are still dealing with the aftermath.

"Still they are getting some aftershocks ... less-than-five-magnitude quakes. Every day there is five six, even 10 eleven aftershocks every day," he said. "They're quite used to it."

A gathering at the South Asian Centre Thursday night began with a moment of silence for the victims of the recent earthquake in Nepal.

Members of the South Asian Centre will join the Nepalese community Friday at Optimist Park for the pasta dinner to raise funds for earthquake victims.

"They need all kinds of support; money, medicine, clothes, food," said Jeewan Gill, the Secretary of the South Asian Centre.
