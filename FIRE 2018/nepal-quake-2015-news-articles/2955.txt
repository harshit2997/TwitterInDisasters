A couple of Maritimers are joining the relief effort in Nepal after Saturday’s devastating earthquake.

They include Neil Bauman, an architect from Saint John.

Communications director for the Atlantic Region of the Canadian Red Cross Dan Bedell told News 95.7 Bauman is an experienced relief worker.

“His expertise with the Red Cross is in shelter issues, so immediately sheltering people and then starting to look at the longer term shelter and recovery needs for people,” said Bedell.

Bauman recently returned from Vanuatu, where he was working with those affected by Tropical Storm Pam. and has helping out in other relief efforts in other areas including Haiti, Thailand and the Philippines.

Also headed to Nepal is Janice Babineau, a communications specialist from Halifax, who will be working on the Red Cross social media team.

“Social media has become the best way to reach people directly and answer their questions,” he said.

Canadians wishing to support the disaster response can contribute financially online at redcross.ca/Nepal or by calling 1-800-418-1111.

You can also donate by texting REDCROSS to 45678 for a $10 donation or 30333 to donate $5.
