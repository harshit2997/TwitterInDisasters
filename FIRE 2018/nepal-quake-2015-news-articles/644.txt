As many as 35 people from Belagavi district, who were on a company-sponsored tour to Nepal, are said to be safe.

The police headquarters and various police stations were trying to trace the members of the group, as their family members started inquiring about their safety after a massive earthquake rocked parts of Nepal on Saturday.

Chikkodi Deputy Superintendent of Police S.R. Patil and Police Sub-inspector Sangamesh Bidiginal told The Hindu that the group of 35 people, all dealers or retailers of agro-products, had gone on a tour to Nepal.

The group included five persons from Chikkodi, one of whom called the police and confirmed that the group was safe and were nowhere near the areas affected by the earthquake, as they were returning and on the way to Varanasi in Uttar Pradesh.
