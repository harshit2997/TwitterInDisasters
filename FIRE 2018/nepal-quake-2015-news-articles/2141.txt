Thousands are dead after the worst earthquake the country has seen in 80 years, now Nepalese students in Nebraska are coming together after tragedy strikes home.

Members of the Nepalese Students Association met at the UNL east campus union Saturday to offer each other support and comfort in a time of great loss.

One student says his family lives just six miles away from downton Kathmandu. Now, they are left homeless, still feeling the aftershocks of the massive quake.

"They are telling me like they don't have like enough water and the food, and they are living outside and there are still couple of earthquake from time to time, small earthquake so they are still scared about that. What will happen next?" said grad student Nabarha Banjara.

More than 2,200 people have been killed in the earthquake and repeated aftershocks. With Nepal's government overwhelmed by the scale of the disaster, India flew in medical supplies and relief crews Sunday. China also sent in an emergency team.
