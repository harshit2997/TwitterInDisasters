KATHMANDU, May 8 -- The China International Search and Rescue team left Nepal on Friday after completing a quake rescue and relief operation.

"The team arrived in Nepal in the following day of earthquake and was one of the first heavy Urban Search and Rescue (USAR) rescue team in Nepal," said Captain Prabal, liaison officer for the Chinese rescue team based at Narayanhiti Palace museum.

During its 12-day of stay in Nepal, the 67-member team cleared its assigned areas - Dhading Besi of Dhading and Balaju of Kathmandu district. They extricated two people trapped in the debris.

Major Sujit Silwal from the Nepal army, who was working closely with all foreign rescue teams in Nepal, was impressed by the rescue capacity and equipment of the Chinese rescue team.

"They have very good working ethics and we are really thankful to them for their hard work," he said.

Medical staff of the team treated more than 3,700 quake victims and checked 7,481 others from different areas of Kathmandu after the April 25 earthquake.

Qu Guosheng, deputy leader of the Chinese team, said they could support the Nepalese government in disaster management.

The Chinese team also handed over logistic and medical equipment to the Kathmandu valley department of the Nepal army.
