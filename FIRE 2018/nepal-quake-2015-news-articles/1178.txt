The Swedish Civil Contingencies Agency is sending 60 search and rescue personnel and dogs on Monday to Nepal with enough supplies for an operation to last for more than two weeks, news agency TT reports. The Swedish International Development Agency is also funneling SEK 13 million to the group to help with its relief efforts.

The government has also pledge to help through the United Nations and expressed its sympathy with the Nepali people.

"The earthquake has caused great devastation and many people are still missing. Large-scale rescue operations and measures to assist the victims can be expected," Foreign Minister Margot Wallström and Isabella Lövin, international development minister, wrote in a joint statement. "Sweden will contribute through its core support to UN humanitarian bodies and is ready to respond to calls for additional assistance."

The natural disaster was Nepal's worst earthquake in 81 years with a magnitude of 7.9 on the Richter scale.

Around 150 Swedes are known to be in Nepal, with no reports of casualties. Most have been accounted for, reports AFP.

Swedish media has also been in touch with various Swedes who live or were traveling through the area. Newspaper Aftonbladet spoke with Jenny Adhikari, who lives in Nepal. She told the newspaper that she was riding a bus in the town of Melamchi, just northeast of the capital Kathmandu, when the ground began to shake.

"A huge stone crashed only about 20 meters from the bus," she said. "All the houses around me have tumbled down. I think there are lot of people who have died."
