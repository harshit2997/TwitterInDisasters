SINGAPORE - The Singapore contingent in Nepal will return home in the coming days as their mission ends, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MFA) said on Friday.

After the 7.8-magnitude earthquake on April 25, Singapore sent a total of 182 officers in response to Nepal's call for international assistance, MFA said in a statement.

They will be returning as the Nepalese authorities have announced the end of search and rescue operations.

The Singapore Police Force and Singapore Civil Defence Force, Singapore Armed Forces, Ministry of Health and the Health Sciences Authority all deployed personnel to Nepal.

MFA also despatched a crisis response team to Kathmandu, which provided consular assistance to Singaporeans stranded in Nepal among other duties.

The Republic of Singapore Air Force (RSAF) operated a total of eight flights between Singapore and Nepal with its C-130 aircraft to transport personnel, equipment and relief supplies.

The RSAF evacuated a total of 95 Singaporeans, permanent residents and foreign nationals from Nepal.

The C-130s also helped airlift medical personnel from the Royal Brunei Armed Forces and a French member of the UN Disaster Assessment and Coordination Team into Nepal.

Medical personnel attended to more than 2,500 injured or sick Nepalese people. Medical supplies have been given to the Singapore Red Cross currently in Nepal to provide medical relief to the local population.

Humanitarian aid supplies have also been transferred to Nepalese networks, and a team from Singapore helped with the Nepalese authorities' coordination of relief efforts.

The Singapore Government contributed $250,000 through the Singapore Red Cross to help the Nepalese people.

MFA said: "Singapore hopes that our assistance will make a tangible difference to the lives of Nepalese survivors during this very difficult period."
