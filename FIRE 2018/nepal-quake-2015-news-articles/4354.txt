SA couple rescued after being trapped in Nepal

Mike Sherman confirmed that he and Kate Ahrends have both been rescued and are safe.

KATHMANDU - Eyewitness News has made contact with a South African man stranded in a remote area in Nepal when a helicopter arrived ready to rescue him and a travel partner.

Two more South Africans are believed to be with them.

EWN phoned the Dhunche Army Camp and managed to speak to a man who identified himself as Mike Sherman who has been trapped in Langtang since the quake.

He also confirmed that he's with another missing South African, Kate Ahrends.

But when asked whether they're with the other two missing South Africans, he seemed not to be aware of them.

Sherman said they're safe.

The call ended shortly after he told EWN a chopper just arrived and the phone line went dead.

Meanwhile, rainy weather is hampering relief efforts in quake-stricken Nepal, with aid group Gift of the Givers' operation now temporarily suspended in the capital Kathmandu.

More than 5,000 people have been confirmed dead after Saturday's 7.8 magnitude earthquake.

The South African team has not been able to go out to villages and start with the day's search and rescue operation as rainy weather is making it difficult for teams to operate.

Local security personnel have also slowed down their work with government allegedly interfering in relief operations.

Locals have also told EWN the government is only sending aid to a specific location in central Kathmandu while villages on the outskirts have been left in the lurch.

They say officials are failing to provide aid to orphans and those sleeping in the open after their houses collapsed.
