Following the massive earthquake Saturday that took thousands of lives in Nepal, relief and resources from across the world — including Ithaca — are pouring in to help.

An Ithaca- and Kathmandu-based charity, Educate the Children, has set up a relief fund to support earthquake victims.

The death toll has risen above 3,700, with thousands more injured, according to the Associated Press.

The fund will support relief and rebuilding efforts in Nepal, where Educate the Children has a 25-year history. The organization said the aid will go to areas reporting serious damage and loss of life. ETC workers are currently in Dolakha, but aid will also go to the Kathmandu Valley and in Rasuwa/Nuwakot districts, where they have worked in the past, they said.

On Saturday, Cornell University president David Skorton issued a statement to the community regarding the quake, citing the university's many "personal and professional ties to the region"

Skorton said the university has ties to Nepal through faculty, students, staff, alumni, parents and friends. He said they have reached out to all of their students in Nepal and know they are safe. They have also started establishing ways to provide them with support, he said.

"We hope that the region quickly will begin to recover. I encourage all Cornellians to consider ways we can participate in relief efforts through donations and other kinds of humanitarian aid or through specific expertise," Skorton said in the release.
