SPRING LAKE, MI (WTVB) - Help for those affected by the massive earthquake in the Himalayans is pouring in from around the globe and across West Michigan.

International Aid is seeking help from the community to provide relief supplies to the people of Nepal. Nearly 1.4 million people need food in Nepal following last weekend's 7.8 magnitude earthquake. Tim Lopez, Communication and Marketing Manager of International Aid in Spring Lake says they are working with other organizations to determine the needs so that they may best respond.

Lopez says cash is the best way to respond right now.

To donate call their donation line at 1-800-251-2502 or head to their website www.internationalaid.org
