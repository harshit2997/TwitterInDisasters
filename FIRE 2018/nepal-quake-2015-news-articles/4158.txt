Teen Rescued 5 Days After Deadly Nepal Earthquake - WBNS-10TV Columbus, Ohio | Columbus News, Weather & Sports

An 18-year-old boy was pulled from the rubble five days after a deadly earthquake in Nepal.

Waiting crowds roared and cheered as the teen was carried out in a stretcher. His face was covered in dust, and medics put an IV drop into his arm. A blue brace was placed around his neck. He appeared stunned, and his eyes blinked in the sunlight.



A USAID team worked at the scene for several hours to try to free the boy. USAID team leader Andrew Olvera says: "We have lights, we have generators, we have heavy breaching equipment, jackhammers, and we're trying to get him out."

The team also stuck a rotatable camera on a pole into the hole to see how best to get him out.



The site is dangerous. Olvera says it looks like it used to be a seven-story building with concrete slabs hanging down.



Olvera said before the rescue that the boy was not very deep, but he was trapped between two collapsed floors.

The teen says he survived by “good faith.”

Nepalese police officer L. B. Basnet says he spoke to the boy who gave his name as Pemba Tamang.



Basnet says: "''He thanked me when I first approached him. ... He was really responsive. He told me his name, his address, and I gave him some water. I assured him we were near to him."



The rescue operation was led by a Nepalese team with American responders from the U.S. Agency for International Development assisting them.
