Stories Of Hope Shine Through After Nepal Earthquake

BALTIMORE (WJZ) — The death toll in Nepal has risen to more than 7,200. Here in Baltimore, a family is desperately trying to reach relatives trapped in the rubble whose villages were leveled.

Tracey Leong has the story.

More than one week after the massive quake, the efforts to reach those affected is becoming increasingly difficult—but the devastated country is seeing signs of hope.

Nepal is struggling to recover as aid workers race against time to reach victims. Out of the rubble, an unbelievable story of survival: a 101-year-old man rescued more than a week after the 7.8 magnitude earthquake—but officials do not expect to find any more survivors; the death toll is expected to rise.

Troops and emergency aircraft with the United States Marines are assisting with recovery efforts.

“We are going to download these airplanes and we are going to put them out to the far reaches,” said US Marine Brig. Gen. Paul Kennedy.

Many of the hard-hit villages are in remote areas and can only be reached by air.

“It’s a landlocked country. There’s a single point of entry through the international airport,” Kennedy said. “Makes it tough.”

Mohan Thapa and his family, who now live in Baltimore, spoke to WJZ, explaining their concern with getting aid to the isolated spots.

“They need food. They don’t have any bathrooms; they are sitting on the ground. They don’t have a roof and it’s raining. They are sitting on the ground; it’s cold up in the hill,” Thapa said.

The entire country was impacted by the massive tremor. Victims sprawled across the land; many sheltered only by tents. Loved ones across the world are holding on to hope.

“More than 1,000 friends, family been affected,” Thapa said.

A Jhpiego doctor is also in Nepal, assisting with the recovery and helping more than 1,000 patients. Jhpiego is an affiliate of Johns Hopkins University.
