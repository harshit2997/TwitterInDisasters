DUSHANBE, April 28, 2015, Asia-Plus -- Tajikistan is taking measures to evacuate Tajik nationals from Nepal that was hit by devastating earthquake last Saturday.

The Tajik MFA information department says Tajik embassies in Moscow and New Delhi are currently engaged in providing safety to Tajik nationals staying in Nepal. “Tajik diplomats are in contact with them,” the source said.

According to him, the Tajik authorities will ask Russia to help evacuate Tajik nationals from Nepal.

Reuters reports that a police official said on Monday that the death toll from Nepal''s earthquake has jumped to 3,218.

The official said 6,538 people have been injured in Saturday''s quake, the worst in the country in 81 years.

The 7.9 magnitude quake reportedly made it the worst such disaster to hit Nepal since 1934 when 8,500 died.

Meanwhile, according to the latest update, the death toll might cross 10,000 mark. The disaster has been so severe that the number of the people who died in it is increasing day by day. The reason for such a rise in death toll is because many people are stuck under the debris.
