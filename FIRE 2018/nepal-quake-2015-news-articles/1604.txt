ISU Nepalese students plan vigil

POCATELLO, Idaho - Idaho State University's Nepalese Student Association will be hosting a vigil Tuesday night to raise awareness and funds for the earthquake that hit their home country.

The vigil will begin at 7 p.m. near the bronze Bengal statue on ISU's quad. At the vigil, NSA will be selling candles for $1, taking monetary donations, as well as have a computer set up for electronic donations.

The group will also have tables set up at the Pond Student Union and Rendezvous Building to collect monetary donations from 8 a.m. to 4 p.m. until Friday.

"This is the way I think we can help from our end," said Aayush Palikhel, alumni member of NSA. "That's what we're kind of focusing on what (to do), give some kind of relief. Like the basic relief that they're deprived of right now."

NSA will also be working with Dr. Fahim Rahim and the JRM Foundation with relief efforts in Nepal. Besides sending money, NSA members will be coordinating with their family members in Nepal to spread relief efforts. The plan is to reach remote areas that have yet to see any help.

"All the people are injured but we need to look at the remote places where no help is going to. We need to catch on those places and rescue those people," said Palikhel.

NSA recommends donating to the following charities' relief funds:

- American Red Cross

- GlobalGiving

- CARE

- OxFam American

- UNICEF

You can also donate to the JRM Foundation on their CrowdRise page.

If you have any questions about relief efforts or to get in contact with NSA, you can call Deepesh Poudel at (801) 803-8725 or Rajesh Jayasawal at (208) 851-1474.
