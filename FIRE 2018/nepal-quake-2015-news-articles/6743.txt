KATHMANDU, Nepal - A UH-1Y Huey arrived in Nepal to replace one of the two remaining Hueys initially deployed with Joint Task Force 505 (Forward) in support of Operation Sahayogi Haat, May 16. A second UH-1Y is expected to arrive in Nepal May 17, to replace the other remaining Huey.



The two aircraft that initially arrived in Nepal came directly from Exercise Balikatan 2015 in the Philippines. These aircraft are scheduled for routine maintenance. The arrival of these two new helicopters ensures uninterrupted support for JTF 505’s humanitarian assistance mission.



The arrival of these helicopters reinforce the sentiment that “the United States Military will remain committed to our mission here in Nepal,” which was expressed by U.S. Marine Lt. Gen. John E. Wissler, the JTF 505 commander during a press conference May 15.



JTF 505 has been supporting humanitarian aid and disaster relief operations in Nepal following the April 25 earthquake.
