A U.S. Marine Corps helicopter went missing over Nepal on Tuesday, drawing new attention to the Pentagon’s relief effort in the earthquake-ravaged country.

The UH-1Y Venom helicopter was declared missing after taking off from the town of Charikot in northeastern Nepal. The aircraft is believed to have been carrying six U.S. Marines and two Nepalese soldiers, and was delivering humanitarian aid to an area that was devastated by a 7.8-magnitude earthquake April 25 that killed more than 8,000 people.

U.S. military officials said the Marines were with Joint Task Force 505, the American unit assisting in Nepal. Nepalese troops were on the ground in the area of the helicopter’s last known location to search for it, and American and Nepalese aircraft were expected to resume aerial searches at daybreak. The helicopter disappeared the same day that another 7.3-magnitude earthquake rocked Nepal, killing dozens more people.

Charikot, in Bhimeshwar municipality, is about 80 miles from Nepal’s capital, Kathmandu, and nestled among the Himalayan Mountains.

The helicopter is a newer version of the military’s Huey, a workhorse utility aircraft that is made by Bell Helicopter and dates back to the 1950s. It also is known as the Super Huey or the Yankee, after the “Y” in its variant name. It is built for a variety of missions, and has seen service everywhere from Afghanistan to the Pacific since it was adopted in 2008.

The U.S. military task force in Nepal now numbers in the hundreds, and was activated May 1.

U.S. military officials said in a tweet Tuesday that the Pentagon has three UH-1Y helicopters in the country. It also has four MV-22B Osprey tilt-rotor aircraft, two KC-130J cargo planes and at least four C-17 Globemaster planes flying missions as part of Operation Sahayogi Haat, the relief effort. The name means “helping hand” in Nepali, military officials said.
