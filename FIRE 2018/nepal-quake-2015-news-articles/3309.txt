CUTTACK: National Disaster Response Force (NDRF)'s Collapsed Structure Search And Rescue (CSRR) team has proved its mettle in carrying out rescue operations in earthquake-devastated Nepal, claimed NDRF officials here.The CSSR teams, equipped with hi-tech equipment, are not only tracing alive persons under heaps of rubble but also providing immediate medical treatment to those rescued, said commandant of NDRF Munduli battalion M K Yadav.Three teams from Munduli battalion, located on the outskirts of Cuttack, are on standby to rush to Nepal. Yadav said the CSSR teams are equipped with life detector machines, which are fitted with sensors that can detect heartbeats 4 to 5 metres under concrete rubble, video cameras, which can be put into holes to locate survivors, sniffer dogs, drilling and concrete cutting machines that can precisely and accurately cut heavy sheets of concrete within seconds."On directions from headquarters, we have readied our three CSSR teams, each comprising 45 personnel, for carrying out rescue operations in Nepal. But due to bad weather and congestion at Nepal airport, we are yet to get the go-ahead," said Yadav."All our equipment is packed and on receiving orders from headquarters we will immediately be airlifted to Nepal," said Yadav.Ten CSSR units are currently deployed in Nepal and so far, they have rescued over a dozen persons from under debris and pulled out 50 dead bodies from the rubble, claimed officials.Each CSSR team has three components: search, rescue and medical help. Among the 45 members, there are doctors who are trained to provide immediate medical help to quake victims, technical experts, sniffer dogs, and a team of rescuers.who in no time can dig into heaps of debris. "We have to be very careful while carrying out rescue operations as there is chance that the debris may cave inside while cutting and suffocate the survivor. It needs precision and expertise to carry out such operations," said Yadav. NDRF officials said Nepal government has been using earthmovers to remove debris and retrieving the injured manually, but the entire procedure is very time consuming as there is debris everywhere."Our hi-tech CSSR teams have definitely expedited the rescue work," said Yadav. Notably, the disaster response force was formed in 2006, after the devastating Tsunami hit India in 2004. EOM
