SUBANG: The Education Ministry welcomes the call of the Sultan of Johor, Sultan Ibrahim Sultan Iskandar to emulate Singapore's education system with English as the medium of instruction.

Its Deputy Education Minister II, P. Kamalanathan said the ministry has always given emphasis on strengthening the use of the English language in the education system and now with the Sultan's call, the whole ministry appreciates and welcomes the idea.

"Of course we welcome and appreciate what the Sultan of Johor has called for, but I would also like remind the people that the government has always done its best in strengthening the English language in our education system.

"For instance we can take the policy of a compulsory pass in English in the SPM examinations starting next year," Kamalanathan told reporters after attending the Megatech Nepal Earthquake Relief donation here today.

He also pointed out that it is mentioned in the current education system, that importance will be given in improving students' dual language (Bahasa Melayu and English) knowledge as the national language is regarded as an equally important subject.

Meanwhile, commenting on Mara scholar Nur Fitri Azmeer Nordin who was convicted for possession of child pornography in the United Kingdom, Kamalanathan said priority should be placed on rehabilitating him.

"My way of dealing with this type of student is by rehabilitating him and then we look forward on how is he answerable for his crime.

"Saying that, of course I will never tolerate such a crime if it happens again, but first, rehab this type of individual," he added.

Earlier, Kamalanathan attended the Megatech International College's official launch of the Megatech Nepal Earthquake Relief at its Subang Jaya campus.

The college donated RM1,000,000 worth of 20 full scholarships together with RM20,000 worth of donation goods to the Nepalese Embassy.

Also present at the event were Special Envoy to India and South Asia for Infrastructure, Datuk Seri Dr. S. Samy Vellu and Nepal's Ambassador to Malaysia, Dr. Niranjan Man Singh Basnyat.
