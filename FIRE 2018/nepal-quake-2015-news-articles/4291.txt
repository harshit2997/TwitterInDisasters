The Sundaram Parambil family of Pollethai, near Kattoor, is anxiously awaiting the return of Sarath Kumar, 27, who has been stranded in quake-hit Nepal.

His father, Sasi Kumar, says Sarath had gone to Nepal on April 17 to recruit people for a restaurant he planned to establish at Varkala.

Call on quake day

He had called home on Saturday, the day the earthquake struck Nepal. Sarath assured his family of his safety and also spoke of the disastrous situation in the country.

He said that he was trying to return to India within a day.

He called his parents the following day also, when Nepal witnessed aftershocks. Since then, his parents have not received any calls from Nepal.

However, they got word from their daughter, Sangeetha, that Sarath had called her on her cell phone on Wednesday noon.

But they only had a brief conversation, due to an erratic phone connection, during which Sarath said that he was at Pokhara in northwestern Nepal.

Text message

She soon received an SMS from her brother, who told her that he was safe and hoped to return home in 10 days. The family’s hopes are now pinned on the Union government’s efforts in bringing back Indians stranded in Nepal to safety.
