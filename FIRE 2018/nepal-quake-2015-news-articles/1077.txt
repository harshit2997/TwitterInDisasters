The death toll from yesterday’s earthquake has reached to 1,900 while hundreds of others are still unaccounted for in Nepal.

Hundreds of bodies and wounded have been delivered to the hospital in Kathmandu and more are still coming.

Officials confirm the death toll is recorded 1,896 but feared it can raise as hundreds of some 4,700 injured are in critical condition and hundreds of others are still unaccounted for.

The rescue operation is ongoing with high pace by government rescue teams as well as civilians.

Last night rescuers were removing the debris of a damaged building in Kathmandu with axes and bared hands because bulldozers could not go through the narrow streets to get to the site.

Rescuers said that they believe people were still being trapped in the debris of the collapsed building.

Doctors and nurses are working tirelessly in the hospital. A doctor told reporters “I am tired and exhausted, but I have to work and have the strength.”

The earthquake scaled 7.9 magnitude on Richter stuck Nepal in midday on Sunday. The earthquake has also left 44 people killed in Nepal’s neighboring India.

India, Pakistan, U.S. and Britain have announced assistance to Nepal, a poor country with damaged economy.
