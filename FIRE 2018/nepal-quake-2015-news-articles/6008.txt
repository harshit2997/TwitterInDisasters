Shropshire paramedic gives up holiday in Turkey to aid Nepal quake efforts

Ed Hullah, who is based in Craven Arms, has decided to swap his all-inclusive holiday next week for a self-funded trip to Nepal.

Ed said: "I had been planning a last-minute holiday to Turkey and thought that it might be an idea to go and render aid and care in the disaster zone instead. As I looked into it, I became more determined.

"I will arrive in Kathmandu, then go to the offices of the Nepal Red Cross Society where I will join a medical unit. Then I'll be sent to wherever I'm needed."

Ed has paid for the trip himself and medical supplies company SP Services, based in Hortonwood, Telford, is helping with equipment.

Ed is also fundraising to buy more medical supplies. To help with a donation visit www.gofundme.com/medicalaidfornepal
