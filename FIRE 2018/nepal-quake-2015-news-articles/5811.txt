Indian volunteers from all walks of life have come all the way to quake-hit Nepal to help the hapless and heal the injured, and to assist in the ongoing rescue operations.

The Himalayan nation was hit by a devastating earthquake on April 25, killing more than 6,000 people and injuring over 10,000.

Doctors, NGO team and Delhi Sikh Gurudwara Management Committee volunteers arrived in the disaster-hit country to expedite the rescue process and help the quake survivors.

Besides, anxious relatives have also started arriving here.

Mukesh Shah, a 24-year Nepali student staying in Delhi, also reached Kathmandu on Friday.

"I could not arrive earlier as tickets were not available last week," he said.

Shah is, however, relieved that his family - his mother, father and sister - are safe.

"When the quake struck, my sister was at home. My parents were outside," he added.

Smitha Segu, a doctor from Bangalore Medical College, has arrived with a team of doctors to treat the quake survivors, most of whom have sustained injuries from crashing objects during the quake.

Segu, a plastic surgeon, has come to Nepal with a team of two plastic surgeons, two orthopedicians, one pediatrician and one general surgeon.

"Those who received critical injuries would require the attention of plastic surgeons and orthopedicians," she said.

Her team will help the quake victims in close coordination with a Kathmandu-based hospital.

Randeep Matthew from Community Outreach Centre, an NGO in Chandigarh, has arrived in Nepal with a team of 11 people, which consists of doctors. The team is also carrying medicines.

Matthew said that the team plans to visit remote areas like Nakipur, where the rescue work has not picked much pace.

"We will distribute foods and tents to all," he said.

The Delhi Sikh Gurudwara Management Committee (DSGMC) members are also camping in the disaster-struck country. They will distribute blankets and organise 'langar' - free kitchen.

"We came here with a feeling of serving the quake hit people," Kulvir Singh of the DSGMC said.

Besides, a 48-year-old Church worker, Navina Thomas, also came from Abu Dhabi to lend a helping hand to the affected people.
