PETALING JAYA: There is a ray of light for the Rainbow of Life Forces (ROLF), which took 100 Nepali children under its wing last month.

Apparently in Nayapati, Kathmandu, the children would read their books, guided by the flickering flames of candles and lamps. This was their routine even in the aftermath of the earthquake.

Inside their sanctuary, the children are oblivious to the anxiety of their elders, who are frantically seeking access to food, clean water and other essentials.

“They are safe but their hometown is a mess. Power outages and road damage have practically cut off the town from its facilities, making it harder to communicate with them,” said Adelyn Lim, founder of ROLF.

ROLF is a Malaysian initiative aimed at fulfilling wishes. For its Nepal base, ROLF collaborated with the Drikung Kagyu Rinchen Ling Monastery in Nayapati to grant wishes to underprivileged children.

Lim had initially received reports that some of the children were missing after the earthquake.

Thankfully, a call from the monastery late Sunday informed her that all 100 children were accounted for.

“I am trying to get airline companies to help us transport the essentials to Kathmandu,” said Lim.



ROLF has granted the wishes of the children, who had asked for books, stationery and schoolbags.



The Nepal embassy in Malaysia will have a Disaster Relief Fund Nepal to raise funds for the rebuilding of the country. Nepali ambassador to Malaysia Dr Niranjan Man Singh Basnyat said the people there were sleeping in the open because they were still scared of aftershocks.

“The embassy will liaise with Nepal Airlines, Malaysia Airlines, AirAsia and Malindo Air to send the essentials to our people,” he said.

Dr Basnyat noted that there were 850,000 Nepalese workers in Malaysia so he hoped their employers would give them a one-month advance salary to help their families back home.

Malaysian Red Crescent Society secretary-general Datuk Sayed A. Rahman Sayed Mohd said they would send US$10,000 (RM35,600) to Red Cross Nepal, besides seeking public donations.

Contributions can be sent to the Malaysian Red Crescent Society through its Maybank account 5144-2210-2657 or via cheques for the Nepal earthquake relief fund.

Malaysians have been asked to refrain from donating items such as foodstuff, clothes or blankets as transporting them would be costly.

The Tzu Chi Foundation is also sending a 15-member disaster survey and medical team there led by Dr Chien Shou Hsin, Superintendent of Taichung Tzu Chi Hospital and Dr Zhao You Cheng, Superintendent of Taipei Tzu Chi Hospital.
