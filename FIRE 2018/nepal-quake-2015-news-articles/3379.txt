Nepal earthquake: NZ Parliament marks tragedy
</headline>

<text>
Acting Prime Minister Bill English told Parliament that New Zealand stood with the international community in readiness to help.

"There is immense goodwill between New Zealand and Nepal based on our links through Sir Edmund Hillary and the ongoing work of the Hillary Trust.

"We have announced an initial contribution of $1 million to the immediate relief effort, and we will continue to assess how we can further assist both in the short term and in the coming years. Because as we know from our own experience, recovery takes a long time."

Three consular staff had been sent to Kathmandu to provide assistance to New Zealanders, and the wellbeing of 236 Kiwis had been confirmed.

"On behalf of this House and all New Zealanders, I extend our condolences to Prime Minister of Nepal Sushil Koirala and the Nepalese people during this difficult time. We also offer our condolences to all of those affected in Bangladesh, China, India and Pakistan."

Acting Labour leader Annette King said the party's thoughts went out to the Nepalese people who had suffered after the earthquake, and to those of New Zealanders still missing in the country.

"I do believe there is more we could and should do, and I look forward to hearing what further contribution the Government will make. But, also, I urge New Zealanders to dig deep and donate whatever they can."
