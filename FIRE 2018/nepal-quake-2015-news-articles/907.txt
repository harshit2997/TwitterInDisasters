On Saturday (April 25) a 7.8 magnitude earthquake hit Nepal near its capital city of Kathmandu, according to the New York Times. The death toll stood at over 1,300 people as of press time. Additionally, it led to 34 deaths in Northern India and at least 10 deaths on Mount Everest in avalanches triggered by the earthquake.

Among those who died on Mount Everest is Google executive Dan Fredinburg. His sister confirmed the news on social media. Fredinburg was head of privacy for Google X. He reportedly sustained a major head injury in the avalanche. He was remembered by actress Sophia Bush (who is reportedly his ex-girlfriend) as well as Scooter Braun on social media.

Rest in peace to a great guy I had the pleasure of knowing @danfredinburg. He was just an all around great human being and he will be missed -- Scooter Braun (@scooterbraun) April 25, 2015

My prayers go out to Dan's family and all those that lost someone today in Nepal. @danfredinburg you will be missed by many. #greathuman -- Scooter Braun (@scooterbraun) April 25, 2015

Celebrities like Pink and Kevin have also taken to social media to share various ways people can help those affected by the earthquake.
