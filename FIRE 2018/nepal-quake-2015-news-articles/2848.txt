After initially deciding to continue their trek, Ottawa charity trekking group Dream Mountains Foundation has decided to leave Nepal and come home.

Team leader and Ottawa restaurant owner Shawn Dawson announced the team's decision in a Facebook post Monday.

"I just want you all to know officially we are making plans to come home," wrote Dawson.

He followed up with another post announcing 17 of the team members were already on flights. The remaining five, including Dawson, are expected to follow.

"We appreciate beyond words the love and support we have received from our friends and family from around the world," said Dawson.

The team was in Kathmandu on Saturday preparing for a hike to Everest base camp when the 7.8 magnitude earthquake hit.

No one on the team was injured.

The deadly earthquake was felt as far as India, including numerous aftershocks that followed. As of Tuesday, the death toll rose past the 5,000 mark.

It's considered to be one of the most devastating earthquakes to hit the region in the past 80 years.

On Sunday, the group had announced they planned on attempting their hike to Everest base camp. But come Monday, the team decided to call it quits.

The groupâ€™s expected to arrive in Ottawa at noon Wednesday.

But one Ottawa man, filmmaker Elia Saikaly, remains on Mount Everest in the middle of rescue efforts and devastation.

Saikaly says he's physically drained after being on the mountain when the earthquake triggered a deadly avalanche Saturday, killing hundreds.

"I'm worn down and emotionally drained from the events of the past 72 hours," Saikaly wrote in a Facebook update Tuesday. "I've been slowly falling apart physically."

Saikaly was on the mountain filming an adventure project. His footage captured the avalanche as it hit base camp.

As for Saikaly's return, he doesn't say but confirmed he will continue his film project on the mountain.
