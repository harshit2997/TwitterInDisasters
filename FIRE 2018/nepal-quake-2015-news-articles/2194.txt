GRAND RAPIDS, Mich. (WOOD) — With communications down following Saturday’s magnitude 7.8 earthquake, many Nepalese living in West Michigan have yet to hear from loved ones in their home country.

Close to 80 Nepalese gather at Thornapple Covenant Church in Grand Rapids each Sunday for services. This week, they prayed pray for home. Most had not heard from family members still in Nepal.

“Basically no communication,” minister Ram Aaryal said. “The road blocks are that Skype doesn’t work, Internet doesn’t work and the phone doesn’t work, the land line doesn’t work.”

The earthquake and its aftershocks killed more than 3,200 people. Thousands more were hurt and many are missing.

“It’s very devastating. It’s shocking. It’s sad,” Aaryal said. “We do have hope in the Lord Jesus Christ. We do not understand, but he is in the process of redeeming the whole wide world.”

Aaryal is from a town about 40 miles northwest of Nepal’s capital Kathmandu, where he says centuries-old buildings have crumbled to the ground. He said he received a Facebook message from a relative saying none of his immediate family was injured in the earthquake.

He is now relying on prayer for those in his country who have lost loved ones and lives, and for members of his congregation who are still waiting to learn their family members’ fate.

“I would like to pray this morning and ask God that he would comfort us,” he said. “I would like to ask the Grand Rapids church community to please continue to pray for our people.”
