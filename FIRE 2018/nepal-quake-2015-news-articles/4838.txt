Maryknoll’s Work in Nepal: Father Joe Thaler Helps People Displaced by the Earthquake
</headline>

<text>
He was spared during the earthquake that struck more than one week ago as he was not in the country. But, he has found a way to return quickly to Nepal to aid the factory workers he serves, displaced Kamaiya children and women, and the disabled whom he also serves.

In messages from Father Thaler, the Maryknoll Fathers and Brothers has learned that his staff and many working partners “are camping out in the fields or streets…and living with a lot of fear and terror due to the continual aftershocks and not a clear vision of what will happen next.”



According to the Maryknoll priest, one of his employees has lost his home. Father Thaler’s home still stands within a neighborhood of downed buildings but it has numerous cracks. He said that the cremation fires burn constantly.



Father Thaler is from Cold Spring, Kentucky, and was ordained into the Maryknoll Society during 1977. He advised that “the immediate needs are for medical supplies, tents, tarps, mattresses, blankets, water and food items…. For the long term, the money will be needed for repairs and rebuilding the homes of the people. For sure we can’t rebuild all of the homes, but even to do a few to help some people will be very significant.”

The Maryknoll Fathers and Brothers follow Jesus in serving the poor and others in need in 26 countries that include the U.S. All Catholics are called to mission through baptism and confirmation, and Maryknoll’s mission education outreach in parishes and schools throughout the country engages U.S. Catholics in mission through vocations, prayer, donations and as volunteers. Maryknoll missioners share God’s love and the Gospel in combating poverty, providing healthcare, building communities and promoting human rights.
