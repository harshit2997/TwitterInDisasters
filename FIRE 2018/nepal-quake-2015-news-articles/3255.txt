Members of both Houses of legislature on Monday unanimously decided to contribute one month’s salary for relief work in Nepal.

Some members even suggested that a portion of the Local Area Development fund allocated to each member could be donated for the purpose.

In the Assembly, Deputy Speaker N.H. Shivashankara Reddy moved the obituary reference and expressed deep grief over the death of over 4,000 people in the earthquake in Nepal and north Indian States.

Revenue Minister V. Srinivas Prasad has urged members of the Lower House to come forward to donate their month’s salary as well as funds from the Local Area Development fund. Leader of the Opposition Jagadish Shettar agreed to the suggestion.

In the Council, Chairman D.H. Shankaramurthy moved the obituary reference. Minister S.R. Patil, Leader of the Opposition K.S. Eshwarappa and V.S. Ugrappa of the Congress spoke and expressed grief over the tragedy.

A minute’s silence was observed in both Houses as a mark of respect for the dead.
