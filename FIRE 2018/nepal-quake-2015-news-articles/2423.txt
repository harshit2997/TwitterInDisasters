Global effort to help Nepal victims kicks into high gear

LONDON (AP) — Emergency aid flights are set to land shortly in Nepal to try to locate and rescue earthquake victims as governments and agencies promise more help.

The Asian Development Bank announced a $3 million grant to Nepal Monday to help provide desperately needed tents, medicine, food and water.

Spain’s government planned to send a chartered jet to Nepal loaded with tons of donated aid from the government and charities, including material to build water storage distribution points and latrines, tarps for shelters plus blankets and cooking sets for more than 500 families.

Mariona Minet of Spain’s Oxfam Intermon said many people are still frightened and sleeping on the streets, in part because of aftershocks.

A British Royal Air Force plane loaded with aid was also expected to arrive in Nepal Monday.
