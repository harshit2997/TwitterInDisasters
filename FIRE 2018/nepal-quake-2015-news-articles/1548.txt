BANGKOK, 26 April 2015 â€“ The Royal Thai Air Force has prepared aircrafts and personnel to help the earthquake-hit Nepal. They are expected to depart for the country after the air force receives an official order from the government.

Spokesman of the air force ACM Monthon Satchukorn on Sunday said the air force had not yet been contacted by the government to provide assistance for Nepal where a magnitude 7.8 quake struck on 25 April 2015. Nevertheless, the air force was closely monitoring the situation and preparing for a Nepal departure, the spokesman said.

The air force was waiting for the government to decide which humanitarian missions, such as material and medical assistance, it would operate for Nepal. It could assist the country immediately if the government ordered, the spokesman added.
