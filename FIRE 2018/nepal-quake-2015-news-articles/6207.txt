All Hallows Catholic School held a fundraiser Mufti Day to raise money for the people of Nepal on Wednesday.

Nepal was devastated by an enormous earthquake last month and the children of All Hallows wanted to help.

Sascha Fuller, a past pupil, told the children about her experiences living in Nepal and life in a small village in the Gorkha province.

Her photos made the children aware of the very different life these people have and the way the earthquake has devastated their lives.

Everyone thinks in terms of loss of life and buildings, but as Sascha pointed out, they have also lost their food stores, crops which were getting close to harvest, their buffalo and goats (their milk and meat sources), and their tourism industry which brings income into the country.

All Hallows children are justifiably proud that they raised $394 for the appeal.

The school also to celebrated their mothers with a beautiful Mother's Day Liturgy, joined by mothers, grandmothers and other special women.
