Nepal earthquakes: Queensland researchers develop siphon to protect Himalayan villages from glacial floods earthquakes

Posted

Queensland researchers have designed a siphon they say could help save Himalayan villages from being flooded by glacial water during earthquakes.

Lakes on top of mountains are contained by glacial walls, but during earthquakes those walls can crack, sending kilotons of water towards villages bellow.

Queensland University of Technology researcher Dr Stephen Hughes developed the siphon and tested it during experiments in Bhutan.

It works by placing the N shaped tube in the lake, it then fills up with water and a one way valve is used to release the water at the bottom of the mountain.

It is designed to be an uncomplicated and affordable tool that could be used easily in remote regions.

Dr Hughes, who has been studying glacial lakes for 20 years, hoped to return to Bhutan to show locals how to use it, and will undertake further experiments at Lake Manchester near Brisbane.

The glacial lake bursts, also known as inland tsunamis, have destroyed Himalayan communities.

In 2012, one swept through two villages and Nepal's second largest city, Pokhara, killing up to 60 people and changing the course of the Seti River Dr Hughes said.

"I did a calculation of a glacial lake outburst in 1994 and the destructive power that came in the water of the lake was the equivalent of eight atomic bombs dropped on Hiroshima," he said.

"It's an enormous destructive force."

Geology Lecturer at University of Canterbury in New Zealand, Dr Stefan Winkler has studied glaciers around the world and compared their force to tsunamis.

"With most outbursts, very large amounts of water are released in a short amount of time, the flood waves can be several metres high," he said.
