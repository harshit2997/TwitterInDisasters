Nepal-India earthquake complete coverage

AHMEDABAD: For Gujarati survivors of the fatal bus accident in Nepal, it was like out of the frying pan into the fire. First, their ill-fated bus plunged some 100 metres down from the hilly road in Dhading district of Nepal killing 14 Gujarati pilgrims on April 22. Then the nature pulled the rug from under them in the form of quake.Ranchod Parmar, 52, one of the six accident critically injured admitted to Kathmandu's Norvic International Hospital, ran out of his ward wearing hospital pajamas as a powerful 7.9-magnitude earthquake shook Nepal capital on Saturday. He was not brought to Ahmedabad as he was not fit to be airlifted. Fear of quake, however, forced the critically injured to run for life, again!The scurrying patients gathered in the hospital's parking lot where the administration spread thin mattresses on the ground for them.Back home, emotions also ran high in Ahmedabad Civil Hospital where Parmar's wife Savita â€” one of the survivors in the accident, is being treated, along with four others."Ranchodbhai told me over phone that it was initially a loud banging, followed by rumbling, and intense shaking. He didn't know what it was. After hearing shrieks of other hospital occupants, he ran for cover. He didn't know what it was until somebody in the crowd shouted earthquake," Savita told TOI.Savita, however, thanked her stars that she was evacuated in a special plane of Indian Air Force and brought to Ahmedabad.Parmar's son Hitesh said: "My father was so scared that he was shivering even hours after the tremors stopped." Hitesh said his father told him that the hospital had withstood the deadly earthquake, but there were several cracks in the building. As tremors continued jolting Kathmandu, hundreds of people scurried out of their wards and assembled on the streets.
