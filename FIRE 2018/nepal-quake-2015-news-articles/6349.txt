Wellington Faith and Ethnic groups to pray for Nepal

Call for Wellington Faith and Ethnic groups to support and pray for Nepal

On Sunday 24th of May, St Andrews on the Terrace and the Wellington Nepalese Society will come together with faith and ethnic communities for Wellington's Candlelit Vigil for Nepal calling upon those from all ethnic and faith communities to support their brothers and sisters suffering in Nepal.

Coordinator Robert Mackay from the Council for a Parliament of the World's Religions received an urgent call for support from a friend in Nepal. Mr Mackay said the "sheer scale of damage and loss of life is hard to bear for many in the Buddhist and Hindu communities both here and abroad. Their loss is made worse by the fact that so many of the historical and holy shrines been damaged'.

Former Rotary exchange student Nirjan Shakya who is currently living in Kathmandu and assisting with the relief effort has called upon New Zealanders to assist in any way they can as the situation becomes desperate in Nepal after the second earthquake struck on the 12th of May.

Mr Shakya in a conversation with Mr Mackay reported that "the the situation is getting worse - many many many houses are gone now and there is now continuous rainfall with hail and lightening. All the ICUs and post operation theatres in hospitals are not functioning with the overflow of patients and they are having to operate in the open".

Mr Mackay stated that "the candlelit vigil would be an opportunity for Wellingtonians from faith, spiritual and ethnic backgrounds and anyone else interested to come together, reflect, hear stories of what is happening in Nepal and to donate to the New Zealand Red Cross and Unicef Nepal Appeals".
