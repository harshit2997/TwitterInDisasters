China is organizing emergency aid for Nepal while trying to bring Chinese citizens home.

At the request of the Chinese embassy in Nepal, 1,500 Chinese tourists have already been transported from Kathmandu to China. 500 Chinese nationals are still stranded at the airport and the embassy is coordinating with airlines to bring them home.



"We continue to work with the major airlines to speed up the evacuation of Chinese nationals. Meanwhile, we continue to offer our embassy as a temporary shelter to them," said Cheng Ji, consular to China embassy in Nepal.

"The embassy also realizes there's a lack of basic necessities here in Nepal so we bought food and drinking water for people who are staying here. The Chinese international rescue team has arrived in Kathmandu and started rescue work. A Chinese medical team has also travelled from another city in Nepal to Kathmandu and they're administrating aid and help here."
