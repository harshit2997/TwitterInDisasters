ETAH (UP): Controversy prone BJP MP Sakshi Maharaj today kicked up another row when he called Rahul Gandhi "mad" while trying to ridicule the Congress Vice President's attempts to reach out to distressed farners in the recent days. Maharaj also compared Prime Minister Narendra Modi with Lord Krishna, saying like Krishna saved Draupadi, he rescued Nepal.

Taking a dig at Gandhi, the BJP MP from Unnao said he does not know the difference between wheat and maize.

"I say that Rahul Gandhi has gone mad. He does not known the ABCD of politics. He is talking of farmers but does not know the difference between wheat and maize," Maharaj said addressing a meeting at Amroli Ratanpur village.

While referring to the rescue and rehabilitation efforts launched by the NDA government in quake-hit Nepal, Maharaj said," after the devastation in Nepal, Modi reacted without hesitation. Similarly, Krishna had helped Draupadi when she needed it without hesitation. Modi has done the work of saving Nepal like Lord Krishna."

On the agrarian crisis, Maharaj said the Uttar Pradesh government has failed to address this problem in the state and that the funds allocated by Central government to the distressed farmers have not reached them.

He also hit out at the state government for propagating "goondaraj".

"There is goondaraj in Uttar Pradesh. The law and order situation here is in complete shambles. The Akhilesh Yadav government failed to pay any attention to the farmers affected by unseasonal rain and hailstorms. Crores of rupees were allocated by the Centre for the aggrieved farmers but the relief did not reach them," he said.

The saffron-clad MP noted that an enquiry will be initiated by the Centre over non-distribution of relief money to the farmers.

Defending the Modi government on Land Acquisition bill, the BJP MP said the law is in the interest of farmers.

Praising Prime Minister Modi for putting India on the path of development, he said the country's borders are safe under the watchful eyes of Modi.

"Our borders are safe and secure and very soon the people will realise that we are progressing in every field. India will soon be known as a super power around the globe," he said.

Maharaj also said Modi is working for the overall development of the country. "Our country is safe under his watchful eyes" he added.
