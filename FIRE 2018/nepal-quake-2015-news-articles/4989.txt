DALLAS/FORT WORTH AIRPORT – Waiting is never easy. Sharon Banks will tell you that.

"Everybody is coming out but her," she said while nervously shifting in her sandals at the Dallas/Forth Worth International Airport Saturday evening.

Time couldn't tick fast enough for the mother of four. Her youngest was heading home after a deadly earthquake left the 22-year-old stranded on the world's tallest mountain across the globe.

"I just want to see her," cried out Banks outside international baggage claim.

Rescuers airlifted Danielle Banks off Mount Everest. For days, her mom didn't know if she her daughter was alive. The natural disaster cut off communication.

"Hopefully she doesn't go out of the country for a while," she added. "Let my heart recuperate some."

Minutes later, her heart jumped. The doors opened and her youngest child came into view, and she ran forward with open arms.

Danielle Banks, a recent Texas A&M graduate, took off for Nepal in March to volunteer with a group empowering human trafficking victims.

She never imagined the horror that would unfold when she took off for a once-in-a-lifetime climb.

"Buildings were collapsing," she recalled. "People were screaming. It was like a war zone. When we finally helicoptered out, just looking over it, I realized how serious the situation was because every building was collapsed."

Nearly 7,000 people lost their lives.

Banks is one of the lucky ones – lucky to dodge death and come back to a country with a history of standing strong.

"Nepal has really taught me a lot about privilege and just how fortunate we are to be born in a first world country where if a disaster happens, we're not calling in other countries to assist us," said Danielle Banks. "We take care of our own."

Banks says she wants to round up a group of Texas A&M grads to head back to Nepal hopefully around Spring Break and help with the long process of rebuilding.
