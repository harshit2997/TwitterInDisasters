Ottawa community relief efforts scheduled in support of Nepal

Ottawans are continuing their efforts to help provide assistance and relief to Nepal after the country was devastated by an earthquake on April 25.

The quake killed more than 7,000 people, and has caused massive damage. This weekend, different communities around Ottawa are gathering to host fundraising events.

#OttNepalRelief

Local artists of all kinds are congregating Friday for a fundraising benefit.

#OttNepalRelief is a benefit being hosted at the ByWard Market’s Zaphod Beeblebrox.

Sans Foulard, Big Jeezus Truck and The Sonic Defense will take the stage along with Johnny Vegas, a former staple of Ottawa’s club scene.

In addition to the bands, DJ Garry Armitage and DJ Lowpass will be providing music.

The event will also feature a raffle and silent auction featuring pieces from local artists and packages from local businesses.

“Pretty much everyone knows what’s happening in Nepal, but is powerless to do anything except help the people who are already there trying to help,” said Eugene Haslam, the owner of Zaphod Beeblebrox.

He said he wanted to raise money for charities that had boots on the ground and knew the situation, so the proceeds are going to Doctors Without Borders and the Canadian Red Cross.

“There’s a lot of Ottawans who feel powerless to do anything,” said Haslam. He encouraged people to support any fundraiser they can.

The doors will open for the event at 8 p.m on Friday. Cover charge is $10, which goes to the relief efforts.

Pray for Nepal

Ottawa’s Nepali community is banding together to send support to family and friends in Nepal.

Shreena Thapa is a Nepali-Canadian. She said that learning about the earthquake was “shocking and heartbreaking.”

She and other Nepali youth banded together to organize a bazaar fundraiser at City Hall on Saturday featuring local artists, as well as traditional Nepali food, performances and a henna art station.

“It’s our way of showing our support and letting the people in Nepal know that we do care,” said Thapa. “Right now they really need our help and support, and if we don’t do this immediately then you really don’t know what will happen as time goes by.”

The fundraiser will take place from 11 a.m. to 5 p.m. with the funds going to aid agencies in Nepal.
