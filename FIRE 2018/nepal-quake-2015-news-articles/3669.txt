Thiruvananthapura: Two doctors from Kerala perished in the Nepal earthquake, it was confirmed late on Tuesday, as the state government contacted authorities in Delhi and Kathmandu to bring their bodies back home.

However, the task of flying the bodies home may take a while longer as the priority at the moment for the rescue and relief operations teams in Kathmandu, is to search for more victims and save as many lives as possible.

Meanwhile, chief minister Oommen Chandy announced aid of Rs20 million (Dh1.15 million) from the state government towards the relief operations in Nepal.

The two doctors who died in the quake, Dr A.S. Irshad from Kasaragod, and Dr Deepak Thomas from Kannur, both aged 24 and classmates at the Kozhikode Medical College, had gone to Kathmandu on a short holiday with another college mate, Dr Abin Suri, ahead of undertaking post-graduate courses.

Local media reported that the three doctors had planned a quick holiday trip as there was a delay in the commencement of their post-graduation classes.

Tragedy struck when the hotel where they were staying in, collapsed in the earthquake.

The leisure trip cost two of them their lives.

Suri was rescued with serious injuries to his kidneys and was admitted to the All India Institute of Medical Sciences in Delhi on Wednesday morning after being flown in to Delhi.

The Kerala government has announced that it would bear the medical expenses for Suriâ€™s treatment.

Dozens of Keralites, who were in Nepal at the time of the earthquake have returned home, and others still stuck in that country are being assisted in their return.
