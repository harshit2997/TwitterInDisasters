Three New Zealand Red Cross aid workers have left for earthquake struck Nepal today.

The New Zealand Red Cross emergency response unit (ERU) consisting of three telecommunications specialists was deployed for Kathmandu to establish local communication networks to help ensure the smooth flow of information in the operation.

Don Wallace and Ewan Coldicott from Wellington, and Thomas McNally from Auckland are taking over 300kg of IT and telecommunications equipment with them, including HF and VHF radios, satellite communications and also equipment to set up computer networks.

The trio will be completely self-sufficient, carrying their own tents, food and water filtration systems, and itâ€™s envisaged they will stay in the field for a month.

New Zealand Red Cross established the IT and Telecommunications ERU in 2000 and has previously deployed to the Haiti earthquake and the Philippines after Typhoon Haiyan. Individual members have responded to Pacific disasters and Tunisia after the spring uprising.

Six other Red Cross ERU units have been dispatched from around the world including a rapid deployment hospital, two basic health care units, two logistical units and one emergency relief unit.

Further New Zealand Red Cross aid workers will be deployed in the coming days to assist with the response.

New Zealand Red Cross has launched an appeal in support of the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies to deliver urgent life-saving aid to those most in need.

The appeal will allow the Red Cross to provide critical, life-saving support such as emergency shelter and basic household items, emergency health and care including psychosocial support, livelihoods support, dignified burials and restoring family links services.

The New Zealand Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade has donated $1million to support the Red Cross emergency appeal.
