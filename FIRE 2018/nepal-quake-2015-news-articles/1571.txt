Nepal is a scene of destruction following Saturday's 7.8 earthquake that shook the region. Now aid workers are deploying to help in recovery efforts.

Las Vegas members of RescueNet, an international volunteer organization aiding in relief work, are going to to lend a hand.

Dave Mansfield, RescueNet North America Coordinator, said RescueNet volunteers will do whatever it takes to help people in need.

"We have compassionate people that are willing to drop everything at a moment's notice and say, 'Yes, I need to be there,'" Mansfield said.

Fifteen RescueNet volunteers are on their way to Nepal. They're unsure how long they'll be there to help.

Reports find 2,500 people died in the quake, but those numbers are expected to rise.

"This is just the beginning. They're only getting the early counts and in the urban areas. So we know it's going to rise. We know there's a need and on top of that the government has asked for international aid," said Mansfield.

RescueNet volunteers will provide search and rescue support, medical care, trauma counseling and childcare.

"Often the kids are the ones that are overlooked and the most vulnerable because either they've lost their parents or their parents are looking for supplies, food, shelter, things like that. It's a pretty scary world out there for the kids," Mansfield explained.

RescueNet plans to send teams to surrounding villages and work with other aid organizations to provide victims with the best care.

"We'll go out and do a survey in that area, treat the immediate needs, bring the report back so some larger agencies can maybe send out a longer term team. We can come back, restock, go out to another village for a few days, come back, restock, go out to another village," Mansfield said.

RescueNet is on a mission to reach as many people as possible in need of help.

"We have well trained people that are willing to go as far out as we possibly can to reach those that aren't getting reached," said Mansfield.

RescueNet is a volunteer organization that relies on donations to support their relief work.
