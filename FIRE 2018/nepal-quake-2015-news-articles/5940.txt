</headline>

<text>
The government dispatched the second batch of the Korea Disaster Response Team (KDRT) to quake-ravaged Nepal on Friday.



Seoul's Foreign Ministry announced that the 32-member team is made up of 15 search and rescue workers, 15 medical experts and two additional staff members.



The ministry said the rescue workers will be working in Bhaktapur, some 15 kilometers east of Kathmandu, joining the ten-member KDRT team already operating in the region.



The medical personnel will be stationed at the Nepal-Korea Friendship Hospital in Thimi for around ten days, before being replaced by another team of about ten medical workers.



The ministry also plans to provide 21-thousand makeshift shelters and ten-thousand blankets for displaced Nepalese.
