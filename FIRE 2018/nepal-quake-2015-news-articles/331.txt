A 7.9-magnitude earthquake has struck Nepal and India, killing at least four people. The most severe damage was seen in Nepal’s capital, Kathmandu, where buildings collapsed, reportedly causing numerous injuries.

Shortly after the earthquake, the USGS raised the initial 7.5-magnitude of the quake to 7.9.

It occurred 33km east of Lamjung District and 80km northwest of Kathmandu, which has a population of about 1 million. The quake was at a depth of 31km.

Everyone is out in the streets of Kathmandu and people are rushing to hospitals, local media reported.

Reuters witness said a child has been killed in a town near Kathmandu when a statue fell in a park. A 15-year-old girl also reportedly died in India after the tremor brought a house wall down.

The historic Dharahara (Bhimsen) Tower, dating back to 1832, has reportedly collapsed in Kathmandu, said witnesses. The 62-meter-high monument was a part of Architecture of Kathmandu recognized by UNESCO.

According to witnesses at least one body was removed from the tower and a second lay further up the road. About 50 people are now being trapped inside the collapsed tower, Nepal media reported.

The quake caused an avalanche on Mount Everest, mountaineer Alex Gavan tweeted from Mount Pumori, about 8km (5 miles) west of Mount Everest, tweeted.

“Everest base camp huge earthquake then huge avalanche from [Mount] pumori. Running for life from my tent. Unhurt. Many many people up the mountain,” Gavan wrote.
