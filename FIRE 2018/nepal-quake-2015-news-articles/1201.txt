A ROCKHAMPTON family is safe after being caught up in the terrifying 7.9 magnitude earthquake which hit Nepal on Saturday.

As worried family and friends heard details of the earthquake, which has so far claimed almost 2000 lives, Michelle Jennings logged on to Facebook to let them know they were safe.

The Jennings family, which includes Michelle and her children Jesse, Paige and champion cyclist Taylah, have been in Nepal for three weeks and were due to arrive back on Tuesday.

They were in the capital Kathmandu when the earthquake hit and are now sheltering in a hotel with no power, but have access to a landline phone.

On Facebook Michelle described the earthquake as scary, but assured friends they were all right.

"Terrible around us," Michelle said. "Safe, but have to wait (it) out."

The airport is currently closed so they may have to cross the border into India if they can't get home soon.

Meanwhile, the CQ Health team which trekked to the Mt Everest base camp last week left the country only days before the earthquake.

The team was made up of staff members from the Central Queensland Hospital and Health service and three CQ teenagers who were trekking to raise awareness of healthy lifestyle habits.

CQHHS chief executive Len Richards said he's concerned about the Sherpas they met and befriended on their journey, two of whom live in Kathmandu.

"It really is quite tragic," he said. "It's a very crowded city, therefore you can image if buildings are crumbling, and I can well imagine they would, it will do a lot of damage."

The team spent a total of three nights in Kathmandu.

Former Morning Bulletin journalist Mike Scott is also in Nepal and said the quake lasted about a minute.
