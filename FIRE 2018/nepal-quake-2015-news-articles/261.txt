SINGAPORE - The Singapore Civil Defence Force is preparing to send a 55-man search-and-rescue contingent to Nepal in the wake of Saturday's earthquake. The police is also preparing to send a contingent of officers to help with disaster-relief efforts, including officers from its Gurkha Contingent.

The Government added that it is making a contribution of $100,000 to kick-start the Singapore Red Cross appeal for donations.

In a Facebook post on Sunday morning, Defence Minister Ng Eng Hen said the Singapore Armed Forces (SAF) C-130 will ferry the search-and-rescue team to Nepal.
