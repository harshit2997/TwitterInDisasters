The Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis on Sunday informed that there are 1,200 people from Maharashtra who are in Nepal and almost 400 have been contacted and returned to country. CM said, “ We have personally ensured 400 people have returned from Nepal. By late tonight we expect to bring back all those who are stranded. Our officials have been in touch and most of them spoken to have reassured they are safe.”

“Two flights have left in the afternoon. We are coordinating with ministry of external affairs in Delhi and doing everything to ensure their return as early as possible. The state has also facilitated free lodging and boarding for all tourists who are stranded in Nepal. And made provisions for ticket fare for those who would like to avail,” he added.

On Saturday, shortly after the reports of Nepal earthquake came to light, Fadnavis constituted a cell headed by deputy resident commissioner Samir Shah. In Maharashtra, Suhas Divse director of Maharashtra Disaster Management Cell was coordinating with the Centre and families who could not locate their kith and kin stranded in Nepal.

A team of 15 trekkers from the sales tax department were on the Annapurna expedition reached Kathmandu.

The second day the tremors shook Nepal, 18-year-old Srujan Bisi made another attempt to reach out to his family in Palpa district. “Yesterday (on Saturday), after repeated attempts I was able to talk to my family on phone. But after tremors today, their numbers are out of network,” a worried Bisi admitted. He shifted to Mumbai four months ago in search of a job and currently works as a helper in a studio in Andheri.

His parents, brother and sister-in-law all live in his native village where he said the tremors shook the house’s structure.

Another Nepal citizen, Raj Kumar, who has been living in Mumbai since five years said his entire family has not been reachable.

“I have been watching TV for news about Nepal. So many people have already died there and I am tensed about my family. But I think the tremors were not that strong in Palpa,” he said. Kumar has been working as a cook since three years.
