As Nepal struggles to cope with the devastation caused by the worst recorded earthquake in decades, Bhutan Prime Minister Tshering Tobgay left for Kathmandu on Monday to offer his condolences.

"On board special flight, bound for Kathmandu, to call on PM Koirala to offer condolences of HM and our people and assist in any way we can," he said in a tweet.

Tobgay also tweeted about the Bhutan nationals who have been evacuated from the disaster-torn Nepal. "Thank you Tashi Air for evacuating stranded Bhutanese from Kathmandu," he tweeted.

He added, "Druk Air scheduled to do two flights to Kathmandu to evacuate stranded Bhutanese. Proud of our airlines."
