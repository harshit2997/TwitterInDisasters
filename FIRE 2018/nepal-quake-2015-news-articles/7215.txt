Moved by the devastation caused by the magnitude 7.8 earthquake in Nepal, the Board of Trustees of the Handang Tumulong Foundation, Inc. (HTFI) unanimously voted to give monetary aid to Nepal.

A HTFI check of $2,000 was issued to the “Non Resident Nepalis National Coordination Council of USA” (NRN-NCC), a 501(C)3 organization based in New York.

This check, “a donation from the Filipino People to the people of Nepal” was handed over to Mr. Sal Lamsal, PE Sr., a Trustee of NRN-NCC at the 1st HTFI Dinner Gala on May 2, 2015 at the Renaissance Newark Hotel in Elizabeth, N.J.

Consul General Mario L. de Leon, Jr. was at hand to witness and assist in turning the donation check to Mr. Sal Lamsal.

HTFI will continue to receive online donations through PayPal or by mail to: HTFI, PO Box 2743, Fair Lawn, NJ 07410.

Please make check payable to “HTFI” specifying “Nepal” on the memo line for proper accounting.

HTFI extends great appreciation to all loyal donors, supporters and volunteers, and to those who attended the “Back to the Past to Prepare for the Future” 1st ever Luncheon Gala as they will announce their next fund-raiser; a 5K Run/1.5K Family Fun Walk on Saturday, Sept. 12, 2015 at the Liberty State Park, Jersey City, N.J.
