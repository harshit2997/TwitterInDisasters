As many as 35 persons from Belagavi district, who were on a company-sponsored tour to Nepal, are stated to be safe, bringing much relief to their family members here. The tour was organised by Shri Ganesh Agro Inputs in Fulbag Galli in Belagavi city.

The police headquarters and various police stations were trying to trace the members of the group, as their family members started inquiring about their safety after a massive earthquake rocked parts of Nepal on Saturday.

Chikkodi Deputy Superintendent of Police S.R. Patil and Police Sub Inspector Sangamesh Bidiginal told The Hindu that a group of 35 persons, all of whom are dealers or retailers of agro-products, had gone on tour to Nepal. The group included five persons from Chikkodi, one of whom called the Chikkodi police and confirmed that the entire 35- member group was safe and were nowhere near the areas affected by the earthquake, as they were returning and on the way to Varanasi in Uttar Pradesh.

When contacted, staff at the agency confirmed that a group of 35 dealers/retailers had been sent on tour to Nepal. A company supplying them Humisolve, a soil-activator chemical compound, had sponsored the tour in recognition of their impressive sales performance.

Similarly, groups of 35 persons each from a few other districts in Karnataka were also sponsored for the Nepal tour.
