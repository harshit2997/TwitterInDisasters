MANILA - The Asian Development Bank (ADB) said Monday it will provide a $3 million grant to Nepal to meet immediate humanitarian needs such as for tents, medical assistance, food and drinking water in earthquake-hit areas.

ADB President Takehiko Nakao said in a statement that the bank will provide up to $200 million in additional resources for projects in the first phase of rehabilitation.

Nepal was hit by a massive earthquake on Saturday that has killed more than 3,300 people and caused widespread property destruction.

"ADB stands together with the people of Nepal and the government at this challenging time," Nakao said in a letter of condolence to Nepal's Prime Minister Sushil Koirala.

An ADB statement said the bank has established a Nepal earthquake response team and will join U.N. agencies and other development partners to assess the damage and the long-term investment needs in Nepal for reconstruction and rehabilitation.

The ADB, based in Manila, has around $2 billion in ongoing projects in Nepal and provided $350 million in financial assistance to the country in 2014.
