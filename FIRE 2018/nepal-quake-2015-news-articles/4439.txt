BANGKOK, 29 April 2015 -The Royal Thai Air Force will be delivering the second round of necessities to help the quake survivors in Nepal and bringing Thais people back home.

According to Royal Thai Air Force Air Chief Marshal Monton Satchasukorn, an additional 11 tons of items necessary for survival will be flown to Nepal by two turbo props 8 C-130 H belonging to the Air Force.

The items to be delivered included those donated by Her Royal Highness Princess Ubolratana Rajakanya Sirivadhana Barnavadi and several government agencies. The aircraft were originally scheduled to leave Don Muang airbase earlier this morning, but were later rescheduled as the airport in Kathmandu was too crowded.

The two aircraft will take off as soon as they are given permission from the airport in Nepal. Thai nationals who wish to return to the Kingdom are advised to inform the Thai officials at the Thai embassy in Kathmandu. The Royal Thai Air Force will accommodate them with a flight back to Thailand.
