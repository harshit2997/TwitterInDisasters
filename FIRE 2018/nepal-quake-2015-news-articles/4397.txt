The bodies of two young doctors, A.S. Irshad from Kasaragod and Deepak Thomas of Kelakam in Kannur, who were killed in the Nepal earthquake, are likely to be brought to the Mangaluru airport on Wednesday night.

The 25-year-old physicians, who were selected for postgraduation courses, were on a picnic to Nepal to celebrate their academic achievements.

The post-mortem examination of their bodies was done at the Tribhuvan Medical Teaching College in Kathmandu on Wednesday morning, before they were flown to New Delhi later in the day.

The bodies would be taken to Kasaragod and Kannur from Mangaluru, the doctors’ relatives said.
