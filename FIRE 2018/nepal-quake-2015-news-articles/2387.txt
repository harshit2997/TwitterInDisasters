Nepal earthquake: Aid effort stepped up as death toll rises
</headline>

<text>
As the death toll from Nepal's devastating earthquake climbed past 4,000 earlier today, aid agencies continued working tirelessly to get food, shelter and medical supplies to those who are most in need.

Help poured in after Saturday's magnitude 7.8 quake , with countries large and small sending medical and rescue teams, aircraft and basic supplies.

US Secretary of State John Kerry pledged an additional $9 million in aid from America, as he sent his condolences to those affected by the disaster.

"The images that everybody has seen are gut wrenching, extraordinary devastation, young children carried away in ambulances, and villages, entire villages reduced to rubble , " he said.

"Families mourning loved ones and people still asking questions and wondering about the next day, let alone the next hours.

"We are working very closely with the government of Nepal to provide assistance and support."

Rescue workers and helpers from at least a dozen countries have already arrived in Nepal, including a specialist team from the UK.

Simon Thomasson, a member of UK humanitarian response organisation Serve On, said that he and his colleagues would go looking for casualties within buildings before calling in teams with specialist equipment to pull them out of the rubble.

Meanwhile, a team of Gurkha engineers will travel from RAF Brize Norton to Nepal to assist with the aid effort.

The British Government will also match the first Â£5 million of public donations to the Disasters Emergency Committee Earthquake Appeal, International Development Secretary Justine Greening said.

Along with military support, the UK is also sending more aid equipment to help search and rescue work after Saturday's devastating earthquake, including more than 1,100 shelter kits and over 1,700 solar lanterns.

The shelter kits include plastic sheeting, rope and rope tensioners, which will keep families sheltered from increasingly wet weather in Nepal.
