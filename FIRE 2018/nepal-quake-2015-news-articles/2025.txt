The death toll of the disastrous earthquake that shook Nepal on Saturday, April 25, at least 3 218 people have died.

Nepal’s disaster management centre has stated another 6,500 people have been injured, while dozens of people are also reported to have been killed in neighbouring China and India.

Thousands have spent a second night outside after the 7.8-magnitude quake, which also triggered massive avalanches on Mount Everest.

Many tent cities have sprung up in Nepal’s capital, Kathmandu, for those displaced or afraid to return to their homes as strong aftershocks continue, BBC reports.

The quake is said to have been the worst to hit Nepal for more than 80 years.
