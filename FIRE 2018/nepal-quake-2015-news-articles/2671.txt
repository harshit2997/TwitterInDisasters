The death toll has reached more than 4,000 people after the devastating 7.8 magnitude earthquake in Nepal and it's expected to keep rising.

A group in Fargo is looking to help as much as they can.

Anjan Neupane is from nepaland volunteers for the Fargo Red Cross.

He's working with the Nepalese Students Association at NDSU to raise as much money as they can to help even one or two families.

"Every family is missing someone. In every neighborhood, they are missing a house and in every community they are missing their neighbors," Neupane said.

If you would like to help, donation boxes will be set-up in each department on the NDSU campus where it will then be donated through the Red Cross.
