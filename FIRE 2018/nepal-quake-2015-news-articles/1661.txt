A Winnipeg mom is relieved her daughter in Nepal is safe after a deadly earthquake rocked the region Saturday, killing more than 4,000 people and wounding many others.

Joanne Johnson's daughter, Karilyn Johnson, was on a months-long trek through Nepal when the magnitude 7.8 earthquake hit early Saturday morning.

Karilyn sent her mom an email from a friend's satellite phone right after the earthquake to tell her she was alive. But Joanne never got the message.

Karilyn was was forced to hike for 12 hours straight to get to safety. A day after the first failed email attempt, Karilyn sent another email that successfully reached her mom.

"Of course I was relieved, we were all happy," said Joanne. "I knew ... there was still going to be some pretty hard things ahead for her. She's sick and I'm sure she's not sure what to do all the time, but you know, she'll ask questions. She'll be as safe as she can."

Karilyn's trip was supposed to go until August. It's been cut short and now she's flying home to Winnipeg, hoping to return to Nepal another time.

Winnipeg's Nepalese community is asking the public to help disaster relief efforts by dropping off donations at TD Canada Trust locations across the city.

Premier Greg Selinger announced Monday that the provincial government is donating $200,000 to assist humanitarian aid groups in Nepal.

"Manitobans join the rest of the global community in expressing our sorrow and condolences for the people of Nepal," Selinger said in a release. "There is an enormous amount of work that needs to be done to help bring relief to Nepal and we acknowledge our role in assisting wherever we can."
