Nepal’s Parliament on Thursday unanimously passed a resolution committing to work together in the reconstruction work in the aftermath of the earthquake that devastated central and eastern hilly parts of Nepal.

Political parties that have hardly agreed on anything approved the motion introduced by the government.

The earthquake on April 25 and another one the following day — of 7.9 and 6.7 magnitude — have claimed 7,765 lives and have left over 16,000 injured. The relief efforts of the government, supported by countries such as India, China, the United Kingdom and the United States, have attracted criticism for being “slow.” Local reports have come out with accounts of many affected villages yet to see any relief and rescue efforts.

Meanwhile, Nepal Rastra Bank, the regulatory authority, announced interest-free loans from the bank of up to NRs 25 lakh in the Kathmandu Valley and NRs 15 lakh for those outside the capital for house reconstruction. Issuing a statement, the central bank also said the commercial banks and financial institutions could take a maximum interest of 2 per cent under home loan for such purposes.

The Department of Food Technology and Quality Control said bread from India and noodles from Singapore were inedible, Setopati.com reported.

The department spokesperson Purna Chandra Wasti told the news portal that the bread was past the expiry date even before being sent from India. Similarly, 1000 kg of paratha (there was no brand name provided) had developed fungus. The entire pack was destroyed at the airport itself.

Spokesperson at the Indian embassy in Kathmandu, Abhay Kumar, told The Hindu that he could not comment on the basis of some published report and needed to know where and in whose possession these products were.

Forty-three cartons of Koka brand noodles from Singapore had also reached their expiry date and were destroyed.
