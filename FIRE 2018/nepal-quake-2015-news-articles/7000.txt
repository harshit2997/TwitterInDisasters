Longford climber blames 'political nonsense' for hindering Nepal aid

An Irish climber distributing aid in Nepal, is blaming political "nonsense" for leaving people cut off in remote areas.

Longford man Paul Devaney, from Irish Seven Summits, has been caught up in both of the big earthquakes that have hit the region, but stayed on to help distribute aid with the Nepal Ireland Society.

The race is on to provide shelter as the monsoon season approaches, and Paul says the Government should be doing more to accommodate the relief effort.

He said: "The aid simply is getting clogged up with issues on Customs, there is an issue with wanting to take help from some of their neighbours, the India/Nepal relationship isn't great.

"On the other side you have the Chinese, there suspicions about what they might want.

"All in all, it's a lot of political nonsense that is stopping a lot of very good organisations."
