LONDON: The UK has given 5 million pounds to help people affected by the devastating Nepal earthquake which has killed more than 3,200 people, the government said.

3 million pounds were released to address immediate needs and another 2 million pounds would be given to the Red Cross, the government said.

Prime Minister David Cameron tweeted that a UK search and rescue team was dispatched last night with RAF aircraft being sent today.

A number of Britons have been caught up in Saturday’s earthquake and the powerful aftershocks felt yesterday.At least 18 people have been killed in avalanches on Mount Everest.

Climbers and their guides have been cut off from Everest’s devastated base camp, unable to come down because climbing ropes and ladders have been swept away.

UK Foreign Secretary Philip Hammond said “we would expect there to be several hundred British nationals in Nepal” but there were currently no reports of any Britons killed or injured.

British embassy staff have helped over 200 British nationals who’ve presented at the embassy directly,” he said.

A British couple on their honeymoon are among a number of Britons caught up in the earthquake and subsequent avalanches in the Everest area.
