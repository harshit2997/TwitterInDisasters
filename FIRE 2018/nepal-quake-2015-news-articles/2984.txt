Editorial: Nepalese people need our help
</headline>

<text>
Scenes from the devastating earthquake in Nepal might cause feelings of helplessness as we witness the suffering and loss sustained by people on the other side of the world.

But we can help, and we should.

A magnitude-7.8 earthquake struck the South Asian country Saturday, its epicentre just outside the capital of Kathmandu, parts of which lie in ruins. The death toll is in the thousands and rising by the hour as rescuers sift through the rubble. Many more are injured and hundreds of thousands are homeless in a country already beset by poverty.

The Canadian government has dispatched members of the Disaster Assistance Response Team to Nepal and has pledged $5 million for water, shelter, hygiene supplies and security. Itâ€™s a welcome contribution, but much more is needed.

Some good-hearted people would undoubtedly like to fly off to Nepal to provide physical help. Others might want to collect blankets and other supplies to send to those in need. But such efforts, however well intended, tend to get in the way of rescue work. By far, the best way to help is to send money through accredited relief organizations. Money can be moved around the world instantly, and experts on the ground there can determine what is needed and where.

Be generous. Long after the aftershocks have subsided, the Nepalese people, so many of whom struggled just to meet daily needs, will need our help in obtaining food, water, shelter and medicine.

It could happen here, and we could be the ones needing help.
