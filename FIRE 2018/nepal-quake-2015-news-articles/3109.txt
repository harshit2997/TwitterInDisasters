India has evacuated 170 foreign nationals hailing from 15 countries from Nepal, which recently witnessed a devastating earthquake resulting in the death of over 4,000 people.

Ministry of External Affairs official spokesperson Vikas Swarup took to twitter to share the information.

"Friends in need. India assisted in evacn from Nepal of 170 nationals from 15 countries via commercial and IAF aircraft," he tweeted.

The people evacuated include 71 Spaniards, 33 Polish, 20 Czech, 10 US and eight German nationals.

There is an acute shortage of food, water, electricity and medicines in Nepal. Locals in Kathmandu and other adjoining areas are spending their nights out in the open over fears of another earthquake.

Hundreds of people are still trapped under tonnes of rubble in Kathmandu and some of the worst-affected remote mountainous areas in the quake-ravaged country.

India is doing everything possible to maximise the relief and minimise the tribulations faced by people of the neighbouring nation.

More than 700 disaster relief experts drawn from the National Disaster Response Force (NDRF) have been deployed by India, which has mounted massive relief operations as part of 'Operation Maitri'. Relief material weighing 8,200 kilograms were distributed by choppers and the Indian Air Force.

India has also sent a team of senior officials from the ministries of Home, Defence, External Affairs and National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA) to co-ordinate the rescue and relief operations. The team is monitoring the evacuation of stranded Indians in Nepal. Nearly 5,400 Indians have been brought back so far.

At least 4,352 bodies have been recovered so far from the debris in Nepal. The calamity, one of the worst in over 80 years in Nepal, was followed by 55 aftershocks.
