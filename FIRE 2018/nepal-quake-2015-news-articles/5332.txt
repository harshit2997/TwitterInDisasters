THE International Monetary Fund (IMF) said Thursday quake-stricken Nepal's economy will "decelerate" in the short term as the impoverished nation reels from plunging tourism revenue and higher imports following the deadly disaster.

The UN body said the country, with a per capita GDP of just $1000 per person, will suffer "substantial output losses" following the April 25 quake which devastated much of the capital Kathmandu and has killed more than 7600 people.

"Growth will decelerate in the short-term. Loss of tourism revenues and higher imports will strain the external position," said documents circulated at a media briefing in Singapore.

The IMF did not specify an updated GDP forecast following the disaster, Nepal's deadliest quake since 1934.
