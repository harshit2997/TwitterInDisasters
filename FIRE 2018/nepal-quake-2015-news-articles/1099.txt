Each kit has a basic and supplementary unit. The basic unit is intended for use by primary health care workers with limited training. It contains non-injectable drugs, medical supplies and some essential equipment, accompanied by simple treatment guidelines. Basic equipment also has a complete sterilization set and items to help provide for clean water at the health facility.
