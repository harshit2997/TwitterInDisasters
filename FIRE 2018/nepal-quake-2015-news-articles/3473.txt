International Aid solicits donations for Nepal earthquake victims
</headline>

<text>
SPRING LAKE, MI - International Aid, the Christian global relief ministry based in Spring Lake, is asking residents in West Michigan and beyond to help assist survivors of the recent 7.8-magnitude earthquake in Nepal.

The earthquake struck the landlocked, south Asian nation on Saturday, killing an estimated 4,400 people, according to the Associated Press.

The disaster led to a 6.6 aftershock, along with several thousand injuries, separated families, severe property and infrastructure damage and overflowing hospitals.

The United Nations said Tuesday that 8 million people have been affected, with about 1/4 of that number located in the 11 most devastated districts.

International Aid spokesman Tim Lopez said the organization will use donated funds to provide relief supplies to Nepal citizens. Supplies historically have included life-saving medicines, hygiene products, nutritional supplements and reconditioned medical equipment, he said.

"At this time we are asking the community to make monetary donations so that we can help out in the best way possible," Lopez said. "Every $1 you give to International Aid is multiplied to provide much-needed resources to the [victims]."

The nonprofit ministry in March sought local donations to assist Cyclone Pam survivors, while last year, the agency asked for donations to help Filipinos affected by Typhoon Haiyan.

Lopez said the International Aid is still responding to those nations. This week, the agency will be sending another shipment to The Philippines, he said.

"The needs in disaster situations are urgent and ongoing," Lopez said.

International Aid is just one of many groups offering help to Nepal. Catholic Relief Services, Save the Children, the American Red Cross, Friends Service Council Nepal and Unicef are among the other agencies providing assistance.

Residents can donate online by calling 1-800-251-2502, visiting www.internationalaid.org or by dropping off money at the International Aid office, 17011 Hickory St., Spring Lake, MI 49456.
