DENVER - In Barb Figg's social studies classroom at Mullen High School, she wants her students to learn more than what's available in a book.

"I am the type of teacher that I want my kids to experience," Figg said. "They can see history. They can see culture."

In March, Figg took 21 students from Mullen High School to Nepal on a mission trip for about two weeks.

"We were planning to travel to the mountains of Solukhumbu to build a dormitory for a girls' school," sophomore Cole Halax said.

Halax and his classmates also spent time in the city of Kathmandu. When Halax heard news about Saturday's devastating earthquake, he grew concerned. Halax made friends with a boy about his age.

"My first thought was to think if he was okay," Halax said.

Figg says the students made lots from friends in Nepal, especially with the families that hosted them.

"We saw the people of Kathmandu," Figg said. "They're struggling to survive as it is."

Halax says his friend, like many people in Nepal, are now homeless because of the earthquake.

"His family lost their home. Their apartment complex fell to the ground," Halax said.

The students also visited several historic temples and monasteries.

"They're breathtaking. They're centuries old," senior Allie Reynolds said.

Most of the sites they experienced just a few weeks ago are destroyed.

"We were just there. We just saw those places," senior Kathleen Storen said. "So, it's just devastating to see this part of our culture just destroyed. One day it's there and the next day it's gone."

Figg says the students' connections is compelling them to organize and help the earthquake victims.

"They went. They saw. They felt. They were a part of," Figg said. "So, to see them devastation now, they want to do something."

Her students trying to organize different fundraisers. They are putting together an impromptu bake sale this week at Mullen to kick things off. But, they hope that in the end, the students can generate thousands of dollars to help their new friends in Nepal.

"They need whatever we can give them," Reynolds said.
