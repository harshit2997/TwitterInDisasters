External Affairs Minister of India Sushma Swaraj on Thursday signed a condolence book at the Nepali Embassy in New Delhi and assured all possible help to Nepal in the aftermath of the devastating earthquake.

Swaraj said the government and people of India were deeply shocked and saddened by the tragic loss of lives and massive destruction of property caused by the April 25 earthquake.

“Several thousand people have died and many more have been injured across Nepal. Historic and world heritage sites like Hanuman Dhoka, Patan, Bhaktapur, Swayambhu and Dharahara have been devastated,” she said in the message.

The earthquake has caused a substantial loss of lives and property in India as well, which, in a tragic way, underscores that events in one country deeply affects the other, said Swaraj.

As close friends and neighbours sharing historic people-to-people ties with each other, India stands with Nepal in firm solidarity during this difficult time, she added.

“We continue to extend our fullest support towards the continuing relief efforts.

We are committed to assisting Nepal in the recovery

and rehabilitation phase,

in accordance with the requirements and priorities of the government of Nepal,” she said.

She was also impressed by the patience shown by the Nepali people during the quake. “I salute the spirit, courage, and resilience of the Nepalese people in the face of such adversity,” said the Indian minister. “I assure them that the government and the people of India stand shoulder-to-shoulder with them, and will fully support them in overcoming this adversity.”
