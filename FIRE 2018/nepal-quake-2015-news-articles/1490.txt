South Korea said Monday it would dispatch search and rescue staff and medical personnel to Nepal as relief assistance pours into the country, following a massive earthquake that has left thousands dead and others injured.An advance team of 10 members from the 119 rescue squad and four government officials were scheduled to fly to the South Asian nation late Monday evening to inspect the situation and help the ongoing rescue efforts for 10 days, alongside a Foreign Ministry official who departed earlier in the day.An additional 40-strong team comprising public and private rescue and medical workers will be sent shortly for a 10-day mission.The ministry, which pledged $1 million in aid Sunday, is considering donating an extra $1 million, a senior official said.“We would usually dispatch the advance team first and then the search and rescue staff, but we have decided to send part of them together this time because the situation is changing, in line with the ongoing aftershocks and adding to the already tough conditions, such as the small scale of our embassy and communication interruption,” the official told reporters on customary condition of anonymity.“While carrying out emergency rescue activities, we will make preparations for our upcoming full-fledged mission in tandem, adapting to the situation on the ground and looking into the range and type of activities of follow-up personnel.”The decision was made at an intra-agency meeting designed to discuss the scale, timeframe and other details of the public-private disaster response team. The meeting was led by Vice Foreign Minister Cho Tae-yul, with the public safety and security and health and welfare ministries also in attendance. Other organizations, including the Korea International Cooperation Agency, also participated.At least 3,200 people have died since Saturday’s magnitude 7.8 earthquake and aftershocks swept through the country, known as one of the world’s greatest trekking destinations along the Himalayas. Three South Koreans were injured in the earthquake.President Park Geun-hye offered condolences to the victims and bereaved families Monday.As the government looks into further aid packages, relief support is rushing in from various sectors. The Korean Red Cross on Monday launched a project to raise 10 billion won ($9.3 million) in public donations by June 30 and plans to send a search and rescue team and $250,000 in aid on Tuesday.By Shin Hyon-hee (heeshin@heraldcorp.com)
