KUSA - A man making a documentary about the Mount Everest base camp was among those killed when an avalanche hit Saturday.

Tom Taplin, 61, was a Denver-born filmmaker, Seattle-based camp doctor and a Google engineer. His brother, Britton Taplin confirmed his death to 9NEWS on Sunday.

Taplin was there with two other people working on a film about Everest climbers.

Nepal authorities said Sunday that at least 2,430 people in that country had died in Nepal alone, not including the 18 people that the Nepal Mountaineering Association says died in an earthquake-triggered avalanche on Mount Everest. Another 61 people died from the quake in India and a few in other neighboring countries.





With search and rescue efforts far from over, it was unclear how much the death toll would rise.

Colorado mountaineer Jon Kedrowski worked with a friend in the U.S. to update his social media and blog to give an account of the conditions at base camp.

In his blog, he shows photos of the destroyed base camp and describes the injuries of the survivors to be similar to those of tornado victims.

Fort Collins climber Jim Davidson was trapped at a higher camp, but made his way down to basecamp, according to his Facebook page. Davidson says fellow Fort Collins climber Alan Arnette is at camp two and trying to get down to camp one to be airlifted off the mountain.

Arnette left another voice update on his blog Sunday about the aftershocks and the new damage that has occurred: http://bit.ly/1IcQeRN.

Also on the mountain is Boulder high school student Matt Moniz. He is safe at base camp. Also reported safe is Charlie Mace.

Matt Moniz's dad, Mike Moniz, spoke to 9NEWS about the ordeal. You can watch an extended interview and see photos of their previous trips to Everest below:

Those still at base camp are working to rescue the people stranded near the higher camps and aid those injured.
