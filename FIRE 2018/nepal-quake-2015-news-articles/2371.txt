</headline>

<text>
A series of aftershocks rattled Kathmandu today as the death toll rose to 3,218, as residents continued to camp outside and survey the damage to the city.

Nepali police said 6, 538 people have been injured in the worst earthquake to hit the country in 81 years.

Hundreds of local and foreign passengers seeking shelter at the Tribhuvan International Airport in Kathmandu were seen helplessly stranded.

The quake was followed by continuous aftershocks and heavy rains throughout the night, forcing the airport to temporarily close down.

Canada sent a Disaster Assistance Response Team (DART) to Nepal and pledged $5 million in aid yesterday.

The disaster response assessment team is expected to be on ground in Nepal today to assess damage.

Meanwhile,China’s first medical team dispatched to earthquake-hit Nepal left Chengdu, southwest China’s Sichuan Province today to participate in medical aid in Nepal for 10 days.

According to the Ministry of Commerce, The Chinese government has pledged to provide $3.3 million in humanitarian aid to Nepal.

It has already sent a 62-strong China International Search and Rescue Team to carry out the humanitarian mission.

The death toll is likely to climb as rescue workers struggle to reach remote regions in the impoverished, mountainous country of 28 million people and as bodies still buried under rubble are recovered.
