Nongprue officials hit the streets to raise money for victims of the catastrophic Nepal earthquake.

Mayor Mai Chaiyanit joined sub-district officials April 29 at the Rong Petch Market on Soi Khao Talo to encourage people living in the surrounding communities to donate funds to victims of the earthquake, which had killed more than 6,200 people as of May 1.

Donation stations have set up in four locations: Rong Petch Market, Nongprue Market, Wanasin Farm Market and the Municipality Market. The donation points were manned by local governmental staffers.

Nongprue Mayor Mai Chaiyanit (center), along with Saengthong Kaenprathoop, member of the Nongprue Municipality council, and Lt. Pramot Tuptim, Deputy Municipality Permanent Secretary, meet with the public to encourage them to donate funds to help Nepal.

All funds received will be presented to the governor of Chonburi who will remit them to the central government in a united Thai effort to relieve the pain and suffering of the Nepali people.
