Southeast Missouri State University students from Nepal hosted a fundraising dinner on Thursday to help support the disaster-stricken nation.

The Nepalese Student Association served traditional food to dinner guests and provided information about their country before and after the earthquake.

The students say this is the least they can do.

"It was a very small idea when we all started it," Nibesh Amatya said. "We just wanted to do something for our nation because being here, we can't really volunteer, we can't really go back and we know that our parents, our people and our country, they need us so we just wanted to do a small fundraising."

According to Nikhil Khanal, an organizer of the event, the association sold around 250 tickets for the dinner.

Between this event and bakes sales the student association has raised more than $3,000.

The group is on pace to make nearly $4,000, which would be double their original goal.

All proceeds will be donated to International Medical Corps.

The students say they are blown away by the support they have received from the community.

"It's too exciting," Garima Bhattarai said. "We had not expected this many people but we are really glad they are helping us... Many people are injured an they're homeless. They are starving so we hope this contribution will help them.

There are approximately 75 international students from Nepal who attend Southeast Missouri State University.

According to the associations director Suzanne Omran, all of the Nepalese students at Southeast have been affected by this tragedy.

If you are looking to donate to the groups cause you can call the Nepalese Student Association at (573) 986-6751.
