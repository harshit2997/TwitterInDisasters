Crews Continue to Search For Missing U.S. Marines, Nepalese Soldiers After Earthquake

It’s been almost two days since a helicopter carrying six U.S. Marines and two Nepalese soldiers disappeared after a second earthquake in Nepal.

The crew was trying to deliver aid to victims rocked by another quake that happened less than a month ago.

So far, there’s been no sign of the helicopter, and no one has heard from the missing crew since Tuesday night when the pilot reported fuel problems.

Friends of Lieutenant Chris Norgren aren’t giving up hope yet.

Right now more than 300 U.S. troops are in the country giving support to victims.

Thousands of people were injured in the quake that struck Tuesday.

Rescuers continue to comb through rubble for survivors.
