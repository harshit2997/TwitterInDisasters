Efforts on to get Telugu people home

Hyderabad, April 26: After the state government set up a control room at AP Bhavan in New Delhi in view of the Nepal Earthquake, the AP Bhavan control room has assisted 33 references last night.



380 Telugus are reported to be stranded in Nepal following the earthquake. About 47 Telugu people (28 from Hyderabad and 19 from Vijayawada) have been brought to New Delhi last night in 3 IAF flights which rescued 400 Indians from Nepal.
