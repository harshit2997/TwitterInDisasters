ALOR SETAR: Three hundred and sixty eight more Malaysians have returned home from Nepal, following the first batch of returnees on Wednesday.

Foreign Affairs deputy minister Datuk Hamzah Zainuddin said the Ministry however could not provide the total number of Malaysians who were still stranded in the quake-hit Himalayan nation as many were not registered with the embassy there.

"At the moment, there are 11 Malaysians who are waiting at the consulate to be transported back home and we are expecting more to turn up in the next few days.

"At the same time, we would also like to urge anyone whose family members are in Nepal to come forward and inform us," Hamzah said.

He adds that checks showed that some 18,500 Malaysians visited the country every year.

Hamzah said the ministry was working closely with Malaysian National Security Council (MKN) to bring back Malaysians stranded in Nepal, after it was hit by a 7.9 magnitude earthquake on Saturday.

Commercial flights service would be utilised if the transporting mission involves a small number, he said adding that they would consider using government aircraft if it involves a large number.

Hamzah said this when met at the launching of Angkatan Koperasi Malaysia Berhad's (Angkasa's) International Reinforcing of Cooperative Seminar here.
