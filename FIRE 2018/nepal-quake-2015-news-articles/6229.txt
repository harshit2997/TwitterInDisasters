Just over two weeks after more than 8,000 people died when an earthquake struck the country of Nepal, another one overnight has killed at least 70 people and at least 1,500 are hurt.

Rescue crews are once again searching for survivors. A US Military helicopter carrying six Marines and two Nepalese Army soldiers went missing during a mission to deliver aid to victims. There's an even greater need for food and water now. Some of the relief is already on the way thanks to more than $50,000 raised in the Quad Cities.

"People are really coming forward," said Susmita Dahal with the Quad Cities Nepalese Society.

So far $31,000 has been spent.

"We have about a thousand blankets already in Katmandu and we have a thousand tents on its way," said Rad Pandit with the Quad Cities Nepalese Society.

"It's a time to help those people who are really devastated at this time. Totally terrorized our family, like can't even sleep. What if another earthquake comes? So, having to live a life that is not easy and it's going on for weeks and weeks," said Dahal.

On Wednesday, May 13, 2015 from 4:00-8:30 p.m. Scott County Community College is hosting a Nepal fundraiser to help provide aide to Nepal. A Nepali cultural show will be held at the Student Life Center of the Scott Community College Belmont Campus. Tickets will be sold at the door for $5 for the show and $15 for the show and a traditional Nepali dinner.

All proceeds will go to the Quad Cities Nepali Society.
