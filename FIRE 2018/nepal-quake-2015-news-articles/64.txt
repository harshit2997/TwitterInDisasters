The Nepalese Association of Connecticut met Saturday afternoon to talk about ways they are going to help victims in the state that are affected by the earthquake in Nepal.The earthquake may have happened thousands of miles away, but for Sam Khadka, the tragedy hits home."I'm very proud of the country where I grew up," said Khadka.Khadka left Nepal for a new life in West Hartford in 2003, but as president of the Nepalese Association, he's still in touch with his homeland."A lot of our members' families are affected. They are out there. We have to provide any kind of help to them," Khadka said.He is pitching in by organizing a fundraising drive. He believes people in Connecticut will step up and lend a hand to the people back in his home country."We have a duty to do something for Nepal and Nepalese people," Khadka said.

If anyone would like to help Khadka raise money, you can email nepaleseassociationofct@gmail.com.

You can also head to the UNICEF website to donate money to help the people of Nepal.
