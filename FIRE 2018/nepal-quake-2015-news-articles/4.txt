Ittefaq Report

The Bangladesh embassy in Nepal has opened a ‘help desk’ for its nationals after a massive earthquake reportedly killed many in the Himalayan nation.

Ambassador Mashfee Binte Shams said that the main tourist attractions in the capital Kathmandu, Thamel and Pokhara were the worst hit, but they were not getting “much information” about damage and casualties.

“We’re working and in close touch with local authorities. We have opened a help desk,” she said, urging all to contact the desk if necessary.

She said Bangladeshis mostly travel to Nepal as a tourist destination. “There are roughly 100 families (Bangladeshi) living here. But they all are safe”.

“So far, we don’t have information on casualties,” she said. The ambassador said anyone can contact in her own number +9779851039352.

First Secretary Khan Md Moinul Hossen can be contacted on +9779808184014, while First Secretary Shamima Choudhury can be contacted on +9779808765071 for any support, according to the foreign ministry.

Nepal’s Information Minister Minendra Rijal has already appealed for international help.

“We need support from the various international agencies which are more knowledgeable and equipped to handle the kind of emergency we face now,” he was quoted as saying by BBC.
