BENNINGTON >> The Catamount Rotary Club has begun collecting donations for Shelterbox, which will send much-needed humanitarian relief to earthquake-affected parts of Nepal.

Shelterbox begin as the millennium project of a Rotary club in Helston-Lizard, Cornwall, England, in 2000. Since then, it had become the largest Rotary-funded project in the world, sending thousands of boxes to families in disaster-stricken areas every year. The boxes, which weigh over 120 pounds when full, and typically contain items such as a tent, thermal blankets and sheets, water storage and purification equipment, solar lamps, cooking utensils, a toolkit, mosquito nets, and children's activities.

Catamount Rotary Club member Betsy Browning said the club decided Monday morning to donate $1,000, the cost of one box, to the foundation. The decision was made after learning that the Latika and Rajiv Jain Charitable Foundation would match the first $100,000 donated toward Shelterbox's fund for Nepal relief, starting on May 1. However, the group will continue to collect donations, with the hope of having Bennington sponsor several boxes. "We all remember Irene, and we remember how bad that was," said Browning.

Shelterbox relies on community volunteers and donations to operate. Its volunteers not only put together all of the boxes, but deliver them to areas that are often barely accessible. On the ground, they work with local organizations to get the supplies to where they are most needed. "What a great way to respond to an emergency," said Browning.

Those interested can make a tax deductible donation made out to Catamount Charities, P.O. Box 696, in Bennington. For more information, call Browning at 802-447-2229. For more information on Shelterbox, visit their website at shelterboxusa.org.
