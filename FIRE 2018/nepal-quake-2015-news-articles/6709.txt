Taiwan welcomes Nepal quake victims for medical treatment

Taipei, May 12 (CNA) As Nepal has expressed hope that it can send some of its earthquake victims to Taiwan for medical treatment, President Ma Ying-jeou said Tuesday that "we are considering receiving them."



Ma made the remarks while receiving a group of overseas Chinese community leaders from the United States at the Presidential Office.



Although Taiwanese government officials cannot visit the Himalayan country in the wake of two recent devastating quakes, "our NGO's and civic groups have offered all kinds of assistance," he told the visitors.



Taiwan and Nepal do not have diplomatic ties, but Taiwan's representative in India, Tien Chung-kuang, has stayed in Kathmandu since the magnitutude 7.8 earthquake hit April 25 to coordinate Taiwan's relief efforts. Tien arrived back in New Delhi Tuesday.



Ma said Taiwan is a peace-loving country that offers humanitarian aid to all countries and areas in need, one of the reasons, he said, why 142 countries around the globe give visa-free or landing visa privileges to Taiwanese nationals.



This is possible also because of improved ties between Taiwan and China, said Ma.
