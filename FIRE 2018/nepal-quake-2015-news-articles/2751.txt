TORONTO, ONTARIO, Apr 28, 2015 (Marketwired via COMTEX) -- The world is coming to grips with the devastating tragedy resulting from the earthquake that hit Nepal this past Saturday. With thousands of buildings in Kathmandu and surrounding areas destroyed, the United Nations has reported that the human tragedy is continuing to unfold in catastrophic ways.

The toll of the tragedy is unfathomable with over 5,000 people having lost their lives, and more than 9,000 others injured. Prime Minister Sushil Koirala of Nepal has warned that the number of dead could reach 10,000 people as access to remote areas increases. More than 8 million people have been affected by the massive earthquake, with more than 1.4 million people requiring immediate and sustained food aid.

"These numbers are heart-wrenching. We can only imagine the immense pain and suffering that the Nepalese people have been enduring these past several days," says Paul Meinema, the National President of UFCW Canada. "A mammoth support effort for the Nepalese people is needed right now. As such, UFCW Canada, and UFCW Canada Local Unions are supporting this urgent relief effort through a $25,000 donation to Oxfam Canada. We stand with Nepal and will do so in the difficult months ahead."

Along with the number of aid organizations, Oxfam Canada is on the ground in Nepal working to halt the suffering, and to provide clean water, sanitation and emergency food supplies to hundreds of thousands of people in Nepal.

To support the people of Nepal in their desperate time, UFCW Canada encourages staff, members, allies, and the public to be generous and support relief efforts. Your donation to Oxfam Canada through this link, www.oxfam.ca/ufcw, will be added to the amount donated by UFCW Canada.

UFCW Canada is Canada's leading and most progressive union. Together, we are more than a quarter of a million workers strong, and we are building a stronger future for UFCW Canada members, families and communities, while protecting and promoting workers' rights and social justice for all.
