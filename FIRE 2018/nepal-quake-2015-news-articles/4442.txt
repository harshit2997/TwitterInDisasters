Catholic churches under the Archdiocese of Manila will take up a special collection in Masses on Sunday to help the victims of the Nepal earthquake.

“There will be a second collection in Masses. We are now contacting a church in Nepal,” said Caritas Manila executive director Fr. Anton Pascual.

At the same time, Pascual asked for prayers for victims of the 7.9-magnitude earthquake that also struck parts of India.

Caritas Philippines has joined other agencies in launching an appeal for quake victims in Nepal.

Fr. Edu Gariguez, Caritas Philippines executive secretary, said a national fundraising campaign was launched on Tuesday for all the dioceses to help support Nepal.

As a member of the global Caritas network of humanitarian agencies, donations received by the local agency would be channeled toward Caritas’ response.

Last Saturday’s earthquake in Nepal was said to be the worst in 80 years, causing significant damage and loss of life with the death toll estimated at over 4,000 and still rising.

Caritas Internationalis, the international aid and development agency of the Catholic Church, said that aid was already reaching affected communities as they prioritize emergency shelter, trauma counseling, food and clean water.

Meanwhile, a seven-man team from the Metropolitan Manila Development Authority (MMDA) will be leaving for Nepal today to help in the rescue operations.

Equipped with rescue materials and equipment like life locators, digging tools, ropes and chainsaws, the team members will stay in Kathmandu for an unspecified number of days.

MMDA Chair Francis Tolentino said that the group was also deployed to Bohol and Negros Oriental provinces which were hit by quakes in 2013.

“This contingent will likewise conduct post-earthquake studies to aid Metro Manila in case an earthquake of similar magnitude occurs,” Tolentino added.

“This is our way of showing our gratitude to the global community for helping us Filipinos in the aftermath of Supertyphoon ‘Yolanda,’ particularly in Leyte and Eastern Samar,” he said. With Maricar B. Brizuela
