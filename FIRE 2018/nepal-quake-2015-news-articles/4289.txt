Nepal: Jesuit volunteers brings aid to quake survivors
</headline>

<text>
The number of people who died in last weekend's earthquake in Nepal has passed the 5,000 mark, with twice as many people injured. As of last night (Wednesday 29 April), 5,020 bodies were recovered from different parts of the country while the number of injured stands at 10,227. Through their institutions, Nepal Jesuits have reached out to many remote villages.

Relief materials (tents, mats, dry food and sanitation materials ) have been distributed to almost 500 families in Devpur - VDC in Kavre district, 40 kilometers east of Kathmandu.

A team of Jesuit fathers and volunteers have gone to Kaleshwor, a village in Lalitpur district, south of Kathmandu. Another team of Jesuits and volunteers have gone to Nuwakot district, north west of Kathmandu, to distribute relief materials there.

In the meantime, St Xavier's College students and alumni have organised themselves into different volunteer groups to help in the relief work. The College's Social Work students have identified Sindupalchowk district, one of the worst hit districts, as their work area. They are collaborating with Catholic Health Association of Inda (CHAI) in providing medical aid to the victims. The BA students have identified a place called Sankhu as their work area. The volunteers there are focusing more on providing health awareness to the affected villagers.

The BIM and BSc IT volunteers are helping out in the sanitation programme in a village called Pharping, 25 kilometers south of Kathmandu.
