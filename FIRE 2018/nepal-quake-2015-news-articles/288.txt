A C-17 Globemaster of the Indian Air Force (IAF) landed at the Palam airport here around midnight, bringing back 102 Indians from Kathmandu where they were stranded due to the devastating earthquake in the country just before noon.

"102 Indians including one baby brought back by the C-17 Globemaster III of IAF from Kathmandu to Palam, Delhi," a defence ministry spokesperson tweeted.

This was the second of the air force planes to return from Nepal with Indians. Earlier, a C-130J Super Hercules aircraft of the IAF carrying some 55 civilians landed in the capital around 11 p.m. on Saturday.

Over 1,500 people were killed and thousands were injured when a massive earthquake -- lasting about 20 frightening seconds -- and several strong aftershocks caused widespread destruction in Nepal. India too was affected.

In Nepal, buildings were flattened, roads cracked, telephone connectivity snapped and hospitals grappled with a large number of injured who were extricated from the rubble after the country was hit by the temblor at 11.41 a.m. India time.

The quake measured 7.9 on the Richter scale. The epicentre was Nepal's Lamjung district, some 75 km northwest of capital Kathmandu. Over 50 aftershocks were also felt.
