Travellers who are due to travel to Nepal imminently should contact their holiday company to make alternative arrangements, the Office advises.

“Customers booked on package trips with ABTA tour operators will be given three options; to defer their date of travel, transfer to another destination if available, or have a full refund. Customers who have booked independent arrangements who are unable to travel, should contact their insurance company to see if any resulting cancellation charges are covered, this may or may not be the case depending on the relevant insurance policy,” it said in a statement.

“Travellers currently in Nepal are advised to monitor local news and media reports and to follow any advice and instructions issued by the authorities and by the Foreign Office. ABTA is working closely with its Members and with the Foreign Office to ensure the safety of any customers and staff affected.”
