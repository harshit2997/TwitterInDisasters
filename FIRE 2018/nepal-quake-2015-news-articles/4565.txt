BHUBANESWAR: Tourism stakeholders apprehend the Saturday's catastrophic earthquake in the Himalayan country would take its toll on Nabakalebara in Puri.The state had been witnessing an increase in tourist flow from Nepal since 2012. Altogether 904 tourists from the tiny nation visited Odisha last year compared to 631 in 2013 and 326 in 2012, according to tourism department statistics."We expected an increase in tourist footfall from Nepal in view of Nabakalebara (formation of new idols of the deities) and subsequent Rath Yatra on July 18. Considering the poor economic condition in Nepal and recent natural disaster, we apprehend lesser participation of devotees from the Himalayan country during the mega festival," said Puri tourist officer Bijay Jena.A gloom tourism season stares Nepal Bhawan, a cheap accommodation centre for Nepalese, near the Jagannath Temple in Puri in the face. At present, around 12 Nepalese families are staying here. Their houses and family members are safe back home."I was worried about my family and house at Birat Nagar in Morang district of Nepal. I heaved a sigh of relief after establishing contact with my relatives on Monday," said Kishore Pokharel."Since long, my family has been rendering hospitality to pilgrims from Nepal. Last year, we received more than 700 people from the tiny nation. Hundreds of Nepalese had promised to visit Puri during Nabakalebara this year. They are unlikely to make it against the backdrop of the calamity," said Lalmoharia Madhab Mohapatra, a Jagannath Temple servitor.Jagannath Temple has close and traditional links with Nepal. The royal family of Nepal enjoys special privilege at the shrine. They are allowed to ascend the Ratna Vedi (the altar on which Jagannath, Balabhadra and Subhadra are placed) and offer prayer to the presiding deities. The temple premises are sanctified before their entry.The erstwhile Nepal royal family had been providing Kasturi (husk collected from a stag's navel), required for mukh shringar (facial) of the shrine deities. Since the fall of monarchy, Nepal's new rulers have not responded to the temple's request for regular supply of Kasturi, especially during Ratha Yatra.Temple sources said about five gram of kasturi powder is mixed with different herbs to make a paste before the same is applied on the face and body of the deities.
