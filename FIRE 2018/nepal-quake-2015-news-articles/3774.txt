Two teens from Seattle, Washington, 19 year old Bailey Meola and Sydney Schumacher, have been missing since April 25, 2015 in Nepal. According to the family, an anthropologist reported seeing the two on April 24, just one day before a 7.8 earthquake hit Nepal and aftershocks destroyed nearby villages. The two girls had been trekking the Langtang Valley trail; however, on Tuesday, the family received news that the girls are not in the village, Kyanjin Gumba, where it had been reported that there were no known survivors.

The death toll from the earthquake in Nepal has risen to more than 4,600 â€” and many more people are unaccounted for, including two teens from Seattle. The Meola and Schumacher families are staying optimistic that they will find their 19-year-old daughters, Bailey Meola and Sydney Schumacher. The two girls had been trekking the Langtang trail. On Tuesday, they got news that the girls are not in the village, Kyanjin Gumba, where there are known survivors. The teens had just graduated from Garfield High School and were taking an around-the-world trip, with a stop in Nepal.
