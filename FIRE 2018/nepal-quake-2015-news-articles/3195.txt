Crawley Down fireman flying out to Nepal disaster

<text>
CRAWLEY Down firefighter Adrian Kirkpatrick is among six members of West Sussex Fire and Rescue Service’s Technical Rescue Unit (TRU) who flew out to Nepal last night as part of the UK’s International Search and Rescue response to the earthquake disaster.

Following the 7.9 magnitude earthquake that struck Nepal on Saturday morning (25 April), which is reported to have killed more than 2,000 people and has left an unknown number still trapped, the Nepalese government has accepted an offer of assistance from the UK to support the search and rescue effort.

The six West Sussex firefighters, who have responsibility for the logistics operation, are part of a UK team of 67 responders including search and rescue crews, four search dogs, a medical support team and hazardous materials specialists. The team flew from Stansted Airport at 9.15pm last night and are scheduled to land in Nepal’s capital Kathmandu later today.

The team has taken more than 11 tons of equipment with them, including search cameras, listening devices, breaking and breaching tools, and jacking and lifting gear, all designed to locate and safely rescue trapped casualties.

The Technical Rescue Unit, which is based in Horley but whose members live across the county, is equipped to respond to disasters at home and abroad and has previously been deployed to earthquakes in Indonesia, Haiti, Japan and New Zealand.

The other five firefighters on this deployment are Matt Simmons (Wittering), Owen Marfany (Horsham), Antony Walker (Shoreham), Neil Graham (Shoreham) and Joe Sacco (Worthing).
