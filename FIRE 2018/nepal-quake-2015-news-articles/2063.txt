Four northeastern Louisiana residents in Nepal when Saturday's earthquake hit are believed to be trapped with a group near Liping and Kodari, but are OK for now.

Jan Quiet, Rudy and Susan Miksa of Monroe and M. Douglas Walton of Ruston are part of a group of traveling artists, 11 Americans and four Canadians along with three Nepalese who were visiting the area as part of "Journey Encounter Nepal and Tibet."

Walton is the trip's organizer. His Ruston assistant Marlen Waters said there are Americans from Colorado, Texas, Florida and Louisiana on the trip.

"I was able to speak to him noon on Saturday, about 10 hours after the earthquake, and they were fine," Waters said. "They had left Kathmandu and were on their way to Tibet, and the best I can tell, they were at the border and backed them up about five minutes from the border between Nepal and Tibet."

According to Waters, there has been an attempt to rescue them by helicopter, but poor visibility prevented the rescue.

"As far as I know, they've moved them to a flat area so they would be safe from rock slides," she said "They are all safe and OK. They just don't have food, water, or sanitation. It's just a matter of trying to extract them."

"We are working closely with the U.S. State Department and Sens. David Vitter, R-La., and Bill Cassidy, R-La., and a liaison to the families," Cole Avery, a spokesman for U.S. Rep. Ralph Abraham, R-Alto, said. "We do know the American embassy in Nepal is involved and a non-governmental rescue attempt has been conducted."

The last known contact with the group was after the earthquake and was a brief phone call from the Miksa family to their daughter Katie Beth, letting her know that the group was OK, but that further communication would be difficult.

"Susan is a fine artist and a seasoned traveler," family friend Georgiann Potts said. "Rudy is an engineer by training and is more than capable of creating solutions for unexpected problems. I have every confidence that they will do well in this unexpected adventure."

According to Vitter's office, other United States citizens in the group include: Jaye Catherine Clare, Colorado; Steven Leslie Kurtz, Florida; Janis Carolyn Kurtz, Florida; Jo Anne Long and Beverly Brooks, residence unknown at this time.

Waters said there is a Texas resident in the group. It is unclear if that resident is Brooks.
