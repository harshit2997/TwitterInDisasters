IMD Patna sources confirmed the tremor at 10.06am.Meanwhile, the earthquake toll was up to 58 and 180 persons were reported injured so far, said state disaster management department (SDMD) principal secretary Vyasji.The stranded Indians on Raxaul border were given food packets and sent to their respective destinations by trains and buses, SDMD sources said. Another control room (number 2522284) was opened with all updates. CM Nitish Kumar left for Raxaul by road. Minister Vijay Kumar Choudhary will camp at Raxaul for the next few days, SDMD sources added.The state government on Tuesday released Rs400 crore of the sanctioned amount of Rs1760 crore for farmers hit by squall and hailstorm. It has also formed a team of engineers in every district to inspect all highrise buildings and provide technical guidance to the builders. The engineers were also imparted training through videoconferencing by Prof A S Arya, former professor of IIT-Roorkee. He is considered an expert of structural engineering in the country.Vyasji also said, henceforth, on regular basis, all civil engineers of the state government, government and private architects and contractors would be trained in construction of quake-resistant buildings."Bihar falls in high seismic zone. Hence, there is a strong need to sensitize those related to building activity," he added.A 40-member team of doctors, who were sent to quake-hit Nepal by Bihar government, are stranded at Birganj and the Indian consulate general are yet to permit them to move further, said Vyasji. Even 35 buses which left for Kathmandu are also stranded at Narayangarh due to traffic jam.Meanwhile, a team of doctors has been deployed at the entry points on Indo-Nepal border like Bargania, Sonbarsa and Bhitta to attend to the people arriving from Nepal.Three more NDRF teams have also been sent to Nepal and three more are ready at Bihta airbase and are waiting for instructions.
