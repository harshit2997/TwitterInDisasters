Around Town: Nigh, nostalgia good match
</headline>

The audience filled the Petroleum Club to hear comments as George Patterson Nigh was presented with the Global Vision Award by Sister Cities Oklahoma City.

Of course they knew they’d re-hear some humorous stories about – and by – the former and best-loved governor of Oklahoma and others. But they all stayed for the entire program, which ran a bit late.

Theme of the event was “Connect Locally, Thrive Globally” and Nigh certainly represented that through his many trips around the world to countries that he invited to establish their businesses in Oklahoma.

The adoring audience was treated to an opening introduction by the Gangbusters Quartet, a barbershop group, singing It’s a Wonderful World, Hello Neighbor and, of course, Oklahoma!. In his speech, Nigh recalled that when he dealt with Rodgers & Hammerstein about having that song as our state song, he also was able to add the exclamation punctuation to the title.

John Reid, former press secretary to the governor, shared a few stories about his former boss and Richard L. Sias, community leader and good friend, introduced Nigh with many delightful stories as well as describing some of Nigh’s national and international accomplishments for our state.

Oklahoma City Mayor Mick Cornett presented the honoree with an exquisite sculpture inspired by the goal of Sister Cities Oklahoma City.

Vicki Clark Gourley, Sister Cities OKC president, welcomed the audience.

Presenting sponsor was Sias and table sponsors included the Meinders Foundation, Ann Simmons Alspaugh, Jeanean Naifeh, Clayton I. Bennett and the Children’s Hospital Foundation. Many members of Oklahoma’s Consular Corps were in attendance.

Congratulations, Gov. Nigh!

Helping Nepal

Horrifying is the only way to describe the devastation in Nepal, and it’s typical of our Oklahoma Standard that local organizations are actively involved in sending assistance.

A notice from Oklahoma City-based World Neighbors describes the devastation in rural Nepal, where WN has worked for the last 50 years, training those residents. They need support and plead for donations to www.wn.org to secure immediate needs such as food, clean water and shelter.

Word also comes from Oklahoma Contemporary and staff accountant Deepa Ghimire, who left Nepal at 18 to continue her education. She organized a relief drive for victims of the Nepal earthquake and now seeks help again. Tents, water purifiers, masks, blankets and financial donations can be taken to the State Fair location through Monday.
