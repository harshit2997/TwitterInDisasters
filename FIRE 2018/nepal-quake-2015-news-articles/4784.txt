Three Chinese military helicopters arrive in Kathmandu, Nepal for post-earthquake rescue missions on May 6, 2015. Chinaâ€™s ambassador to Nepal Wu Chuntai is leading a team to coordinate contact between Chinese rescuers and Nepalese officials. The occasion marks the first time that Chinese military helicopters have been used in the Nepalese capital after the deadly April 25 earthquake. The helicopters are mainly for transporting people and relief materials between Kathmandu and the border with China. (Photo: China News Service/Fu Yongkang)
