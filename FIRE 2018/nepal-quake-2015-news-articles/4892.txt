In the wake of the earthquake that struck Nepal on April 25, Apostrophe, an event management company, has taken an initiative to bring together artists to raise funds for the earthquake victims.

Bisharad Sharma, one of the members of the group, is also one among the affected by the calamity. Speaking with iamin, Rahul Abhishek, co-founder, Apostrophe said, “His family was affected and we could see him worried about his folks. He wanted to do something but he would not be able to do much, so we thought of organising a charity event. Nearly 15 artists are volunteering. The performances include Pune's Highway 61 (Alif) and Dj Abhishek Mantri as well."

The event titled ‘PrayforNepalQuake7.9’ is set to be held on Sunday, May 10 and will be hosted at Ishanya Mall, Yerwada. “Starting with brunch at 12.30 pm, the show would start with Chris and Mike playing. We will have bands performing till 8 pm and then the event will be taken over by DJs. The entry is free, there will be stalls with donation boxes to donate money, non-perishable food items, medicines and clothes," added AS Lazar, director, Pumproom, Ishanya Mall.

The funds raised would be given to the PM Relief Fund and the material collected will be directly sent to Nepal.
