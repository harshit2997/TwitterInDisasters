A couple from Cheadle had a narrow escape from the Nepal earthquake - leaving Kathmandu hours before it struck.

Naomi Everett and Tom Fairclough, both 24, had been due to stay in the town but left the night before the 7.8 magnitude quake hit on Saturday.

More than 4,000 people died in the city as buildings collapsed, with over 6,500 believed to be left injured.

Naomi’s mum Julie Fairclough and the couple’s other family members faced an anxious wait to find out if the pair were alive.

They had contacted the Foreign Office before finally hearing from the couple on Sunday night.

Naomi and Tom, who are on a two year trip travelling around the world, had decided to move on from Kathmandu just in time and escaped the quake.

They have been living and working in Australia and had also been to Everest base camp, where at least 17 climbers were killed by an avalanche.

Naomi’s mum Julie Fairclough declined to comment further but said she was relieved after hearing from her daughter on Sunday night.

Two others from Greater Manchester are still listed as missing following the disaster, George Richard Wilson, 69 and Martin Thomas Donnelly, 34, from Stockport.

According to the Red Cross, Mr Wilson was listed as living in Phortse, Nepal, at the time of the earthquake.

There has been no contact since April 20.

The charity’s website, which is listing the names of those feared missing, says a relative in Australia has posted his details.

Confusion on the ground however could mean details are not entirely accurate.

Mr Donnelly is believed to have been living in Sindulbachouk, Nepal, and there has been no contact for two weeks, according to the charity’s website.
