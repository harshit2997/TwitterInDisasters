</headline>

<text>
The death toll continued to rise after a violent 7.8-magnitude earthquake struck Nepal on Saturday, destroying ancient temples and triggering an avalanche on Mt. Everest, NBC News reported. A Nepalese police official said at least 1,910 people were killed in that country and about 4,700 people were injured, The Associated Press reported. At least 51 were killed in India, 17 in Tibet and two in Bangladesh, and two Chinese citizens died at the Nepal-China border, according to the AP. A senior trekking guide said 17 climbers and guides are believed to have died in an avalanche on Mount Everest triggered by the earthquake, the AP reported. It is believed to be the deadliest day in the mountain's history. Hospitals were overflowing with injured people, homes were damaged, phone lines were jammed and roads had gaping cracks running along them. Climbers on Mount Everest were sent running for their lives when the earthquake set off at least one avalanche. The epicenter of the earthquake was about 50 miles northwest of Kathmandu, according to the U.S. Geological Survey. Secretary of State John Kerry said he asked U.S. Ambassador to Nepal Peter Bodde to release an initial $1 million for humanitarian assistance.
