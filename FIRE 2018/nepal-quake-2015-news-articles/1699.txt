Swiss send Nepal emergency assessment team
</headline>

<text>
BERN, SWITZERLAND – A team of six specialists flew from Switzerland to Nepal Sunday morning in a Rega emergency plane, to assess precisely the most critical aid needs there, after the Swiss government offered to help the mountainous country as well as India. The huge earthquake (7.8) that struck near Kathmandu Saturday also left victims in India, China and Bangladesh.

Several strong aftershocks have created deadly avalanches in Nepal and, Reuters reports, the roads out of the capital city are jammed with people trying to flee to the plains.

The Swiss team consists of the Humanitarian Aid Unit‘s manager and assistant, a specialist medical doctor, building stability expert, water supplies specialist and a logistics expert. They are now assessing the situation to determine what teams and supplies Switzerland should send, based on how the situation there evolves.

The team is also working to help the Swiss Embassy and the overseas Cooperation Office that works in Nepal.
