Among those rescued from the aftermath of Saturday's devastating earthquake in Nepal were babies born to surrogate mothers and their Israeli families.

A small plane carrying premature babies — along with wounded people — landed in Israel early Monday, followed by another aircraft with five more infants and their Israeli families aboard, the Jerusalem Post reported.

Israel on Sunday said it planned to airlift 25 babies recently born to Indian surrogates in the Nepalese capital of Katmandu — whose parents are mostly same-sex couples — to the country, AFP reported.

Roy Youldous, from Tel Aviv-based surrogacy firm Tammuz, told the news agency that surrogate mothers working with the company gave birth to 15 of the babies, and four were premature. A further 80 Indian women working with the company are pregnant, he added.

Only heterosexual couples can legally have children through surrogate mothers under Israeli law, Youldous told AFP, leading gay couples and single people to seek the service abroad.

An Israeli bill that would allow gay couples and single people to have babies via surrogate mothers was approved last year in a step toward becoming law.

Commercial surrogacy is banned in most nations. In the United States, it is legal in some states and can cost more than $100,000, leading some prospective parents to seek services in countries including India, Russia and Ukraine, where it can be half the price.

Tammuz, which also has operations in the U.S., began work in Nepal in 2013. Neighboring India issued new rules banning foreign gay couples and single people from using surrogate mothers that year.

One firm, Fertility Tourism Nepal, says it has an IVF lab at the Grande International Hospital in Katmandu, and says it is the only center in the country to have helped create more than 50 babies.

On its website, the company says it has helped parents return to countries including the United States, South Africa, Canada, Israel and Australia with their babies.

Critics including Arthur Caplan, of New York University Langone Medical Center, have argued that paid surrogacy exploits vulnerable women, and there have been reports of women being trafficked into the industry in India, where there are said to be more than 3,000 fertility clinics.

In February, Thailand — previously a popular destination for fertility tourists — banned foreigners from using surrogates unless they have been married to a Thai national for at least three years.

It followed high-profile scandals when an Australian couple left a baby with Down syndrome and health problems in the country and took his healthy twin sister home, and another incident which saw a Japanese man reportedly father 16 children via surrogates in Thailand in what media dubbed the "baby factory" case.
