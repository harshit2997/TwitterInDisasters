Organizations Still Working to Aid Nepal

Nepal continues to struggle as it tries to recover from a devastating 7.8 magnitude earthquake that struck the country more than a

week ago.

In order to help, one local organization is helping with the reconstruction effort.

The Christian Aid Mission in Charlottesville assists 12 missionary ministries in Nepal. Two of the ministry leaders supported by the organization were visiting the United States when the quake hit the country.

Before heading back to Nepal, the leaders, who are husband and wife, spoke at a Christian aid forum discussing the current condition

of the country. Their talk left many speechless.

"I heard the news on the flight. It's so hard, I just want to get back to my people," explained Rita Chhetri, a ministry leader.

"There's a great need of food and water and a place to stay and people are just afraid to enter into their house because most of them collapse, some are damaged and cracked and people are traumatized," explained S.S. Chhetri, a Nepali pastor.

Thirty-four countries are currently providing medical, financial and humanitarian aid to Nepal.
