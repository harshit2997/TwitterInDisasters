Pakistan sends 'beef masala' packets to Hindu majority Nepal
</headline>

<text>
After the devastating earthquake in Nepal claimed over over 5000 lives and left a large part of the population homeless, a number of countries rushed to assist the nation with relief and rescue work. From medical assistance to food, each government has tried to contribute in their own way.

Pakistan’s aid included around 2,000 meals, ready-to-eat packs and bottled water. But this relief effort from Pakistan took an unpleasant turn after some of the food packets sent in reportedly contained beef, according to a report by The Daily Mail.

Nepal, being a predominantly Hindu country, has banned cow slaughter.

Indian doctors from the medical team sent to Nepal found the food packets that were labeled ‘beef masala’, continues the report.

Dr. Balwinder Singh was quoted by The Daily Mail saying, "When we reached the airport to collect the food items from Pakistan, we found packets of ready-to-eat meals, including packets of 'beef masala'. There were other food items too. We did not touch the Pakistani aid."

Another unnnamed doctor said that most people were not aware of the contents of the packets, according to the report.

This development has the potential to snowball into a religious controversy as Nepal was an officially Hindu state until recently.

Already, this issue has lead to outrage on social media.

If someone in Pakistan sent beef to Nepal in relief supplies, they are either insensitive or stupid. Perhaps both. — Vikram Chandra (@vikramchandra) April 30, 2015
