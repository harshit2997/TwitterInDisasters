Novocastrians off to Nepal to build a house

HELPING HAND: Novocastrians Melissa Histon-Browning and Belinda Smith building a house in Nepal with Habitat for Humanity.

HEARTBROKEN was the emotion felt by one Novocastrian after Nepal was hit by a 7.8-magnitude earthquake.

In the past 14 months, Melissa Histon-Browning of The Junction, has visited Nepal twice - as a photographer on a human trafficking documentary with 3 Angels Nepal and to build a home for a widowed women through Habitat for Humanity.

"I fell in love with the people, countryside and culture. I feel very sad," Mrs Histon-Browning said.

The April 25 quake has claimed more than 6000 lives and the Nepali government warns it could rise to more than 10,000 as rescue teams and the international community move out of the capital Kathmandu into the regions.

Some 130,000 homes have been destroyed, another 85,800 damaged and tens of thousands of families are living in the open, in damp and cold weather, scared to return their homes after the quake and its aftershocks.

Since the quake, Mrs Histon-Browning has been contacted by Habitat for Humanity. The widow and her home were OK.

Mrs Histon-Browning plans to return to Nepal in January to co-lead a Habitat for Humanity build with fellow Novocastrian Belinda Smith.

The pair want to take a team of up to 20 local people with them.

"The Nepali people need help and this is my way of giving back," Mrs Histon-Browning said.

She said the earthquake had increased her need to to support them.

Habitat for Humanity has been in Nepal for 18 years and has helped 40,000 families with housing and water sanitation.

Habitat for Humanity South Asia regional program manager Sophie Cooke said the trip would go ahead to help with the rebuilding process.

Ms Cooke said there was an appeal on the website.
