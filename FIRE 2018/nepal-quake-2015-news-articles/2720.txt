KATHMANDU, Nepal, April 28 (UPI) -- U.S. Army Special Forces soldiers, otherwise known as "Green Berets," are assisting relief efforts in Nepal after a massive earthquake killed thousands over the weekend, according to officials.

The two teams of some 26 Green Berets were already in Nepal on a training mission when the 7.9-magnitude earthquake occurred.

Pentagon spokesman Col. Steve Warren on Monday said the soldiers will help build tents for displaced locals in Kathmandu and provide assistance to the Nepalese Army in treating the wounded, according to Defense One.

The earthquake's death toll on Tuesday surpassed 4,000, while up to 7,000 people have been wounded.

One of the two special forces teams is specially trained for mountainous operations and is helping search efforts at several popular trekking routes, a military official told Defense One, including at Mount Everest, where up to 17 people -- including four Americans -- were killed in avalanches triggered by the earthquake. Up to 200 climbers are reported to have been rescued from the area so far.

Meanwhile, the U.S. Department of Defense announced the deployment of additional relief personnel on a U.S. Air Force C-17 Globemaster that departed from Dover Air Force Base on Sunday.

"The aircraft is transporting nearly 70 personnel, including a USAID Disaster Assistance Response Team, the Fairfax County Urban Search and Rescue team and several journalists, along with 45 square tons of cargo," Warren said in a Sunday statement.

The initial estimated cost for the relief operation is approximately $700,000. Officials said there were no additional requests for support.
