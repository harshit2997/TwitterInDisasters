MANILA, Philippines (UPDATED) – A team of Filipino diplomats are on their way to Nepal to assist Filipinos affected by the magnitude 7.8 quake that struck the country Saturday, April 25, the Department of Foreign Affairs (DFA) said.

"Our Embassy in New Delhi [India] is sending a team to Nepal to assist Filipinos affected by the earthquake in that country," Foreign Affairs Spokesman Charles Jose said in a text message to Rappler.

No Filipino citizen has reportedly been injured in the quake, according to the Filipino Committee in Kathmandu, Jose added.

As of December 2012, a total of 110 Filipinos are known to be in Nepal, based on data from the Commission for Filipinos Overseas (CFO). A total of 55 are permanent residents, while 55 are there for work. Most of them are skilled workers, professionals, and missionaries.

Jose also said that two Filipino mountaineers who came from the Mount Everest base camp have been accounted for.

Mountaineers Jessica Ann Nicole Ramirez and Jose Francisco Oracion were reportedly checked in at the Khwopa Guest House in Bhaktapur in Kathmandu, but were moved to Durbar Square for their safety, Jose said.

"[We] will try to get them to the airport and/or consulate," he added.

At least 14 people have been reported killed in an avalanche in Mount Everest, following the strong quake. Nationwide, at least 1,805 people were killed in the quake, which rocked the Himalayan nation midday Saturday.

Landslide debris and communication blackouts were the main problems facing rescuers and relief personnel as the nation scrambles to search for more survivors.

Adding to the danger are the strong aftershocks that continue to shake the area.

The 7.8 magnitude quake brought hundreds of buildings, including office blocks and a landmark nine-storey tower, crashing to the ground in the capital city Kathmandu.

Families grabbed whatever possessions they could muster and sought shelter on the streets, many of which had been split asunder.

Weather forecasters warned that rain was on the way, with dark clouds looming over Kathmandu that promised more misery for displaced survivors. – With reports from Agence France-Presse/ Rappler.com
