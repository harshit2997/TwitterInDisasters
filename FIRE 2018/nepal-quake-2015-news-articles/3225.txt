Students from Nepal who attend Southeast Missouri State University and Southern Illinois University Carbondale are hosting events to raise money for recovery efforts.

Southeast students will host Help for NEPAL, a fundraising dinner, on Thursday, April 30 to help support their homeland rocked by a 7.8 magnitude earthquake over the weekend.

The Nepalese Student Association will serve traditional Nepalese food to dinner guests, while providing a backdrop of information about their country before and after the disaster.

The dinner will be held from 6-8 p.m. at Centenary Church, 300 N. Ellis Street in Cape Girardeau.

You can buy tickets to the event at the International Center at Southeast Missouri State University or by contacting a member of the Nepalese Student Association. Tickets are $10 per person, with 100 percent of the proceeds going to benefit the earthquake victims of Nepal.

According to SIUC, more than 40 students from Nepal, along with some family members, live in the Carbondale area.

The Nepalese Students Society of Carbondale, a registered student organization on campus, is sponsoring an earthquake candlelight vigil and memorial at 7 p.m. on Thursday, April 30 at the fountain in front of Faner Hall. Everyone is welcome to attend.

The students have also begun an Earthquake Relief Fund to collect donations and support relief efforts.

NSS is also hosting tables at the Student Center and at Morris Library to collect donations.

A table will be in place from 10 a.m. to 7 p.m. each weekday, and possibly weekends, at the Student Center through next week, and from 10 a.m. to 2 p.m. Wednesday through Thursday, April 29-30, at the library.

In addition, they have created the Nepalese Students Society Earthquake Relief Fund at Old National Bank in Carbondale. The account number is 1282220963 and people can make donations directly into the account.

Organizers say all donations will go directly to the Red Cross, the Rotary Club, United Nations relief efforts or directly to hospitals providing treatment to the injured.

Remesh Neupane, a member of the NSS, said the organization will assure that all donations go directly toward non-profit organizations providing aid and toward relief and recovery efforts.
