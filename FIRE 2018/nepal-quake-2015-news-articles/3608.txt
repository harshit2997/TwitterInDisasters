BRATISLAVA, April 29 (Xinhua) -- Slovakia is to send humanitarian aid worth over 95,000 euros (104,630 U.S. dollars) to Nepal, which was hit by a devastating earthquake on April 25, according to government decision made on Wednesday.

The Slovak interior ministry has set aside up to 4.5 tonnes of material towards providing emergency accommodation and food for 100 people worth 62,963 euros from its reserves, while the health ministry will provide equipment for surgical suture to the tune of 30,000 euros. In addition, the State Material Reserves Administration (SSHR) has allocated 836 euros worth of blankets and water containers worth 1,487 euros.

Additionally, Slovak humanitarian organization MAGNA is to provide medical, psychological and social aid to those affected by the deadly earthquake, particularly for children. MAGNA director Denisa Augustinova said on Monday that the organization would send two four-member teams consisting of psychologists, social workers and therapists.

"We'll be providing aid at hospitals and provisional centers," said Augustinova, adding that at a later stage MAGNA would also set up specialized centers for children.

The latest figures from the Nepalese government revealed that more than 5,000 people have been killed, while more than 10,000 have been injured.
