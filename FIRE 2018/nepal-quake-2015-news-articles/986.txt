An Israeli relief organization, IsraAID, will send an emergency relief team to Nepal to help with relief efforts in the wake of the earthquake that has killed thousands of people and destroyed much of the country’s capital of Kathmandu.

On Saturday, a 7.9 magnitude earthquake devastated Nepal, mainly damaging its capital Kathmandu. The Kathmandu valley is known as one of the most earthquake vulnerable cities in the world due to it’s unstable buildings and poor infrastructure.The full extent of the damage is still unknown, but initial reports suggest massive damage, with the death toll rising exponentially within the first few hours. After the earthquake and multiple aftershocks, injured persons were rushed to Kathmandu's main Bir and Teaching hospitals, but local authorities are having great difficulty accommodating everyone. Tens of thousands of Nepalese are currently waiting for treatment.IsraAID will deploy its emergency relief team to provide food, water, and relief items, medical services, and psychosocial services to devastated communities within the Kathmandu Valley and outside. First responders will address immediate concerns such as basic supplies, shelter, and medical services for the injured, and immediate survival of those without access to food or clean water.Simultaneously, IsraAID will perform need assessments to focus efforts on long-term recovery for Nepal’s damaged agriculture, fishery, and water infrastructure. The Israeli team also hopes to assist Nepal’s mental health, psycho-social services and help with coping mechanisms in the wake of the tragedy.
