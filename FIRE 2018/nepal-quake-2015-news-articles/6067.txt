KENDRAPARA: As many as 15 people of Amrutamahani, Penthapala and Patarapur villages of the district, who were stranded in Nepal following the massive earthquake, returned to their villages on Thursday.

Urmila Sethi (24) is delighted after the arrival of her husband Bulu Sethi (28) of Amrutamahani under Pattamundai block. Bulu was working as a plumber in a construction company in Kathmandu.

“When the earthquake hit, I was in a three-storey building in Kathmandu. We rushed to a nearby field. Though the building developed major cracks, it did not collapse,” said Bulu.

Umesh Sethi (48), who also returned to his native Amrutamahani village, said, “We travelled for six hours in an auto-rickshaw from Kathamandu to reach the railway station at Birgujj near Indian border. Later, we boarded a train to Howrah and then came to Cuttack. Authorities of Indian Railway had arranged free food and tickets for us.”

Prasanta Samal (37) of Endalo village, who was working as a teacher in DAV School at Lalitapur in Nepal for the last 15 years, returned from the earthquake ravaged country with empty pockets. He said, “On the fateful day, I had gone to Indian embassy in Kathmandu to collect question papers for examination of National Institute of Open Schooling (NIOS) at our school. An old building of Indian embassy collapsed in front of me.”

Collector Debraj Senapati said 382 plumbers from the district were stranded in Nepal due to the earthquake.
