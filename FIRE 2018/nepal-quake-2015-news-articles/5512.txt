Prime Minister Sushil Koirala, CPN-UML Chairman KP Sharma Oli and UCPN (Maoist) Chairman Pushpa Kamal Dahal arrived at Langtang Valley on Wednesday, to take stock of the situation in the aftermath of the Great Earthquake.

An avalanche set off by the devestating earthquake on April 25 had wiped out the entire settlement of Langtang village, claiming lives of an estimated 300 people.

The leaders reached Langtang after assessing the situation at Dhunche of Rasuwa, from Nuwakot. Nepali Congress leader Arjun Narsingh KC had accompanied the leaders trio during their Nuwakot visit.

Prime Minister Koirala, after meeting the victims at Dhunche, urged the concerned officials to deliver the relief materials to every village. “No one should be excluded, keep that in mind,” said Koirala whose directions were supported by CPN-UML Chairman Oli and UCPN (M) Chairman Dahal.

Chief of Army Staff Gaurav Sumsher JB Rana, Nepal Police Chief Upendra Kanta Aryal and Armed Police Force Chief Kosh Raj Onta had accompanied the Prime Minister and the leaders in the visit.
