BENGALURU:Post the earthquake in Nepal, National Institute of Mental Health and Neuro Sciences (NIMHANS) is waiting for the Centre’s nod to send a team of experts for psychological and social rehabilitation of victims.

After a natural disaster of this magnitude, persons deeply affected by this can go into a condition called post-traumatic stress disorder. But with the help of experts, one can overcome this condition.

Talking to Express, P Satish Chandra, NIMHANS director, said, “There is a team trained to handle such situations. The doctors are trained in disaster management and can extend psychological support to rehabilitate the person in distress. Usually a team of three or four persons is sent during the acute stage to stay on for two weeks, after which another team of experts is sent for two weeks.”

He said teams were also sent to Uttarakhand and Kashmir after the natural disasters there.

Docs on Duty: Meanwhile, the Health Department has identified a 10-member team of doctors, who will leave Bengaluru for Nepal on Monday.

“Six doctors from the Health Department and four from the Indian Medical Association are to be sent. The department will send relief material (mainly emergency medicines) with the doctors. The team will leave for Delhi and from there go to Nepal,” H C Ramesh, state health director said. “From the state Health Department, two orthopaedic surgeons, one drugs and logistics person, two gynaecologists and one radiologist will be sent. And from IMA two gynaecologists and two orthopaedic surgeons will be sent,” Health Minister U T Khader, Health Minister said.
