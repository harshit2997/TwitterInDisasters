As more search and rescue teams arrive in Kathmandu today, local residents are also doing all they can to help find those who are still unaccounted for.

The entire city of Kathmandu seems to have moved outside. Families live on curbs. Trying to keep their children fed, clean, and most of all away from buildings. Where a nine story-tower had stood for over 150 years old. Now, just a stump. A temple compound.. reduced to a pile, where volunteers were digging with their hands. They don't expect to find survivors. Just bodies. Around 150 of them already found in this area. Many locals are joining the search.

This is the height of tourist season. An American visitor took this video of guests huddled in front of their hotel during Saturday's earthquake.

Kathmandu is on edge, awaiting after shocks that could last days, weeks, even months.
