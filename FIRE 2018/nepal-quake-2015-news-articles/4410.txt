— At almost 8,000 miles away, Nepal is about halfway around the world from Colby-Sawyer College, but the impact of the 7.8 magnitude earthquake is being felt by Nepalese students far from home.To 39 students, one faculty member and one alumni living on this campus, the villages of the diverse Nepal countryside and the city streets of Katmandu are home. They are safe in their second home, but their hearts are with their families, their neighbors and their people, many of whom are still living on the streets because they are afraid to go inside their homes.“There was just another one last night,” said Prithul Jung Karki, a Colby-Sawyer sophomore, referring to an aftershock that struck the capital city Tuesday. And the estimated four million Nepalese living on the streets since an earthquake struck their country on Saturday have been warned, and are worried about, more aftershocks.All of the Nepalese at Colby-Sawyer, which has one of the highest per-capita populations of students from Nepal in the country, have reached their relatives, and none have lost anyone close, according to several students who met with the New Hampshire Union Leader on Wednesday.And all of the Colby-Sawyer Nepalese are working on fundraisers to raise money for the those in need in their homeland, and are urging Granite Staters to get involved. They urge people to send money through a Facebook program set up to help victims of the earthquake, through Oxfam America or another trusted relief aid agency. They will also hold fundraisers at the First Baptist Church of New London and at the Episcopal Church of St. Andrews on Sunday.There is a need for food, medical supplies and clean water, and doctors and rescue workers are needed for the injured. A country already well-known for its poverty and its annual problems with stormy weather did not need such a devastating earthquake, they said.“And a dollar in America will feed a person for a day in Nepal,” said Jenisha Shrestha, a member of the class of 2014. “People really can make a difference.”Each day, with every news report they see, a sad feeling gnaws at their hearts. And the very heart of their culture, the historic and religious statues in Katmandu’s Basantapur Durbar Square, which Shrestha walked by every day growing up, were damaged or destroyed.“The statues meant a lot to people of different religions,” Shrestha said. “For me, it’s a big loss, I used to walk by them every day.”The loss of life — totalling up to 5,000 at last count and expected to grow — was devastating to the group.Shrestha and her countrymen are worried about their neighbors, some of whom have not been reported as found and safe.“It’s very densely populated there, I don’t think we’ll know whether some of our neighbors are lost for some time,” said Pawas Manandhar, a junior.And they still worry about their family members, who have been reported to them as “safe,” meaning they were not killed or injured. But some have learned their families are living on the streets out of fear of falling buildings.“There are people who are sleeping outside, and it’s been raining every night since the earthquake,” Shrestha said.Nishchal Banskota, a senior who, like most of the Colby-Sawyer Nepal students, will be returning to their devastated country in the next two weeks, thanked the college for showing such a strong supportive response. Campus officials held a vigil for the victims of the earthquake Saturday night, and campus and town residents have already donated more than $4,000 to the cause.Banskota said it’s been encouraging to see the support, but it’s been hard to watch from a distance. And it’s hard thinking about rebuilding what was lost, a task that could take as long as 12 years, by some estimates, he said.“We feel so helpless watching this,” he said. “The least we can do from here is try to raise money, we can’t do any more until we can get back home.”dseufert@newstote.com
