Nepal earthquake: Army rescue man buried under quake rubble
</headline>

A team of Turkish rescue workers pulled a man alive from the rubble of a destroyed building in Kathmandu on Monday.

The man had been buried in the debris since a deadly earthquake hit the region on Saturday.

The rescue happened in the Sitapayala area of the city.

The man's condition isn't known but he appeared to be conscious when he was extracted from the rubble.

The Turkish team that rescued him came from the GEA organisation (Turkish Search and Rescue team) and they arrived in the Nepalese capital on Sunday.

The man's rescue came as the death toll from Nepal's earthquake soared past 3,800.

Well over 1,000 of the victims were in Kathmandu.

How much higher the death toll may rise will depend largely on the condition of vulnerable mountain villages that rescue workers were still struggling to reach two days after the disaster.

Meanwhile helicopters have begin their attempts to rescue climbers trapped on Mount Everest following an avalanche that buried part of the base camp packed with foreign climbers preparing to make their summit attempts.

Climber Carsten Lillelund Pedersen filmed the moment the first helicopters arrived at base camp, where they are dropping off climbers who are trapped further up the mountain on Camps 1 and 2.

Filmmaker Michael Churton has described the moment he was hit by an avalanche while climbing Mount Everest.
