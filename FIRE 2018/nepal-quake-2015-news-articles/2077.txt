Faye Kennedy : Ottawa woman in Nepal not heard from after devastating earthquake
</headline>

<text>
Faye Kennedy’s family hasn’t heard from her in more than a week.

Kennedy, 32, hasn’t been heard from since Monday, several days before Saturday’s devastating earthquake. At the time of the quake, she’d been on a trek through Langtang National Park, an area that’s been affected by landslides after the 7.8 magnitude earthquake shook the country, killing more than 2,000 people.

Grace Kennedy, Faye’s sister, says they’ve reached out to the Department of Foreign Affairs as well as the Canadian embassy in Nepal, but they’ve gotten little information so far.

“I was told that they’re just registering names and they haven’t started the process to locate any Canadians,” she said.

They’ve been able to get limited information through trip advisors and sherpas that the group Faye is with is without electricity. She says Langtang Valley has been “completely flattened” by landslides.

“The roads that drive into Langtang are very precarious to begin with and very windy and close to the edge of the mountain,” she said. “They’ve been mentioning that the road has also been affected by landslides.”

Kennedy says she encourages Canadians to donate to relief efforts in Nepal, and is confident the Canadian government will do what it can to locate Faye and other Canadians in her situation and bring them to safety.

The Department of Foreign Affairs says an estimated 388 Canadians are currently in Nepal.
