Nepal earthquake: Australians to be airlifted out of Kathmandu, 15 tonnes of aid to be delivered

Updated

Australians stranded in Nepal in the wake of the magnitude-7.9 earthquake which killed more than 5,000 people are expected to be airlifted out in two huge RAAF transport jets later today.

There is growing anger in Kathmandu and surrounding areas, with quake survivors clashing with police as anger mounts over the lack of aid and the risk of disease.

The Federal Government said it had decided to airlift Australians out of Kathmandu because of deteriorating health and safety conditions and the limited availability of commercial flights.

Two RAAF C-17 Globemaster aircraft are due to land at Nepal's only international airport in Kathmandu later today.

The aircraft will bring Australian aid in and then take Australians to Bangkok.

About 80 Australians have been camping out in the grounds of the embassy since the earthquake, waiting for news on how they can leave the country.

Some say they will never return to Nepal after what they have experienced.

Some Australians have been unable to reach Kathmandu to be evacuated, with at least one group of trekkers stranded in the town of Lukla after walking there from Everest Base Camp.

The Globemasters, which left the Amberley air base yesterday, are carrying shelter kits and health supplies as well as nearly 15 tonnes of Australian aid and two medical evacuation teams.

Specialist Defence logistic staff have also been deployed to help Australians return home, along with additional ADF personnel to support embassy staff in Kathmandu.

It is understood the Kathmandu airport has been heavily congested, causing some difficulty for incoming flights, with only nine parking bays at the airport.

An official from Nepal's home ministry said the number of confirmed deaths from the earthquake had risen to 5,238 by Wednesday night.

Almost 10,350 were injured and more than 80 were also killed in India and Tibet.
