People in Nepal have been hit once again with an earthquake -- this one measuring 7.4 on the Richter scale.Josh Tomlinson, whose parents live in Decorah, experienced it firsthand -- and spoke with KWWL about it on Skype."I was in my friend's place on the third story for the earthquake this afternoon," said Tomlinson. "This time we were kind of on edge and kind of expecting it, so we did the right thing and we stood in the doorway and we patiently waited."Tomlinson says it felt like the quake lasted 30 to 40 seconds, but it was still very damaging for a community trying to recover from the last earthquake."Since the last earthquake we've been seeing a ton of damage, but I took my motorbike out since this afternoon and we saw fresh damage," he said. "New houses are down, everybody's in the streets right now, frightened."Tomlinson has been in Nepal for about five months, living in a district south of Kathmandu, doing HR work with the Umbrella Foundation -- an organization that works against corrupt orphanages and helps human-trafficking victims.In the last few weeks, he's turning his efforts towards earthquake recovery and he's turning towards the Internet."(We are) helping (with) medical expenses, we are building houses, we are paying rent until people heal," said Tomlinson.Tomlinson even made a Go Fund Me page, and has currently raised more than $11,000."Money goes so far," he said. "Just for $250, we've built three houses so far."If you would like to donate, click here: http://www.gofundme.com/nepalbrickchildren
