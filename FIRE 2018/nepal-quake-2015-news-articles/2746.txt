Missing 24 yr old Calgary woman in Nepal makes contact with her mother saying she's alive but trapped.

A Calgary woman missing in Nepal following a devastating earthquake over the weekend has made contact with her family.

24 year old Tamara McLeod was trekking in the Langtang Region when an avalanche struck on Saturday, and finally on Monday night, she managed to make contact with her mother.

McLeod is in Briddhim, a village right outside of Langtang and says she is safe with four other people but trapped and in need of immediate assistance.

McLeod’s sister Michelle Dack tells 660News, it was a short conversation.

“The phone call only lasted for one minute. She was telling my mom how much she loved her, she’s terrified and begging for help,” said Dack.

For more information, a Facebook group for all Canadians looking for loved ones has been set up here.
