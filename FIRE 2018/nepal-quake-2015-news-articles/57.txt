</headline>

<text>
Foreign Minister Murray McCully says New Zealand stands ready with financial and practical assistance as Nepal responds to the devastating ANZAC Day earthquake.

“Although it will take some days to learn the full extent of the tragedy, the casualty toll in dead and injured and the damage to Nepal's infrastructure and economy are clearly massive," Mr McCully says.

“New Zealand is considering options and is keen to provide help as soon as the Nepali authorities indicate what would be most useful in the context of the wider international response.

"Staff at the New Zealand High Commission in New Delhi and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Wellington are continuing efforts to account for all New Zealanders in Nepal at the time of the earthquake.

“We have confirmed the well-being of more than 100 New Zealanders and we will work with international partners on the relief effort.

“New Zealand expresses its deepest condolences to the people of Nepal. We know from recent experience the suffering an earthquake of this magnitude can bring," Mr McCully says.

Consular information: Communications are hugely disrupted in the affected areas. New Zealanders in Nepal, are advised to follow the advice of local authorities and monitor local media for updates and keep friends and family in New Zealand informed of their well-being as soon as they are able.

New Zealanders with concerns for family in Nepal are advised to try contacting them directly in the first instance.

As communications infrastructure has been damaged, we recommend trying short text messages. If there are ongoing concerns, please contact the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade on 04 439 8000.
