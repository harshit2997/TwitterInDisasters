Blenheim extends helping hand to Nepal

SCOTT HAMMOND/FAIRFAX NZ Villa Maria viticulturist Stuart Dudley has donated his services for a fundraising auction this Thursday.

A sailing trip, a wardrobe makeover and the help of a horse whisperer are among the services and experiences that will be auctioned off at a fundraiser for Nepal in Blenheim on Thursday.

Marlborough people have donated their time, skills and tools for the Hands Up For Nepal event at the Blenheim Club.

The fundraiser will support the people of Nepal after a magnitude 7.8 earthquake in April killed more than 7900 people and injured more than 17,000.

Viticulturist Stuart Dudley, who is helping to organise the event, said the support for the fundraiser had been amazing.

"Everyone has been so generous - so many people have said they'll donate time and goods to the cause

"With the recent little earthquakes we've had here and the big quakes we've had in Christchurch, New Zealanders can relate to needing a helping hand."

The fundraiser was a way for Marlburians to help out, Dudley said.

"I think the devastation in Nepal is very obvious for people to see but it's quite hard being this far away to do anything about it.

"The money we raise here can do a lot of good over there."

Dudley had volunteered to provide viticulture advice as his contribution to the silent auction. He was also happy to take a group for a vineyard tour and picnic.

Horse trainer Paddy Redwood offered to train a young horse for two weeks or break in a horse, while Aaron Blackmore, of Oddies Marine, said he would take a group of up to six people sailing in the Marlborough Sounds.

Image consultant and wardrobe stylist Aoife O'Shaughnessy was offering a one-on-one style consultation and Terra Vitae Vineyards donated a day of vine stripping in the Awatere Valley.

Most of the items would be bid on through a silent auction, although some of the more valuable services would be distributed through a normal auction on the night.

Money raised at the event would be donated to the Sir Edmund Hillary Himalayan Trust.

Nelson man John McKinnon, who worked as a doctor at a Nepalese hospital set up by the trust in the 1960s, would talk at the event about the work the organisation did in Nepal.

* Hands Up For Nepal, 6pm - 8pm, May 14, The Blenheim Club, 92 High St, Blenheim. $10 donation at the door.
