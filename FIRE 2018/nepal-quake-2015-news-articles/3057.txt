STUDENTS planning to volunteer in regional Nepal are more motivated than ever to make a positive difference in the wake of a devastating earthquake that has killed thousands in the areas where they are heading.



The team of 15 year 12 students from James Sheahan, Kinross Wolaroi and Orange High schools signed up to take part in the Rotary Club of Orange Daybreak’s inaugural Alternative Schoolies program last year; with plans for Rotarians Mary Brell and Michelle Duncan to lead them through the Pokhara, Ghandruk and Chitwan regions in November.

But with their tour leader Ms Brell trapped but unharmed in the Nepalese capital Kathmandu, temples they were to take in destroyed, trekking areas wiped out and the isolated communities they were to help severely rattled; Kinross Wolaroi student Georga Nonnenmacher said the group was in disarray.

“It really hits close to home,” she said.

While the team members gather to work out a plan and re-schedule together, Georga says she is already planning to extend her stay and include more humanitarian work in her tour agenda and is sure others will be keen to re-evaluate what they’re doing.

“Half of the population are children and over one million need assistance. There will still be a big need for help and relief come November,” she said.

Having starting to fundraise for their campaign in March within their school communities and at the monthly Orange Region Farmers Market, Georga said they now wanted to reach further into the community to raise more money for affected communities.

The team of students heading to Nepal is Andie Delaney, Kandii Fuller, Lizzie Bilton, Chloe Smith, Bronie Condon, Ben Dyet, Fleur Connick, Julia Bates-Gussoni, Mia Hull, Georga Nonnenmacher, Jake Follent, Elise Jones, Maddy Dowd, Billy Thompson and Maddie Lisle.

Those willing to offer help to the students’ appeal can contact the Rotary Club of Orange Daybreak through their website www.rotaryorangeday break.org.au.
