Whale-watching for Nepal
</headline>

<text>
Icelandic whale-watching company Whale Safari is organising special ‘adventure tours’ this Saturday, the proceeds of which will be donated to the rescue and relief programme for victims of the Nepal earthquake.

In cooperation with Friends of Nepal, Whale Safari will be running special whale-watching tours in Faxaflói Bay (off Reykjavik), departing from Reykjavik Harbour every hour on the hour from 9am to 4pm this Saturday.

There will be a minimum charge of ISK 5,000 (approx. €35), with customers able to decide how much they want to pay – with no upper limit, of course! All proceeds from the initiative will go directly to the rescue and relief programme for victims of the Nepal earthquake.

Booking should be made via e-mail to nepal@whalesafari.is, and customers are asked to specify their desired time and number of passengers. Payment can be made by bank transfer or upon departure.
