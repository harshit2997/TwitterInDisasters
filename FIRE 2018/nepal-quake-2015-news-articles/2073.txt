CALGARY –The family of a Calgary yoga teacher stranded in Nepal following a devastating 7.8 magnitude earthquake has finally received word that she is safe.

Tamara McLeod, 24, was in the Langtang region in Nepal when the earthquake hit.

Her family says they received a message from McLeod several hours after the quake, saying that she felt the tremor but that she was okay.

The next day, an avalanche triggered by the quake engulfed Langtang.

Monday evening – crying and desperate for help – McLeod got in touch again. She told her loved ones she is stranded with three other people. Six of their companions had gone to find help.

Her sister, Michelle Dack, says helicopters have been slow to reach the area. However, crews have been able to rescue some survivors.

McLeod arrived in Nepal at the beginning of April to teach a yoga workshop.

Her family says that now that they know she is safe, they are contacting officials with Foreign Affairs in the hopes that Canada will help get her out of harm’s way.
