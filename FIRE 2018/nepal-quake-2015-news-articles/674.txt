New Zealand Red Cross has launched an appeal to support the needs of people affected by the massive 7.8 earthquake in Nepal and is working to restore contact between people separated by the disaster.

Tony Paine Secretary General of New Zealand Red Cross says the humanitarian need following the earthquake is going to be huge.

"The Nepal Red Cross has already mobilized emergency response teams who are tirelessly looking for survivors. We have launched an emergency appeal here in New Zealand to help support their immediate relief efforts and we will also work with them in the long term to help people recover."

Nepal Red Cross teams are supporting search-and-rescue efforts and providing first aid after a massive earthquake collapsed buildings across the capital. The International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies, of which New Zealand Red Cross is a part, is preparing to mount an international emergency response.

Mr Paine says New Zealand’s friendship with Nepal goes back a long way and that Kiwi’s will be standing by them through this difficult time.

"Through history we have strong links with Nepal. We also we know first-hand the devastating impact of earthquakes, both in the short and long term. Once the full extent of the impact of the earthquake has been assessed we will be working to determine how we can further assist."

If New Zealanders are looking for missing loved ones in Nepal, please register their names on this website: http://familylinks.icrc.org/nepal-earthquake/en/Pages/Home.aspx If people do make contact with affected loved ones, please register as 'safe and well' on the site to prevent others being left wondering. These services are confidential and free to all.
