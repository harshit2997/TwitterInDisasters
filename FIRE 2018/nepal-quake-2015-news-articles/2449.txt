Nepal grapples with access to basic necessities
</headline>

<text>
With the devastating earthquake crippling Nepal's infrastructure, the country has been pushed to the brink due to scarcity of essential items like drinking water, food and fuel, hitting people the most.



To make the matters worse, several parts of the capital are still without electricity since the 7.9-magnitude quake struck on Saturday noon that has impacted the communication system, including mobile phone services.



The worst-affected areas are interior regions, which are difficult to reach, especially after roads were severely damaged following the temblor.Several shops in the capital city - parts of which still wear a deserted look - have remained shut, causing hardships to people in terms of accessing basic food items like milk.Waiwai - precooked noodles popular in Nepal and Bhutan, chips and biscuits have been the source of food to many.Long serpentine queues could be seen outside petrol pumps across Kathmandu as the Himalayan nation depends on oil imports."The police and military authorities have been manning the petrol pumps to avoid chaos," said a taxi driver."There has been no supply of milk for the past three days. There is also no electricity in some parts. Elders can manage, but what about children and elderly people?!" said Dekh Bahadur, who resides near the Tribhuvan International Airport."Good drinking water is also a major issue. Nepal police and army have been providing us with water, but even that is very little for so many people," he added.
