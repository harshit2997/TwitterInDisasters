(ANSA) - Rome, April 28 - Italy is to deploy teams of experts to help Nepal salvage its rich cultural heritage after Saturday's devastating earthquake in which at least 5,057 people died, cultural authorities said Tuesday.

"The first few hours are fundamental for salvage operations," Culture Ministry Secretary-General Antonella Pasqua Recchia said, adding that a first group of experts is ready to depart.

"Italy has essential skills in the field of post-quake artistic heritage intervention, which have been honed through recent experiences of earthquakes here," Pasqua Recchia continued. "The first few days are fundamental," she insisted.

"It is necessary to organise and think correctly, intervene in the first place with respect to the materials that have collapsed, salvage everything, carry out inventories, in such a way that nothing is lost," Recchia continued.

An initial reconnaissance mission could be followed by interventions aimed at shoring up collapsed structures and artworks before proceeding with recovery and restoration.

Italy has done this before in in the aftermath of the massive 2003 earthquake in the Iranian city of Bam.

"It won't be easy, because the type of construction in these countries is sometimes very delicate and fragile - some walls have crumbled and been almost reduced to dust," Pasqua Recchia explained. "However, it is essential to be able to use the original construction materials in rebuilding a monument, as this and not just its formal appearance is what makes the work unique." Saturday's 7.8-magnitude earthquake dealt a devastating blow to Nepal's cultural heritage, reducing many temples and other historic buildings in the Durbar squares (noble courts) of Kathmandu, Patan and Bhaktapur - part of the UNESCO World Heritage Site in the Kathmandu Valley - to piles of rubble. The landmark early 19th-century Dharahara tower in Kathmandu also collapsed, while the 5th-century Buddhist temple complex at Swayambhunath sustained some damage.
