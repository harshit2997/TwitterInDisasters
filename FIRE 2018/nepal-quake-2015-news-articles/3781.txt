THE last Perth resident missing in Nepal after a massive earthquake struck on Saturday has been accounted for.

Mitchell Noga, 21, from Victoria Park has made contact with his family.

His mother Sheryl Noga told PerthNow that he had been in touch and was in Thorong-La Pass Annapurna.

Mrs Noga said the Red Cross had now been notified that her son was safe.

Mr Noga’s contact comes after three Fremantle teenagers also made contact with worried parents on Tuesday.

Jalada Wilson, 18, from Hilton and Fremantle teens Raoul Poncin, 19, and Rin Hutcheson, 18, were last known to be in Langtang, a hiking area near Kathmandu when the quake struck on Saturday.

On Tuesday night, they made contact with their families, with Raoul’s dad Freddy Poncin posting on Facebook: “GREAT NEWS — GREAT NEWS. Raoul Poncin Jalada Wilson and Rin Hutcheson are safe but cant get out of the Langtang area. They are in a place called Syabrubesi and all roads are blocked. Soon they will be picked up!!

“A very happy dad here!!! Thanks to all for your support!!!! Peace, Freddy Poncin”

Jalada’s father, Ian Wilson, also confirmed the boys were currently stuck in Syahbrubesi.

“The boys are safe, they are stuck in Syahbrubesi due to road damage but are otherwise okay. We are very relieved,” Mr Wilson said.

“Rin’s dad took a brief call from him, just enough to say they are okay but need to wait for a helicopter out. We are trying to arrange one from Kathmandu.”

Jalada’s mother Ida Hamida had flown to Nepal to help try and track down the trio and provide another point of contact for the boys’ families in WA.
