Rapid City Regional Hospital physician headed to Nepal to assist in relief effort
</headline>

<text>
At least 12 people working at Rapid City Regional Hospital come from Nepal and at least one of them has made the choice to go back to his homeland, just two days after a massive earthquake hit the small Asian country.

More than 4,000 people have been killed so far and more than 7,000 others have been injured.

Now the rescue, recovery and relief efforts have begun, with one of those Rapid City Regional Hospital physicians joining in on the work.

Dr. Binod Dhungana, who is originally from Nepal, will leave on Sunday to provide patient care to victims of the disaster.

He says he plans to stay until the end of May and will provide the best care in the best possible way.

Dhungana says, "This is my workplace, I need to contribute as much as I can when I'm working here. But that's my home place, and I have been involved in many social activities before, and now when people in the country are suffering and me being a doctor, if I don't go and help in this difficult time, then there's no objective of my life, you know. It's a call."

Dr. Dhungana says his family is in Nepal, which is another reason why he is going to help and says he hopes they are all safe.

He encourages others to help as well by donating to www.americanepalmedicalfoundation.com.
