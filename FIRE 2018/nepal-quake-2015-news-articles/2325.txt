CHARLOTTE, N.C. -- The last 24 hours brought frustration for Nepalese in the U.S. trying to reach loved ones in Nepal.

"Not knowing if they are alive, dead, not knowing the structure around their house...that's crazy," said Saujanya Aryal, who lives in Charlotte.

The magnitude 7.8 quake leveled buildings, split open the earth and created terror throughout the country and the aftershocks continue.

"People are feeling the tremble so it's difficult to go inside the house not knowing if the building might collapse you don't want to risk your life," said Sussil Nepal, who lives in Charlotte.

Aryal and Nepal both live and work in Charlotte and came to the states more than 10 years ago from Nepal. The two are coordinating relief efforts through the Greater Charlotte Nepalese Association.

"We're trying to funnel donations through one link so it doesn't go to fraud or anything and trying to find tax exempt organizations so all the amount goes to relief," said Nepal.

Samaritan's Purse has a crew of 22 in route to Nepal. Christ Toews, Director of International Projects, shares reports he's received from the ground.

"Utter devastation, buildings have crumbled completely. Just dust, then you have people milling about of former structures whether they were homes or former establishments wondering if friends and family members are still stuck," said Toews.

Communication lines between the capital city Kathmandu and other towns have been mostly wiped out making it difficult to know how the rest of the country fared. Medical facilities continue to take in as many as they can.

"They are so full to capacity they don't have enough rooms to help them," said Aryal.

Wednesday Charlotte Nepalese will hold a vigil for those lost in the quake. That will happen at the International House on Central Avenue from 6:30 to 8 p.m.
