FIREFIGHTERS from Hampshire are part of a search and rescue team which has been sent to help with the aftermath of an earthquake in Nepal which has killed more than 3,000 people.

The Department for International Development has deployed a team of more than 60 search and rescue responders and medical experts as part of a cross-party Government attempt to support the relief effort in Nepal following a 7.8-magnitude earthquake on Saturday.

Officials have said that at least 3,326 people are known to have died in the massive earthquake but that figure is expected to rise.

And as part of the UK International Search and Rescue team, 10 firefighters from Hampshire Fire and Rescue Service have been sent to the country to help with relief efforts.

A flight carrying seven UK International Search and Rescue crews, four search and rescue dogs, a medical support team and a hazardous materials specialist left London for the country’s capital Kathmandu, yesterday evening.

In addition to the teams, 11 tonnes of kit including torches, axes, ropes, search cameras, stretchers and tents were also on board the aircraft, as well as a Foreign Office Rapid Deployment Team who will provide consular assistance for British nationals affected by the disaster.

Justine Greening, Secretary of State for International Development, said: “Our thoughts are with all those affected by this terrible earthquake. The UK is doing everything it can to help Nepal recover and provide assistance to British nationals caught up in the disaster.

“We are deploying highly trained experts in search and rescue and trauma medicine to pull people from the rubble and save lives. These are brave men and women who will be doing crucial, life-saving work on behalf of the UK.”
