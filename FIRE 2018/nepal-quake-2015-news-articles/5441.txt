TWO Taree doctors have traveled to Nepal to donate medical equipment, and their experience to those effected by the devastating Nepal earthquake.



Dr Anubha Singh and her husband, Dr Saing Thu Ya moved to Taree four months ago to work at Access Healthcare Taree.

The couple had planned to travel to Kathmandu to visit Dr Singh's family and attend her younger brother's wedding.

A week before leaving Australia, the earthquake hit Dr Singh's native town of Kathmandu.

Luckily her family was safe, but the couple are concerned about the little health facilities and medical equipment available to those severely injured.

Dr Saing Thu Ya, originally from Burma, said the couple have been in contact with other Nepalese doctors who are working in Australia, who will also go over to deliver aid.

"There are villages with few doctors," said Dr Anubha Singh.

"We would like to set up health camps in places that haven't had access to healthcare facilities."

The death toll of the earthquake has now passed 8000.
