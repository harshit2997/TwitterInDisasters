KANPUR: City folks felt fresh tremors caused by another earthquake that jolted Nepal, China and India at around 12:35 pm on Tuesday.Several Nepalese working in Industrial City remained worried throughout the day in order to know about the well-being of their near and dear ones in Nepal. Maina Bahadur, a labourer working at a hotel in Ghantaghar, said, "I have made several attempts to get in touch with my family members, who reside in Birganj district of Nepal, soon after the fresh tremors, but in vain." He said he was unable to contact his 60-year-old father Krishna living in Veerganj. Mahendra, another domestic help from Nepal, was anxious about the whreabouts of his elderly mother and children, who left for Nepal a few days back. He could not contact them.
