EDGE Hill man Som Tamang flies out of Cairns today for his homeland of Nepal knowing full well the devastation and personal tragedy that awaits.

“I just received a phone call to confirm that one of my brothers is dead, but one managed to escape,” he said.

“Right now I cannot imagine myself getting off the plane and making the steps up to the village, but I’m going to head straight up to the village and get an assessment done of how many people died and how many schools and houses are broken.”

His little brother and nephew managed to walk back to their village, Batase, as the aftershocks of the 7.8 magnitude earthquake shook the earth below.

Already more than 2500 lives have been lost, and the death count is rising.

Packed in Mr Tamang’s bags are solar panel phone chargers to help reconnect Nepal’s devastated villages.

“They have phones but no power so the first thing that’s really, really important is for us to help people contact their friends and family so we can do a count to know who’s OK,” he said. “The Nepalese Government is giving free phone calls for everyone.”

As the co-founder of the Friends of Himalayan Children he had raised $75,000 over eight years for Batase.

The school and houses they built have been reduced to rubble, but local builder Joseph Smogliani is determined to help build hope.

“I was in the building trade for 50 years so I have so much surplus material like trusses and doors and windows, you name it, that we’d like to organise something like that to restore that school,” he said.

But the logistics of providing aid, specifically construction materials, will prove near impossible in the mountainous, landlocked country.

Cairns Hospital paediatric ward clerk Linda Rowe has contacted colleagues to confirm she was safe.

It’s understood she and her husband Aaron arrived in Nepal as the earthquake struck. The Brinsmead couple are expected to arrive back in Cairns today.

They had set out to hike 5000m up to Everest’s base camp and had raised $5000 for the Cancer Council.
