After five days under the rubble of Nepal’s earthquake, a teenager has been pulled out alive.

Hopes were fading of finding more survivors after Saturday’s

disaster.

But in the ruins of a building in Kathmandu, the 15-year-old was waiting to be rescued.

As his condition is assessed, pictures have emerged of a baby rescued 22 hours after the quake flattened his home east of the capital.

The four-month-old boy’s cries alerted search teams. He is said to have escaped serious injury.

It is a symbol of hope amid so much tragedy.

Overwhelmingly it is bodies that are being found. Nearly 5,500 people were killed by the earthquake. Up to 10,000 are feared dead.

In rural mountainous regions, survivors have been scrambling for places on rescue helicopters.

Eight million people have been affected by the earthquake.

And with access difficult to remote regions, those who have lost everything and are now struggling with cold, hunger and the risk of disease, are desperate not to be forgotten.
