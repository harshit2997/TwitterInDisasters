Powerful new earthquake hits

devastated Nepal

Dozens dead as magnitude 7.3 earthquake

strikes two weeks after massive quake killed

thousands in Himalayan nation.



A deadly magnitude 7.3 earthquake has struck

Nepal, two weeks after a devastating quake

killed more than 8,000 people in the Himalayan

nation, the USGS has reported.

Officials said at least 36 people had been killed

and more than 1,100 injured in the new quake

in Nepal, which the USGS initially reported as

magnitude 7.1, before later upgrading it to

magnitude 7.3. In addition, the national disaster

management authority in India said 17 died

there.



The quake, which struck 18km southeast of

Kodari, near the base camp for Mt Everest, was

measured at a shallow depth of about 18km. A

series of aftershocks - including one 6.3

magnitude tremor - later hit in the same area,

the USGS reported.

The Nepalese Ministry of Home Affairs reported

that at least 36 people were killed in the quake

and at least 1,117 were injured.

At least 19 buildings have collapsed, officials

said, including 10 in Kathmandu.

Police issued a public warning, calling for

people to stay in open areas and to send text

messages instead of making calls, to prevent

the network from becoming jammed.



'Utter panic'

Al Jazeera's Annette Ekin, reporting from

Kathmandu, said that there was "utter panic" in

the capital following the quake.



"The earth just started rolling. Everyone ran out

onto the streets and all of the shops are now

shuttered," she said, adding that the quake

seemed to last about 30 seconds.

A woman who works for a finance company in

Thamel, in Kathmandu, told Al Jazeera that she

had clung on to a pillar inside her building

when the quake struck.

"I was screaming. It felt like the house was

falling," she said.

Al Jazeera's Andrew Simmons, also reporting

from Kathmandu, said the quake was so

powerful that it made the building he was in

"feel like jelly".

Tremors were felt in northern parts of

neighbouring India, Afghanistan and Indonesia.

Two hours after the quake struck, our

correspondent Ekin said that no one in

Kathmandu appeared willing to go back

indoors.



"Everyone is outside in the streets. At my hotel,

all of the staff and guests are sitting around

outside, waiting for more information," she

said.

Kathmandu's airport has been closed, following

the quake.

A 7.8-magnitude earthquake struck on April 25,

killing at least 8,046 people and injuring more

than 17,800.

Nepal and its citizens had witnessed two devastating quakes in less than two month, they live in constant fear and panic; they haven't even gotten over the shock of they last one, and they're facing a more powerful one right now. Many of use in Nigeria are in our various offices enjoying afternoon cool breeze in this hot sun. We have to praise and thank God for not putting us in life threatening predicament, even Ebola casualties in our beloved country isn't up to ten while it claimed thousands of life in Liberia, isn't that enough for us to lift up our bible and Quran right now and praise the most high for loving us. I'm very sure we won't have a chance to blame our politicians if we were to be facing a natural disaster.



I thank you lord for keeping my country save of any form of disasters, and may the soul of the affected Nepalese rest in peace. Amen! 69 Likes 6 Shares
