More than 2100 are confirmed dead after Saturday's earthquake in Nepal, including at least 4 Chinese nationals in the neighbouring country.



A major aftershock of magnitude 6.7 hit Nepal this afternoon.



Local authorities says the number of dead is likely to rise significantly.

Tens of thousands of Nepalese who spent the night outside under a chilly sky were jolted awake by strong aftershocks on Sunday. A local woman describes what what it felt like.



"While watching from the tea stall I saw the buildings fall and crumbling of nearby sites, then people escaped from the sites and spent the night inside tents and wherever was available. There are still trapped people, four or five still have not been brought out."



The aftershock lasted almost two minutes and triggered fresh avalanches.



The earthquake struck at a busy time of year for the tourism-reliant national's trekking and climbing season, with an estimated 300,000 foreign tourists in the country.



Mountaineering officials say 18 mountaineers have died on Mount Qomolangma, also known as Mount Everest, after the initial quake caused an avalanche.



The rescue operation has intensified in Nepal, with China sending a 60-strong emergency team, while India has flown in medical supplies and relief crews.



Rescuers are examining demolished buildings looking for survivors, as relatives of the missing stand nearby crying and praying.



Global charities are offering emergency aid to Nepal following the earthquake, while grappling to understand the scope of the disaster.



Sanitation, shelter, and medical help are urgently required.



Several charities are assembling disaster teams.



Many Chinese tourists evacuated from Nepal have arrived back in China.



An injured Chinese tourist, surnamed Mou, recals what happened.



"We could not stand still and my head was spinning. We had to hold each other, otherwise we could not stand still. It was very, very dangerous."

Over 680 Chinese tourists are stranded in Nepal.



China's Civil Aviation authority says that extra flights will be dispatched to pick up more trapped Chinese tourists.
