New Delhi :

With massive earthquake hitting Nepal, Prime Minister Narendra Modi today reached out to his counterpart Sushil Koirala as well as President Ram Baran Yadav and assured all help in dealing with the “tough” situation.

“Spoke to PM Sushil Koirala, who is in transit in Bangkok on his way to Kathmandu. Assured all support & assistance during this tough time,” Modi tweeted.

Modi, who is personally monitoring the situation at home as well as in Nepal, spoke to Yadav first as Koirala was abroad and not reachable.

Later, Modi talked to Koirala and assured him of “all assistance to deal with the situation arising due to the earthquake”, the PMO said.

A high-intensity quake shook Nepal’s capital, causing extensive damage to buildings.

The Prime Minister has also taken report of the situation in districts of Uttar Pradesh, Bihar and other states bordering Nepal besides speaking to the Sitamarhi MP.
