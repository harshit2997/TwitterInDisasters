MUMBAI: Two Dombivli residents are part of a six-member Indian team to Nepal to help animals in distress after the earthquake.In a situation where even relief for humans is inadequate, animals have been all but forgotten. But not by this animal-loving brigade, which has left for Nepal to tend to quake-afflicted fauna.Dombivli resident Nilesh Bhangane (37), who runs PAWS (Plants and Animals Welfare Society) , is part of the six-member team from India.Bhangane and another Dombivli resident, with four others, left for Nepal on Sunday, with food and medicine for animals.He said that he received a message from animal lovers in Nepal that there were many creatures that had been injured in the quake and in dire need of help as government agencies and others were mostly busy saving humans. This spurred Bhangane into action and he alerted other friends across India and the rescue mission set off.Talking to TOI on the phone, Bhangane said, "Many dogs, cats and birds died while several others were injured in the quake. Local veterinarians and animal lovers have treated many such injured animals, but it is in no way comparable to the assistance received by human victims. Animal welfare activists from other countries too have come forward to help.""I am happy that my brother has rushed to Nepal with all the food and medicine at his disposal to help animals in distress. As an animal lover, he realised their pain and felt he had to help," said Pradeep Bhangane.
