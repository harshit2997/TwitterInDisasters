<text>
Camping in Nepal for the past few days to help the earthquake victims, a team of the Shiromani Gurdwara Parbandhak Committee (SGPC) has moved to the remote areas of the country for providing relief there.

The SGPC claimed that its team had reached Sindhpol, the epicenter of the earthquake, and started relief operations in nearby areas, including Baatner, Dheempal, Beentan, Shipaghat, Kirtipur and few other places.

Since a lot of relief was pouring in Kathmandu, said the SGPC, it decided to move its teams to the rural areas, where people are still struggling to get help.

In a statement, SGPC media secretary Daljit Singh Bedi said, “Former secretary Dalmegh Singh, who is in Nepal along with the SGPC team, said apart from distributing food and dry rations among people, the SGPC team was also proving health facilities to the injured and sick. During the relief operation, the SGPC has also started distributing blankets and tents to the people who have no place to live.”

The SGPC team has setup camps where ‘langar’ (food) is being prepared and served by its volunteers. The SGPC is also getting food packets ready and distributing it among families living in the vicinity of the relief camp.

Notably, the SGPC has sent a medical team from its Guru Ram Dass Hospital in Amritsar. The team is lead by two doctors — Dr Angrez Singh and Dr Bhupinder Singh. They are providing free medical aid and medicines to the people.
