SINGAPORE - After spending 12 days in earthquake-hit Nepal carrying out relief operations, a Singapore Armed Forces (SAF) team returned home on Monday afternoon.

The SAF sent 38 servicemen comprising a medical team and staff from the Changi Regional Humanitarian Assistance and Disaster Relief Coordination Centre (RHCC).

The team returned in a Republic of Singapore Air Force (RSAF) C130 plane which touched down around 4.30pm at the Paya Lebar Air Base.

With them were seven doctors and nurses from the Ministry of Health and eight officers from the Royal Brunei Armed Forces, who worked with the SAF medical team.

Their family members waited at the Air Force Museum, near the air base.

Defence Minister Ng Eng Hen and Chief of Defence Force Lieutenant-General Ng Chee Meng received the returning personnel.

Dr Ng told reporters: "This has been a very good mission. We have been able to do what we wanted to do and we offer our deepest condolences to the people of Nepal.

"We learnt a lot of things...we will continue to learn but I'm very happy, satisfied with the performance of the (RHCC)."

Based in Gokarna, a village in Kathmandu, the combined medical team treated about 3,000 patients for injuries sustained in the earthquake, disaster-related illnesses and other ailments.

The RSAF also operated a total of 11 flights to Nepal since April 26, transporting people, equipment and relief supplies. It evacuated 71 Singaporeans and 24 Nepalese citizens. The SAF has donated $150,000 worth of humanitarian aid supplies including tents, blankets and food.
