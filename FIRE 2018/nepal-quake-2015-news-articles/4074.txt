International Rescue Corps charity founded by Marlow man Terry Price ready to mobilise for Nepal earthquake mission

Search and rescue teams from a charity co-founded by a Marlow resident are poised and ready to mobilise and help victims of the Nepal earthquake.

International Resuce Corps, set up by Terry Price in 1981 alongside Thunderbirds creator Gerry Anderson, say they are “monitoring” the situation in the region where over 5000 people are known to have died.

The charity, now based in Scotland, responds to man made and natural disasters in the UK and across the world.

And now members are readying themselves should they need to offer their support on the ground in mountainous Nepal, where an earthquake measuring 7.8 on the Richter scale hit on Saturday.

In a series of tweets in the aftermath, the charity said the UN had advised its search teams to stand down initially as the ground operation in place was “sufficient to cover identified needs".

But the charity said it remains on standby should anyone need their help in the coming days and weeks.

Workers tweeted: “We are continuing to monitor the situation in Nepal. As ever our thoughts and prayers are with those affected.

“As the search and rescue phase comes to an end with sufficient SAR teams on site there is still work to be done, including Needs assessments.

“We continue monitoring the Nepal situation as it develops from Search & Rescue Phase to Relief Phase over the coming days.”

Charity co-founder Mr Price has so far been unavailable to speak to the BFP due to embarking on a trip to Korea in his capacity as chairman of the British Korean War Veterans Association.
