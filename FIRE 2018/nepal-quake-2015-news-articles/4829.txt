Nepal: Anger grows as crisis worsens -- appeal for urgently needed aid
</headline>

<text>
"More than three-quarters of the buildings in Nepal’s capital, Kathmandu, are uninhabitable or unsafe following the 7.9-magnitude earthquake nine days ago, a new survey has revealed," The Guardian reported on May 4.

The news came while TeleSUR English reported on April 29 on the aftermath of the April 25 earthquake that struck the country on April 25: “Anger is erupting in Nepal after buses the government promised failed to arrive, and basic supplies start to run out.”

“People in Nepal told TeleSUR correspondent Aissa Garcia that aid wasn't reaching those who need it most.”

Time.com reported on April 30 that the death toll was feared to reach more than 15,000, with the death toll already standing at 5800.

TeleSUR English said people were helping each other. “Women are cooking for the whole community, in tents, squares, or streets … Nevertheless, needs are mounting, but promised help hasn't arrived.

“'Our government, no one has come here after four days to see what is happening,' Kiran Shrestha, a volunteer, said.”

Bharat Nepal, president of Australia Nepal Public Link Inc, has issued the following appeal for aid: “As you all know a very devastating earthquake hit Nepal on April 25. More than 5000 people were killed and more than 6000 are still missing. Outside of Kathmandu is also badly affected. However, due to remoteness damage has still not been fully appraised.

“There is great need for health care, food and water. I am coordinating to raise funds in Australia to address this crisis.

“If you can please support by donating to the following account, all money raised will be sent to National Disaster Relief Fund in Nepal. Thank you so much”
