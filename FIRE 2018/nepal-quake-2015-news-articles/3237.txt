Torrington and Winsted Rotarians raise funds for Nepal

TORRINGTON >> The Torrington and Winsted Rotary Club meeting this week focused on raising money for shelter boxes that will aid families recovering in Nepal.

In 2011, a group of people participating in a group study exchange led by Barbara Spiegel, executive director of the Susan B. Anthony Project, visited Nepal, a country that on Monday was devastated by a 7.9 magnitude earthquake.

The GSE program was run through the Torrington Rotary club at the time and through the trip, local members and non-members of the Rotary met and networked with Rotarians from the now devastated country.

The GSE program, which is no longer in operation, allowed one local Rotary Club member and four young professionals to travel to other parts of the world and live with other Rotarians. During her four weeks in Nepal, Spiegel said she stayed with 14 different host families — all of whom have been reported to be safe after the quake, she said this week.

Spiegel said that through Facebook, she was able to track down the friends in Nepal even as the death toll continues to rise above 4,000.

The shelter boxes that the members raised money for this week provide blankets, cooking utensils, tents, water purification equipment and mosquito tents.

Spiegel said the boxes are able to sustain a family for a month’s time.

The Rotary Club is hoping to raise enough money to buy at least two shelter boxes, officials said.
