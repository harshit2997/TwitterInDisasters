Two Young Women From Eugene Among Missing In Nepal
</headline>

Two young women from the Eugene area are among the missing after Saturday's earthquake in Nepal. Amber Brazil and Alicia Scroggins are graduates of Springfield's Thurston High School.

The 21-year old women embarked on a week long trek in Langtang National Park on April 19th. Amber Brazil is a University of Oregon student. She'd just finished up an internship at an elephant sanctuary in Thailand. In Nepal, she met up with her friend Alicia Scroggins, who now lives in New Zealand. Jennifer Brazil, Amber's mom, says based on their hiking itinerary, she believes they're in a valley that's been cut off from communication.

"They're both just amazing women. I'm sure that they are jumping in and helping with whatever they can. Nobody has had any of the bad feelings you get. Everybody just feels like they're okay. You just want to find them and find a way to get them home."

Jennifer Brazil says she's barely sleeping, getting information from the internet and news reports. She's hopeful she'll hear from Amber soon.
