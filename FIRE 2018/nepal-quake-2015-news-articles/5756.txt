Government warning over Nepal fundraising

The Government's minister responsible for the charity sector is warning people wanting to give money to help Nepal after its massive earthquake disaster to be careful.

Community and Voluntary Sector Minister Jo Goodhew says: "New Zealanders swift response to the appeals set up to provide assistance to victims of the Nepalese earthquakes has been incredible. It is a real tribute to New Zealand's generosity and sympathy for those facing a terrible disaster.

"However experience shows that although the vast majority of fundraising is genuine, the public should be mindful of people fundraising fraudulently."

Ms Goodhew is encouraging people to donate to well-established registered charities "that have the experience and infrastructure needed to provide disaster-relief assistance".

She has offered a series of checks, which she says only take a few minutes:

Check whether collectors are wearing an ID badge

Ask a collector for the charity's registration number, and check that against the charity's entry on the online Charities Register at www.charities.govt.nz

Ask the collector for more information - a fundraiser should be able to explain the work of the charity and how your donation will be used.

Fundraising materials should display the charity's name, registration number and a landline contact number - be wary of those that list only a mobile number or email address.

If in any doubt, contact your preferred charity directly to make a donation.
