KATHMANDU: The Malaysian Embassy here has confirmed that the body found in the Langtang area was indeed the remains of Malaysian national Raj Anthony.

Malaysian Embassy Charge d'Affaires Fadli Adilah said the deceased brother, Augustine Anthony, had arrived in Kathmandu yesterday to identify the body.

He said the confirmation came after a closed consultation with the family members of the deceased.

"We are assisting the family through the upcoming processes and procedures," he said in a statement posted on the embassy's Facebook page.

"We wish also to clarify that his passport was not found on him or that it will be returned together with the body," he added.

He said the embassy had notified the respective authorities to avoid the document from being misused by others.

It was learned that Raj had been missing for four days before the massive 7.9 magnitude earthquake rocked the country on April 25.
