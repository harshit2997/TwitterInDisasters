12.15 p.m. (0630 GMT)

An expedition doctor and base camp manager for a trekking group says that all those injured in Saturday’s quake-triggered avalanche have been evacuated and the dead bodies flown out.

Dr. Nima Namgyal Sherpa says at least five teams are still waiting to hear if they will get permission to scale the summit.

Sherpa says they “have not made the decision to quit yet.”

The others are now salvaging whatever they can and planning to trek down from base camp, Sherpa told The Associated Press in a WhatsApp message.

The government will decide within the week whether they’ll close the mountain or allow the climbers to proceed. At least 18 people were killed in the avalanche and more than 4,400 in the earthquake.

The World Food Program says 1.4 million people are in need of immediate help following last week’s earthquake that killed more than 4,400 people, most of them in Nepal

WFP emergencies officer Geoff Pinnock says it has identified eight places that are in need of critical help and “our focus is on relief operations in those places.”

Those areas in Gorkha district, where the earthquake was centered, are Ghyachol, Saurpani, Warpak, Larpak, Gundra, Lapa, Kashigaun and Kerauja.

An American doctor working at a hospital in Kathmandu, says about 90 percent of the houses are “just flattened” in Gorkha district, and hundreds of thousands of people are homeless after Saturday’s earthquake.

Rebecca McAteer says her team was the first to arrive in many places in Gorkha, where the earthquake’s epicenter was located. More than 4,400 people were killed in the earthquake.

She said these villages have very poor infrastructure with flimsy homes, and the residents are mostly older women and men, and children.

She said “the young men have all left to look for work elsewhere.”

Italy’s Foreign Ministry says four Italians are believed to be among those killed in the earthquake in Nepal over the weekend that killed more than 4,400 people.

The ministry says that based on information from their travel companions they were killed in the Langtang area, but noted that the area is still hard to access.

The ministry also said its crisis unit had not been able to reach about 40 Italian citizens believed to have been in the area.

Army troops are loading blue tarpaulin sheets, medical kits and dehydrated food, water bottles, sacks of rice and blankets at a flat area that is being used as a helipad in Gorkha town.

Gorkha district was the epicenter of Saturday’s magnitude 7.8 earthquake that has killed more than 4,400 people.

With the weather clearing it seems that for now helicopters will be able to pick up the supplies and relay to smaller villages.

The weather has been erratic over the last two days â” there has been some rain and cloud cover making it difficult for helicopters to land in some areas close to the epicenter.

A team of 37 New Zealand urban search-and-rescue experts due to leave Monday night for Kathmandu has been told at the 11th hour not to come.

New Zealand Foreign Minister Murray McCully said in a statement that Nepal’s government had informed him they had enough expertise in the country and the team was no longer required.

New Zealand has contributed 1 million New Zealand dollars ($761,000) to the relief effort following Saturday’s earthquake that killed more than 4,400 people.

Army troops are loading bags of rice and cornmeal into a storage room at the district headquarters in Gorkha, the epicenter of Saturday’s massive earthquake.

District official Surya Mohan Adhikari says the supplies will be sent out later in the day to villages that need them most.

He said that in the rural areas 90 percent of the people have been affected “by this calamity. They have lost their homes and livestock. They have no way of getting food.”

He says it is very difficult to reach them. They are cut off by landslides on the mountain roads, and the wind and rain is making it difficult for helicopters to land.

Adhikari said they have reports of some 300 casualties, but that number is rising. Nationwide, more than 4,400 people have been killed in the magnitude 7.8 quake.
