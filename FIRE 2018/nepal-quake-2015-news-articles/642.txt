One Hour Translation Supports Rescue Teams Heading to Nepal Disaster Zone

WASHINGTON, April 26, 2015 /PRNewswire via COMTEX/ -- WASHINGTON, April 26, 2015 /PRNewswire/ --

One Hour Translation , the world's largest online translation agency, is offering free professional translation services to rescue teams working in Nepal free of charge. The 2011 National census in Nepal lists 123 languages spoken as a mother tongue with only 45% of the population speaking Nepali as their mother tongue, making the challenge for rescue teams even greater.

Timely and accurate translation improves the ability of rescue missions on the ground to communicate effectively with victims, partner organisations and volunteers, contributing to the overall success of the mission. One Hour Translation will help overcome the language barrier between the people of Nepal and the multiple international organizations, and between the organizations themselves.

In the past, One Hour Translation's professional translation services were used extensively by rescue teams to overcome language barriers following disasters in Japan, Haiti and the Philippines.

"We are certain that our translation services will assist the rescue teams and the victims," said Ofer Shoshan, CEO of One Hour Translation. "Unfortunately we already have experience in such disasters. Our 24x7 service and support team are already prepared to help with the translation projects related to the disaster".
