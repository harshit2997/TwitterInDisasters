BOISE, Idaho (KBOI) - A group of Boise State students from Nepal organized a candlelight vigil on campus Tuesday night. They raised money to send overseas and remembered the lives lost in the earthquake.



Ujjwal Roy, president of the Nepalese Student Association, says the disaster took his cousin's life.



"This way, we can pray for the lives that were lost in Nepal," Roy said.



More than a hundred people, a mix of students and families, gathered near BSU's administration building at 7 p.m. Candles in hand, they listened, had a moment of silence and sang Nepal's national anthem.



"I am from India, and I saw the news, and it is so terrible there," said Anu Khurana of Boise, "so we were just thinking how we can help our friends."



Shital Dhakal is one of 22 Nepalese students at BSU.



"Our house suffered a little disaster," Dhakal said. "Though it's not collapsed totally, there are some cracks in the building so there's no way they can stay in the houses."



Some made donations to the relief efforts.



"If you just do the math, one dollar is almost a hundred rupees back home," Dkahal said, "so that means with one dollar, one can buy a meal, a lunch for themselves."



Parika Das was born in Nepal. Her parents survived the quake but have slept in their car for days, fearful of aftershocks.



"Right now, the people of Nepal do need support financially," said Das, who's lived in Boise since 1999. "They do need a lot of support."



Nepalese students say BSU administrators and professors have been supportive, sending emails and offering to help them. They hope the event raised awareness of the situation in their country and the needs that are still there.
