Katmandu: At a time when Nepal is battling to bring back life to normalcy after a massive earthquake of 7.9 magnitude that hit the country last Saturday, the relief material sent by Pakistan has created a new controversy.

According to India Today reports, Pakistan, in the name of relief material, has reportedly sent ready-to-eat ‘beef masala’ packets as part of relief material to Nepal victims.

Nepal, being a majority-Hindu country treats cows as sacred and has imposed a blanket ban on slaughtering the animal.

Indian doctors at Kathmandu’s Bir Hospital told media that the relief food packets contained ‘beef masala’.

While the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) hit out at Pakistan for sending the beef masala, it also evoked strong protest on social media site.

Meanwhile, according to the India Today report, both, the Pakistan Air Force and the government had no information about it.

A top Nepal government official told Daily Mail that the matter has been conveyed to Prime Minister Sushil Koirala and the intelligence chief.

“We are also starting an internal inquiry to verify the facts. If the report is correct, we will raise the matter at the diplomatic level with Pakistan,” the offical said to Daily Mail.
