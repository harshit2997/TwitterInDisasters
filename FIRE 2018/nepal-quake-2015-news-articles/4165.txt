A MAN who was in Nepal's capital, Kathmandu, when the devastating earthquake hit has described the horror of that day and the fear he would not survive.

Satya Narayan Shrestha, who arrived at Dubbo this week, lives in Chitwan, a city 150 kilometres from Kathmandu.

Mr Shrestha had travelled to the capital where he was to fly to Sydney before continuing on to Dubbo where he will stay for a year, and see the city his son Sanjib has lived since 2012.

However, late last Saturday morning a magnitude 7.8 (M7.8) earthquake hit the Himalayan country, striking 80 kilometres north-west of Kathmandu, flattening entire parts of the city.

Mr Shrestha revealed when the earthquake hit he immediately feared for his life.

"I was very fearful and it was a terrible day," Mr Shrestha said.

"It was very scary thinking that I could end up at the bottom of the house with all the rubble on top of me.

"Even when we got out of the house and onto the street, you didn't feel any safer as the ground was shaking so much."

For Mr Shrestha's son the ordeal was just as horrifying as he knew his father was in the city at the time of the earthquake and he was unable to contact him.

"I was extremely worried," Sanjib said.

"I was expecting him to fly (out of Kathmandu) that night and then heard the news of the earthquake and then we couldn't make contact.

"When we did get in touch and heard he was OK it was a big relief."

With the death toll already more than five thousand and tens of thousands left homeless and short of food and water, Dubbo's Nepalese community have come together and organised a fundraising effort which has been supported by the Australian Red Cross Dubbo branch.

On Friday, members of the Nepalese community and the Red Cross Australia will have a stall outside Dubbo Square, 177 Macquarie Street, from 9am to 5pm, as they did on Thursday.

You can also head online to redcross.org.au or phone 1800 811 700 to offer your support.

The Commonwealth Bank is accepting over-the-counter donations for the Nepal Region Earthquake Appeal.
