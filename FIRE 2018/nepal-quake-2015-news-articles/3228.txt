Local Red Cross chapter supports Nepal efforts - NBC12 - WWBT - Richmond, VA News On Your Side

The Red Cross has launched an international response to the earthquake disaster in Nepal.

The Nepal Red Cross is leading the efforts on the ground, providing food, water, and first aid as well as assisting in the on-going search and rescue operation. The American Red Cross has already committed $300,000, which will be used to put together thousands of relief kits that contain clothing, kitchen sets, tarps, mosquito nets, and personal hygiene items. The organization will be assessing the situation in the coming days to see what other supplies and resources will be needed.

While the Red Cross receives many requests from people that want to donate supplies, the organization says this is not ideal. "That takes a significant amount of man power to obviously collect those items, sort through them, and then ship them over. And by the time they would get to those impacted by the disaster, those needs can change," said the Red Cross of Virginia's Jonathan McNamara. The organization asks that you make monetary donations instead. This allows the Red Cross to purchase supplies directly in Nepal which limits shipping costs, stimulates the local economy, and allows the people that need the supplies to receive them as quickly as possible.

To make a donation, go to Redcross.org, or call the local Red Cross here in Richmond at 804-780-2250. The more donations the Red Cross receives, the more they will be able to assist in Nepal in the months and possibly years to come.
