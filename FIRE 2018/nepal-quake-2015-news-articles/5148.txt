SAN DIEGO (CBS 8) - On Sunday, U.S. planes carrying 100 Marines arrived in Kathmandu to help provide aid to the thousands affected by last weekend's earthquake.

The death toll is at more than 7,000 and search and rescue teams will now try and rescue people from some of the more remote areas.

Amber Cheffins, a nurse here in San Diego, will also be heading to Nepal in a few weeks with a medical team that performs surgeries on people injured in disaster zones. Currently, they are still raising money for supplies and on Sunday, her 10-year-old son did his part to help them.

CBS News 8's Kelly Hessedal has more details in this video report.
