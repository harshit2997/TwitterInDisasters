SILIGURI: The state government has decided to set up a crisis management group to maintain a database and coordinate with relevant departments to help the administration tackle after-effects of natural disaster. The decision was taken on Monday at a meeting held by chief minister Mamata Banerjee to take stock of the situation post Saturday's earthquake.GTA chief Bimal Gurung was invited to the meeting, but he did not turn up. "I don't want to get into politics now. I had asked him to come. Maybe he is busy distributing relief material. Or, maybe some sentiments are involved," Mamata said.A day after visiting the homes of quake victims at Naxalbari and Mirik, Mamata on Monday announced the government's plan to introduce a system that would work round-the-clock. A 24-hour toll-free helpline was set up in North Bengal in addition to the one at Nabanna.The CM entrusted director-general (armed police) Raj Kanojia with the responsibility to coordinate efforts to kickstart the crisis management group for North Bengal. It will be headquartered in Siliguri. As of now, Siliguri police commissioner Manoj Verma would look after relief measures for Nepal earthquake victims. A bus will leave shortly with families whose kin are stranded in Nepal. Mamata on Monday stressed that she was not worried over relief funds from the Centre."She also proposed setting up 10-member groups — Sevashree — at the local level. The group is likely to be the first responders in times of crisis and act as a support system for affected families.After her visit to Mirik, Banerjee said she was surprised to see "highrises" that have sprung up in the Hills in recent years. "When natural disaster strikes, these could collapse like a house of cards. How can such highrises come up?" Mamata wondered.
