FREDERICTON – People from the Nepalese community in New Brunswick are still desperately trying to reach family members back home in earthquake ravaged Nepal.

Images of the devastation in Nepal are almost too much for Gopi Adhikari to bare.

“I am feeling really sad.”

Adhikari now lives in Fredericton, but grew up in Nepal for 18 years before moving to Canada five years ago. He says right now, he feels helpless because he is still unable to reach some family members back home in Kathmandu Valley.

“I am trying to contact them and I can still not getting any answer from them.”

He says he fears the worst, that his grandfather’s brother and his family were among the thousands who didn’t survive.

On Tuesday, a small group of the 112 members of the Bhutanese-Nepali Association of New Brunswick gathered in Fredericton to develop a plan to help raise money for people suffering back home.

“We cannot control this disaster but what we can do is we as a humanitarian way we can collect some funds from the people from our local community and help them to get relief from that pain,” he said.

Ram Kharel also has family back home in Nepal. He says he managed to reach his aunt and uncle who are taking shelter in a tent camp. But two of his cousins are still among the missing.

“They may be alive they may be dead but the situation is out of control,” he said.

Which is why the group is calling on the people of New Brunswick to help. The Bhutanese-Nepali Association of N.B. will start accepting donations to help with relief efforts in Nepal.

“They are really in a desperate situation and they are looking for help any help given not only to my family but to the whole all the Nepalese people at this time would be highly appreciated.”

Kharel, who works as a home support worker for the Canadian Red Cross in Fredericton says all the money will be given to the Canadian Red Cross and forwarded on to the Red Cross in Nepal.

In the meantime, they will keep praying that by some miracle their families are found safe.

“My thoughts and prayers are with my family back home in Nepal and all of the Nepali people affected by this terrible earthquake.”
