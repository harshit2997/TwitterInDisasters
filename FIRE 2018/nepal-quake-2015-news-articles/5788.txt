Calgary coming out in support of Nepal quake victims

Calgarians are coming forward to support those affected by last week’s earthquake in Nepal.

Several events are planned in the city.

“It’s heartbreaking, devastating,” said Ana Kalpana Dhakal, spokeswoman for the Nepalese Community Society of Calgary (NCSC.)

“Luckily my family was not affected, but all of my good friends are gone.”

A memorial evening and donation drive organized by the NCSC was held Thursday evening at Marlborough community hall, leading up to a candlelight vigil Friday evening at 7 p.m. at City Hall, in conjunction with the Calgary Nepalese Community Association.

Radio station 106.7 RED FM will host an all-day radiothon to benefit quake victims, with proceeds going towards the Canadian Red Cross.

In addition, Calgary-based charity Place2Give has launched a relief fund.
