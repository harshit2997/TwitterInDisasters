NEW DELHI: Congress Vice President Rahul Gandhi today visited the Nepal embassy here to pay condolences to those who died in the killer earthquake in the neighbouring country.

He signed on the visitor's register and had a word with the officials in the embassy.

The Himalayan country was devastated by a powerful earthquake last week which has left over 6,000 people dead and at least 11,000 injured.

"Gandhi went to the Nepal embassy to pay tributes to those who died in the massive tragedy," a Congress leader said.

India has played a key role in relief and rescue work in Nepal in the aftermath of the disaster.

The quake has also affected parts of India, particularly bordering Bihar, and has claimed the lives of over 70 people.
