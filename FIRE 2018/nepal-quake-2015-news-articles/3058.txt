Prabal Gurung sets up fund for Nepal earthquake victims

Nepalese designer Prabal Gurung is calling on the world to donate money to help those affected by the 7.9 magnitude earthquake which has devastated his home country. With the help of CrowdRise, the designer is raising relief funds through his charity, Shikshya Foundation Nepal. He wants to hit $500,000. So far, he's raised half that amount, with the CFDA donating $10,000.

Born in Singapore, Gurung was raised in Nepal's capital, Kathmandu. He moved to New York in 1999 to pursue his fashion career, but Nepal remains close to his heart, particularly during a time of such severe adversity. Gurung describes Nepal as "a constant source of inspiration"; his family still lives there.

In one interview with the Wall Street Journal, an exhausted Gurung told of his concern for loved ones in the aftermath of the disaster and the pain of "sitting here when your familyâ€™s out there and you feel so helpless".
