Life-saving Red Cross aid is reaching people hit by the Nepal earthquake.

With rain forecast, thousands of tarpaulins have been given out in central Kathmandu, as well as its busy suburbs of Bakhtapur and Lalitpur and areas further afield.

These include Ramechhap to the east of the city, Gorkha to the west, and Sinhupalhchowk and Dolakha to the north.

An appeal funding the vital help has raised £2million in just a few days.

Aid given out has also included thousands of packets of oral rehydration salts and aqua tabs. These can purify dirty drinking water – cutting the risk from deadly diseases like cholera, which are a huge threat after disasters.

This vital aid was already stored in Nepal in case of a major emergency. The Red Cross is sending more supplies and aid workers to the country in the coming days.

Red Cross spokesman Stephen Cox said: “This help is a lifeline for families forced to sleep in the open by Saturday’s earthquake. But there’s so much still to do.”

First aid for hundreds as soon as disaster struck

New figures have revealed that Red Cross volunteers gave first aid to more than 800 people on the weekend of the disaster. This proved vital as hospitals have been overwhelmed in the aftermath of the earthquake.

The Red Cross has given thousands of people in Nepal first aid training in recent years.

Appeal reaches £2m

The Red Cross Nepal Earthquake Appeal has raised £2m within days of being launched. This has included a contributions from thousands of members of the public as well as The Freemasons' Grand Charity, which gives grants to a range of good causes.

The total has also been boosted by the Disaster Relief Alliance. This network, which includes founding corporate member Tesco, has already helped communities in disaster prone areas such as Nepal prepare for emergencies.
