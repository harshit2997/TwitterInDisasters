UAH community shows solidarity for victims of Nepal earthquake

The earthquake that devastated Nepal and last weekend has claimed more than 5,000 lives couldn't have happened any farther away from Huntsville, Alabama. But that doesn't mean the local community isn't invested.

The courtyard of UAH's Charger Union was packed Thursday night as students and community members lit candles in support of everyone affected. The heartfelt attendees wanted to express their sympathies. It was also a time to spread the word of ways to get financial help to Nepal.

"We're just supporting the people. Be strong. Be supportive. That's why we are here," said Damber Budhathoki of the Nepalese Association of North Alabama. This is the group that joined with UAH for the vigil.

They were there to offer prayers, said Madhay Mainali, also of the Nepalese Association of North Alabama. He and Budhathoki said the people over there have been so hurt both emotionally and physically. Families have been lost and survivors are in the hospital. They wanted to offer the local community a way to send prayers and share communal support.

"We are all with you guys. We are far away from you but we still are hurt," said Mainali.

This was the driving sprit behind all those who put this vigil together in a short amount of time. One of these people is Surya Chhetri, who is a UAH Ph.D. student in biotechnology. He said it could have been any of their families who were hurt and that made this an important matter.

"We really feel bad for the other people out there so it's kind of really heart-wrenching to see the chaos going on," Chhetri said. "People looking for those basic necessities, people having those terrible feelings. They just need hope to survive."

"So this is kind of a common cause to bring us together to make them feel that we are with them. They're not alone. We will fight this situation. We'll brave this situation together," he continued.

It was also a chance to encourage financial support, such as through the Red Cross. Several organizations have been sending support to Nepal. Click here to read AL.com writer Kay Campbell's tips on contributing to Nepal's relief efforts.

Condolences were shared for the dead and hope shared for the survivors. Samon Shrestha, a UAH graduate student in chemistry, feels for the victims. He knows these are difficult times and showed up Thursday to do show solidarity. The large turnout showed him others feel the same.

"I hope this provides some support for the people back in Nepal," he said.

Some in Huntsville have been directly affected by the earthquake. Beverly Brown was on an art tour in Nepal when her group became trapped by a landslide. Her daughter, Rachel Brown Matthews, said Brown was rescued and is on her way home to Huntsville.

Shrestha has a friend whose house in Nepal has been affected. This friend is in another city and is safe, something Shrestha is grateful for.
