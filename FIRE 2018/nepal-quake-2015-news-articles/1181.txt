More than 1,000 people have been killed in Nepalâ€™s deadliest earthquake for more than 80 years. The 7.8 magnitude quake struck an area of central Nepal between the capital, Kathmandu, and the city of Pokhara. There were also victims in India, Bangladesh, Tibet and on Mount Everest, where avalanches were triggered.

The government has declared a state of emergency in the affected areas, and help has been offered by countries around the world.
