<text>
A candle-lit vigil will be held in Christchurch Friday, to show support for the Nepalese community following last week's devastating earthquake.

The vigil will be hosted by the Nepalese community, with support from the Student Volunteer Army and Christchurch City Council.

President of the New Zealand Nepalese Friendship Society Professor Rajesh Dhakal, Everest climber Mark Inglis, and Mayor Lianne Dalziel, will all speak at the vigil.

Candles will be available for lighting at the vigil and the Student Volunteer Army will be collecting donations, which will go towards recovery work in Nepal.
