"I have appealed people to observe two minute silence tomorrow sharp at 11 AM as a mark of respect to those who have lost their lives in the earthquake that jolted Nepal. I have also urged people to donate money to help rebuild the quake-ravaged nation and will launch the drive for the same tomorrow from Bhopal," Chouhan told reporters last evening.



Besides, Ministers and other members of the ruling party will also launch similar drives in their respective districts, he said.



The money collected for the cause will be handed over to the Prime Minister's Relief Fund so that it can be used for rebuilding Nepal, Chouhan said.



The state government has launched an online account number for making donations.



Following instructions from the Centre, the state has already dispatched large number of tents and other relief material to the quake-hit Himalayan nation.



So far, 7,276 people have died and 14,267 people were injured in the earthquake which shook Nepal on April 25. Latest News from Madhya Pradesh News Desk
