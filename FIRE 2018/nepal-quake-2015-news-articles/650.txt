ABU DHABI// Sheikh Hamdan bin Zayed Al Nahyan, the ruler’s representative in the Western Region and chairman of the Emirates Red Crescent (ERC), has instructed the ERC to provide urgent humanitarian assistance to people affected by the earthquake that struck Nepal on Saturday.

A group of ERC aid workers along with the Ministry of Interior’s Search and Rescue (SAR) team will fly to Nepal on Sunday to participate in the rescue operations.

Another ERC delegation will travel to the Indian capital New Delhi to purchase food and medical supplies to be airlifted to the quake-affected areas.
