Bahraini volunteers from the Royal Charity Organisation (RCO) have started relief work in Nepal to help survivors of last month's deadly earthquake.

Tents have been set up in Kathmandu to provide shelter for displaced families and aid has been distributed.

RCO secretary general Dr Mustafa Al Sayed described the situation as 'grim' but said he was amazed at the 'strength, calm and resilience of the people of Nepal'.

'The people are full of praise for the benevolence of His Majesty King Hamad and the effective aid leadership of RCO chairman Shaikh Nasser bin Hamad Al Khalifa,' he said.

A BDF team from the National Guards, headed by Shaikh Isa bin Abdulla Al Khalifa, is also carrying out relief work, distributing food parcels and survival packs with Nepalese military volunteers.
