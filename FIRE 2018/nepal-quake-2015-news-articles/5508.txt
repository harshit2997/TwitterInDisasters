A Nepalese man living in Glasgow has described his joy at finally hearing from family members following the devastating earthquake in his country.

Kashiram Poudel had been unable to reach his wife's family in Nepal by telephone since the disaster.

He had been scanning Facebook for any information until finally on Tuesday he received a call and heard the voices of his in-laws.

Mr Poudel said the phone call revealed that very little outside help had reached his family's village, where it is feared more than 80 have died, including five of his cousins.

His relatives told him that they have been unable to recover all of the dead.

Mr Poudel's own parents survived and are living a tent with around 20 others. But aid agencies are warning the makeshift camps provide a perfect breeding ground for disease.

More than 7000 people are known to have died in the earthquake, which struck Nepal's Gorkha district on April 25.

Scotland has so far donated £3.5m to the Disasters Emergency Committee, and aid agencies expect to be in Nepal for many months to come.
