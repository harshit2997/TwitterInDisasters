PATNA: Fresh tremors with a 5.1 magnitude on the Richter scale were felt in different parts of Bihar on Monday evening and Chief Minister Nitish Kumar said the death toll had touched 57.

He said the government would extend the Rs 4-lakh ex gratia announced earlier for the families of the deceased quake victims to those from the state who died in Nepal.

Even the Nepalese who were killed while visiting their relatives in the state will also receive the same quake relief benefits, he added.

The Chief Minister further said that 10 buses had been sent to Pokhara to bring back stranded people via Raxual and that 30 more buses would be sent to Kathmandu. Nitish said the government was working in coordination with Centre to carry out relief operations in the affected areas of the state as well as to extend help to Nepal. Also, the government dispatched 10,000 food packets in two trucks from the Raxaul border. As per the state Disaster Management Department’s report, the district-wise breakup of the casualties is: 11 in East Champaran, seven in Darbhanga and Sitamarhi, six in Araria, three each in Sheohar, Siwan and Lakhisarai, two each in Supual, Madhubani, Saharsa and Saran, one each in Gaya, Nalanda, West Champaran, Katihar, Munger, Muzaffarpur, Samastipur and Patna.
