Support for Nepal
</headline>

<text>
THE Bendigo members of the National Malaya and Borneo Veterans Association are most concerned about the recent devastating earthquake in Nepal, the home of the famous Gurkha soldiers who have fought alongside Australian troops in conflicts from World War I to today.

Annually our branch sends 1000 pounds sterling to support the Gurkha Welfare Trust which provides isolated villages with medical assistance, water and sanitation and school programs.

In this poverty stricken country, that donation provided a monthly welfare pension for 22 Gurkha ex-servicemen and widows.

Every cent given goes directly to the needy as the British government covers all administrative expenses.

This year is the 200th anniversary of the Gurkha Regiments and as some members served with the 17th Gurkha Regiment in the Malaya Emergency, 1948-1960, we are most concerned for their ageing comrades.

While the Australian government has pledged $5 million in aid to Nepal, I urge Bendigo people to add to this and if possible, to support the Gurkha Welfare Trust.
