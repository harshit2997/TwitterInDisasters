Ittefaq Report

The airports of Bangladesh can be used by foreign countries to send aid to Nepal.

The decision was taken during the cabinet meeting chaired by Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina on Monday afternoon. After the meeting, Primary and Mass Education Minister Mustafizar Rahman Fizar stated, “Foreign countries can use the airports if they need to send relief materials to Nepal.”

At least 3,218 people are now known to have died in a massive earthquake which hit Nepal on Saturday.

Rameshwor Dangal, head of Nepal’s disaster management agency, said another 6,500 people had been injured.

Bangladesh also sent six medical teams and necessary relief materials to help the people affected in a devastating earthquake in Nepal.
