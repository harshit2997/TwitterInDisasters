PEMBROKE -

The humanitarian efforts of Phil Sheppard, the Pembroke native caught in the devastating Nepal earthquake, are being praised by city council.

Speaking on a point of order Tuesday night, Deputy Mayor Ron Gervais said the 26-year-old physiotherapist is making his hometown proud for setting aside concerns over his personal safety to selflessly help the victims of the April 25 disaster.

“There were many individuals who left,” Gervais said during the regular meeting of council. “He was one who could have left and he decided not to leave.”

The death toll of the magnitude 7.8 temblor, Nepal’s worst in more than 80 years, has reached more than 7,500. A total of 57 foreign nationals have been confirmed killed, including 40 Indians, one Briton, one Spaniard, and four Americans. Sheppard, a graduate of Queen's University, had been in the central Asian nation for a month volunteering at a paediatric hospital and school for disabled children. He was in the tiny mountain village of Jhinu Danda when the quake struck.

In the days after the catastrophe, Sheppard acted as a contact for international relief organizations and non-governmental organizations (NGOs) attempting to deliver humanitarian aid to villages and towns outside the capital of Katmandu. Last week, Garrison Petawawa dispatched the Disaster Assistance Response Team (DART) sending an undisclosed amount of local troops to Nepal.

“He tried to co-ordinate with outside agencies such as the Red Cross, Doctors Without Borders, Handicap International, the DART team,” said Gervais.

Putting his medical skills to work, he worked at a hospital in Pokhara, Nepal's second-largest city and triaged patients arriving by ambulance. Gervais noted that while the international relief effort focused their attention on the larger cities, Sheppard expressed concern for those remote mountain villages that were far worse off.

“He took it upon himself to stay despite the unrest and assist those people,” said Gervais. “People like that need to be recognized. Pembroke should be proud of their own who go above and beyond.”

The deputy mayor added that Sheppard's story is now being told by several media outlets including the CBC and the worldwide BBC News Service.
