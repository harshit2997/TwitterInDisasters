●Relief supplies from Taiwan to reach Nepal Tuesday: official (Monday evening)



Taipei, April 27 (CNA) Nepal has declined Taiwan's offer to help with search and rescue efforts after the Himalayan country was devastated by a magnitude 7.8 earthquake Saturday, Vice Foreign Minister Andrew Kao said Monday.



Kao's comments came as several local search and rescue teams were preparing to depart for Nepal to help look for survivors under collapsed buildings.



Answering questions at the Legislative Yuan, the vice minister said that Kathmandu so far has only asked for assistance in search and rescue efforts from neighboring countries like China, India and Pakistan and cited the lack of direct flights and diplomatic relations for declining Taiwan's offer.



Taiwan will still send an advanced team to Nepal, however, to assess the need for for medical assistance, which Taiwan stands ready to provide, said Kao.
