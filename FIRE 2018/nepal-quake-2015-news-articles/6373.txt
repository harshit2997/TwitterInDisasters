Gov. Scott sends condolences to family of U.S. Marine killed in Nepal crash
</headline>

<text>
After it was confirmed that one of the six U.S. Marines killed in a helicopter crash during a relief effort in Nepal was from Central Florida, Gov. Rick Scott has extended condolences to his family.

Sgt. Ward M. Johnson IV, 29, attended Seminole State College, where he earned two degrees. Although he had since moved to California with his wife and two children, his parents still live in Altamonte Springs.

"Today, we join all Floridians in praying for the families who lost loved ones in last week's tragedy in Nepal, especially for the family of Sgt. Ward M. Johnson from Florida," Scott said in a written statement. "Like so many members of the U.S. armed forces before them, these brave soldiers were on a mission to selflessly help others who are facing enormous challenges as they begin to build back from a disaster."

Johnson and the other Marines were in helicopter with two Nepalese soldiers, who also died. Their helicopter crashed while on a humanitarian mission in devastated Nepal, which is reeling from two major earthquakes in three weeks.

More than 8,000 people were killed in the earthquakes, and many thousands more were hurt.

The group was delivering rice and tarps in one of the worst-hit areas on May 12 when the helicopter disappeared.

The other U.S. Marines who were killed were:

•Capt. Dustin R. Lukasiewicz of Nebraska

•Capt. Christopher L. Norgren of Kansas

•Sgt. Eric M. Seaman of California

•Cpl. Sara A. Medina of Illinois

•Lance Cpl. Jacob A. Hug of Arizona

Nepal's army identified its soldiers as Tapendra Rawal and Basanta Titara.
