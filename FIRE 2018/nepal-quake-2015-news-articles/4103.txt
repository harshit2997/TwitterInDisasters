Under the directives of President His Highness Sheikh Khalifa bin Zayed Al Nahyan and as per the order of His Highness Sheikh Mohamed bin Zayed Al Nahyan, Crown Prince of Abu Dhabi and Deputy Supreme Commander of the UAE Armed Forces, to deliver urgent humanitarian assistance to the people of Nepal by shipping quantities of humanitarian aid to those affected by the devastating earthquake that killed thousands of people and left tens of thousands homeless as well.

An official source from the Khalifa bin Zayed Al Nahyan Foundation stated that the Foundation received urgent instructions from the leadership for immediate action to help those affected in Nepal. As a first step, the foundation has sent rescue workers to India and another team to Nepal, and will work at full speed to secure convoys of emergency relief for those affected, with the purchase of relief materials from the Indian market which can be quickly shipped to Nepal.
