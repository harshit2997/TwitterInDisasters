Five Polish planes carrying 15 tonnes of aid reached Nepal over the weekend, as the Himalayan country struggled to cope with the consequences of its worst earthquake in 80 years.

The planes, which flew from Warsaw and Kraków, transported items including water purification tablets, tents, blankets, sleeping bags, clothes, as well as food and various types of medication.

The items were purchased by Polish humanitarian groups after a major fund-raising appeal. Poland's ministry of defence also contributed.

By Monday morning, the official death toll of the 25 April earthquake had exceeded 7250 people.

Over 3 million people are in need of foodstuffs as a result of the tragedy.

On Saturday 2 May, the Nepalese government ruled out finding any more survivors beneath the rubble, after seven days of searching.

Miraculously however, a 101-year-old man was rescued later that day in the Nuwakot district, about 50 miles northwest of Kathmandu. Likewise, three women were rescued on Sunday in the Sindupalchowk district of central Nepal.

A team of 81 Polish firefighters is now due to return to Warsaw early this week. (nh)
