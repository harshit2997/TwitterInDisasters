West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee, who visited a hospital in Siliguri today and met those injured after a powerful earthquake struck Nepal and sent tremors through northern India, said that her government would announce relief after collecting reports from all over the state.

Banerjee also met the doctors and the nurses at the hospital and inquired about the health of the recovering patients.

Banerjee later told the media that she saw many patients, who have sustained 60 percent injuries.

"Many patients have lost their limbs and have sustained injuries on their waist, head and shoulders. I spoke to all of them and the hospital authorities are doing good work. I have instructed the nurses to be prepared for any emergency. The doctor and nurses are spending extra time to take care of the patients. This is to be done in North Bengal Medical College as well as in Siliguri," said Banerjee.

"I already told you that when I was at the airport that how the government would help the injured and the victims. I am going to Meerik now to meet family of deceased," she added.

The TMC supremo further said that she was right now not in a position to give details about the exact number of deaths in the state.

"I cannot give the total number as there are deaths in Kalinpong, Meerik. There been damage. Schools are closed on Sundays. So, until I visit I cannot tell. In Kolkata, the bridges and building have cracked. Today also, there have been damages," said Banerjee.

"I am going to visit Meerik and collect reports then whatever aid is needed will be sent by the government," she added.

A part of a building in Siliguri had collapsed on Saturday.

The death toll from the devastating earthquake, which hit Nepal and northern parts of India on Saturday, climbed over 2,100 even as the rescue efforts intensified in search of survivors in the Himalayan nation's worst temblor in over 80 years.

Earlier in the day, a powerful 6.7-magnitude aftershock jolted Nepal and adjoining areas, triggering panic among the people.

The massive earthquake and the aftershocks left behind a trail of death and destruction in Nepal's capital Kathmandu.
