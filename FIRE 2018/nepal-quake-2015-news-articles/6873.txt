Nepali adventure tour operator Ace the Himalaya is offering a 13-day program that includes nine days of trekking and four rebuilding villages destroyed by the earthquake that rocked Nepal late last month.

The tours will help rebuild villages in the hard-hit Gorkha region, near the epicenter of the first earthquake, where trekking volunteers will provide “priceless sweat equity along with much needed dollars the help purchase construction supplies”, Ace said.

Ace partnered with Portland, Oregon based The Clymb — an e-commerce business that sells outdoor gear, apparel and adventure travel trips — to organize the trips. There are eight departures beginning in September and running through May 2016.

The rate of $1,199 per person includes transportation, accommodations, meals and guides. All of the trip proceeds will go to the Sambhav Nepal Foundation, a local organization that is rebuilding villages.
