The United Family and its customers raised $60,0000 to help cover the shipping cost of a food container being sent to vicitims of the Nepal earthquake. Ted Holder, Breeflove Foods, Inc. CEO, said the container of food can feed about 23,000 families.

Robert Taylor, United Family president, presented a $60,000 to Breedlove Foods, Inc. to help cover the shipping cost of a food container the nonprofit is sending to Nepal that will offer 1.5 million servings of food to the Nepal earthquake victims.

Ted Holder, Breedlove Foods, Inc. CEO, was presented a $60,000 check from Robert Taylor, United Family president, for the nonprofit's Nepal earthquake relief effort. The $60,000 will cover the shipping cost to deliver a contanier of food to the victims of the Nepal earthquake that happened in April.

In just eight days, United Family stores’ customers helped raise $45,000 to help send food to victims in the Nepal earthquake disaster.

On Wednesday, Robert Taylor, United president, presented a $60,000 check to Ted Holder, Breedlove Foods, Inc. CEO, that will cover the shipping cost to get a food container to Nepal.

Taylor said the United Family donated $15,000 along with the $45,000 its customers raised.

“We knew there was a big need in Nepal,” Taylor said. “We’re fortunate in this part of the country to have Breedlove dehydration plant that can dehydrate food and you can get so much more over to a place in need when it’s dehydrated. We put it out there for one week to our guests and our guests responded wonderfully.”

The magnitude-7.8 earthquake in April left more than 8,000 dead, which prompted the Lubbock nonprofit to organize a relief effort.

“As soon as we heard about the tragedy in Nepal we reached out to a partner that we have that was on the ground (in Nepal),” Holder said. “We said we will put together a container of food and donate it to them. United stepped up and wanted to be a part of it. This is the first collaboration that we’ve had with them and it’s worked out beautifully.”

With United’s help, Breedlove Food will be able to provide about 1.5 million servings of food and feed more than 23,000 families in Nepal.

“We’re raising money to help them, so 100 percent of that goes to the people and that’s what you look for,” Taylor said. “You look for people helping people.”

Taylor said United customers were made aware of the Nepal relief program at store registers when they would check out. He said the outpouring of support is impressive.

“It was a great response,” he said. “Our team members responded well. They had almost no notice to set this up. The big thing was our guests in all of our areas they responded very well and quickly. We knew with that type of response it was a high priority on our guest’s list to take care of those people.”
