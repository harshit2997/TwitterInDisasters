Few stories from Nepal are more dramatic than that of a young woman from Sindhupalchok, one of the worst-hit of all the districts.

Rita Maya Shrestra is 26 years old and was six and a half months pregnant on the day of the Great Quake, as they call it in Nepal.

She was in her house in the village of Hagam when the earthquake struck on April 24th.

Her home collapsed on top of her, trapping her in the ruins. She was severely injured and in terrible pain. It took three hours for her family to dig her out.

Rita had smashed one of her hips and broken a leg, the other was badly sprained.

She was in agony but she had a much longer wait ahead of herâ€¦ it was six days before Rita finally got medical help.

Rita spoke to BBC News at the Red Cross hospital in Chautara in Sindhupalchok.
