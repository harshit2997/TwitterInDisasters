Dylan Sartor is saving lives in Nepal.

The 19-year-old Newmarket resident is in the Nepalese town of Lukla, helping people devastated by the magnitude 7.8 earthquake that hit the Asian country a few days ago.

Dylan was about 4,000 metres up Mount Everest on his way to base camp at the time of the quake.

He’s currently trapped in the country and has decided to make the best of it and offer aid where possible, Dylan’s father Raymond told The Era Wednesday.

“He’s trying to help with the devastation that’s in that region,” Raymond said, who expressed concern for the teenager’s safety. “I don’t talk to him much; he just gives me little snippets. He’s in Nepal where the world is still shaking and the disease is mounting.

“He’s going to try to work his way to Kathmandu. He’s still not home, so he’s not safe.”

The earthquake triggered an avalanche that swept through the Mount Everest base camp, injuring and killing a number of people. Several news agencies are reporting the death toll from the earthquake has topped 5,000 and many of the people remaining are choosing to leave their homes for fear of collapse. They can be seen begging aid workers for food and shelter.

The earthquake affected an estimated eight million Nepalese, with 1.4 million needing immediate food assistance.

“You can’t get on the little shuttle planes because they are stuffed full of dead bodies in plastic bags,” Raymond said. “They’re just getting the dead bodies out of there. It’s pretty bad.”

Dylan had just finished his third year at Uppsala University in Sweden, where he was studying for the year. Before heading home, he decided to spend three weeks doing volunteer work in Kathmandu. At the end of his trip, he decided to venture up Mount Everest.
