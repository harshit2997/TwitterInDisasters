Warrnambool couple’s quake torment
</headline>

<text>
For Nikita Pokharel seeing the devastation in Nepal is like losing her identity.

Helping: Nikita Pokharel and her husband Deetesh Baskota.

Ms Pokharel and her husband Deetesh Baskota moved to Australia eight years ago and made their home in Warrnambool in 2013.

The couple married in Nepal last year and want to do all they can for their home country.

Since the 7.8 magnitude quake on April 25 Ms Pokharel said she’d been lucky to have a two-minute conversation with her family.

“My husband’s village, Dhading, has been swept away,” Ms Pokharel said. “There are a few family members at risk.”

She said her immediate family lived in Kathmandu, and her extended family was scattered throughout Nepal.

Ms Pokharel said as difficult as it was to watch the unfolding on the news, she believed she could do more good in Australia.

“It’s pretty chaotic there at the moment,” she said.

“I was told rescue crews are stuck at the airport. They don’t have food and water. I think I can do more good here.”

Ms Pokharel said the earthquake happened about 11am local time but it wasn’t until 5pm Australian time that she heard of the disaster. It wasn’t until 8.30pm that she got confirmation her family was safe and well.

Her family had been sleeping rough since the quake and remained in tents because they were too frightened go inside.

Fairfax has reported the United Nations launched an appeal for $US415 million ($A518 million) in aid from the international community, while President Barack Obama vowed the United States would do everything in its power to help.

Ms Pokharel said she and Mr Baskota were keen to meet any other Nepalese living in the south-west.

The couple has set up donation tins around Warrnambool at MI Fellowship, Lady Bay Resort and the Uniting Church. Dominos Pizza will donate $1 for every pizza bought on May 17.

Donations can also be made to the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies at www.ifrc.org/nepal-earthquake or the Non Residents Nepali Association at www.nrn.org.au/appeals/NEQ2015/
