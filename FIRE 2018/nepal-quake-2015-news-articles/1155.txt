FAIRFIELD, Conn., April 26, 2015 /PRNewswire-USNewswire/ -- The death toll after Saturday's earthquake continues to raise overnight in Nepal.

The count is now over 1,800 people killed and 4,700 injured. Save the Children is concerned that the death toll is likely to continue rising, as the day progresses and information from some of the affected districts become available.

"Shelter assistance is urgently needed. Many families have their houses destroyed or damaged and have to stay outside. Nights are cold," says Roger Hodgson, Deputy Country Director for Save the Children in Nepal.

"We also need to provide clean water urgently. Access to clean water is a recurrent problem in many parts of Nepal, even in normal time," adds Hodgson.

"We are particularly concerned by the situation in some of the most affected districts outside of the Kathmandu Valley. Information coming from these districts is still limited. We are sending assessment teams to these areas," Hodgson says.

Save the Children has some emergency kits, hygiene materials and tarpaulins already in Nepal and ready for distribution. "We hope to start distribution to the affected families as soon as possible.

"The earthquake and aftershocks are an important source of stress for the survivors, and particularly for children. Psychological support for children and their families should rapidly be established," Hodgson added.
