Canadians weigh in on devastation in Nepal
</headline>

<text>
Faye Kennedy, a 32-year-old civil servant from Ottawa, was trekking in Langtang National Park, some 65 kilometres north of Kathmandu, with a friend and local Sherpa when the earthquake struck. Their plan had been to hike through Langtang before flying to Tibet. Ms. Kennedy's family is now encouraging Canadians to donate to rescue efforts and aiming to raise awareness of the situation in Langtang.

Vancouver student Aedan Magee Mahon, 20, is in Nepal with a U.S.-based adventure travel group for students. Shortly after the earthquake hit, program staff notified parents that all the students were okay. Mr. Magee Mahon's father, Michael, said his son is safe and out of harm's way, though worried about the family in Kathmandu he had stayed with for weeks. "We're just really fortunate that they were beginning a multiday trek, so they had food and water and tents and everything that you need in an emergency," said the father, chief of staff for Vancouver Mayor Gregor Robertson.

Late Sunday night, former New Brunswick NDP leader Elizabeth Weir posted to Twitter: "Outside Kathmandu and still aftershocks with ground rumbling." The following evening, she tweeted again: "Sleeping outside for a second night because of possible quake. Inconvenient for us but this is life-shattering for so many Nepalis."
