Spokane Mercy Corps volunteers arrived in Nepal days before quake hit

SPOKANE, Wash. - George Wilson and his family arrived in Nepal less than two weeks ago to help farmers as part of Mercy Corps. Then the earthquake struck and the local family has found itself in the middle of a massive disaster relief mission.

It was a new chapter for the Wilson family as they moved from Lebanon to Nepal with Mercy Corps, a humanitarian group dedicated to ending poverty around the world. Depending on how you look at it, the Wilsons arrived in Nepal at the best or worst time.

"He was there nine days and the earthquake hit and so they were as surprised as anybody," George's dad, Lewis Wilson, said.

Lew Wilson said his son George, his wife and their two young children were trapped in a hotel room, fearing the worst.

"Hit pretty hard, scared them, hid in the doorway and huddled, then they ran for the outside," Wilson said.

They made it out safely and now they're working to help other survivors.

"They're transitioning into rescue and relief more immediately than his project," Wilson said.

It's no easy task, with unsanitary living conditions and only a few flights coming in and out of the airport.

"Nepal now is entering maybe the more dangerous period, that's rescue and getting food and supplies in," Wilson said.

Wilson said his family is worried about George and his family constantly; his son and his family are sleeping under a tarp out in the elements right now, but knows he's pursuing his dream of helping others who can't help themselves.

"It's our own fault for raising children that are interested in peace and justice around the world and he's living it. This is what we get," Wilson chuckled.
