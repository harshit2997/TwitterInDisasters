Water Missions International Responds to Nepal Earthquake
</headline>

<text>
Water Missions International is currently responding to meet the urgent need for safe water in Nepal as a result of the massive earthquake and aftershocks impacting the region. The death toll continues to rise as rescue teams are reaching isolated communities outside of the capital of Kathmandu. There are inadequate food and water supplies, and the threat of cholera grows each day as a result of unsanitary living conditions.

Water Missions staff is working in collaboration with partners to respond to the urgent need for safe water as a result of the devastation. Water treatment equipment, including chlorination devices and five Living Water™ Treatment Systems (LWTS™), are being sent to Nepal. Each LWTS™ is capable of treating approximately 40,000 liters of water per day.

Because Water Missions has partners and staff located around the world we are able to rapidly respond to this disaster. Staff members from Charleston headquarters, Denmark, and Indonesia are traveling to Nepal to aid in relief efforts. Water treatment equipment is being sent as Water Missions works to provide safe water to people who are suffering. Please join us in these life saving efforts.
