New Delhi, May 11

The alleged Nepal head of terror group Indian Mujahideen and a close associate of one of its founders has been arrested by the Delhi police's special cell. The alleged terrorist, identified as Irfan Ahmad, is wanted in several cases and has links with the Lashkar-e-Toiba, claimed the police.

Ahmad was arrested from Bahraich (Uttar Pradesh). He was jailed for his involvement in a case under the Terrorist and Disruptive Activities (Prevention) Act or TADA and was later released on parole in 2001. He, however, jumped parole and was on the run since 2001.

Ahmad was again arrested in 2010 by the Nepal Police for an alleged attempt to obtain a new Nepalese citizenship on forged documents. After trial, he was sentenced to five-year imprisonment with his real identity still concealed even from the Nepalese authorities. He was lodged in Sindhupal Chowk jail "His sentence was to end in July this year. However, the jail wall collapsed in the massive quake on April 25 and he escaped. He reached Bahraich to avoid being arrested by the Nepal police, but was nabbed by our team," said SN Shrivastava, Special Commissioner of Police (Special Cell).

"His interrogation is likely to throw light on plans of the two terror groups. We hope to expose many sleeper cells and logistical hubs of these outfits in India and Nepal," he said.

Irfan had allegedly planted bombs in two Rajdhani trains which were passing through Kanpur Railway Station on December 5 and December 6, 1993, said the police. It was the year after the Babri mosque demolition.
