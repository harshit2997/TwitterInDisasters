AN Orange chef has spent the past few days gathering clothes, medicine and items to take to Nepal to help people affected by the earthquake on the weekend.

Sujan Rayamajhi has worked at Lolli Redini Restaurant since he moved to Orange from Sydney two years ago, and will arrive in Nepal on Monday night with items to distribute to those left without food or shelter.

He is also using donated money to buy food for people in Nepal and will travel to an isolated village that has been hit hard by the disaster.

He said he had four weeks off work and Lolli Redini owners Simonn Hawke and Leah Morphett had been very supportive and helpful in putting the call out for donations.

Ms Morphett said the response had been excellent with a Facebook request reaching 8000 people.

Originally from Nepal, Mr Rayamajhi has been living in Australia for the past seven years.

The earthquake has killed more than 5000 people and destroyed buildings in villages as well as the capital, Kathmandu, where his family live.

“They are fine, my sister lost her house and she is moving to my house [in Nepal],” Mr Rayamajhi said.

Although his family is safe, Mr Rayamajhi said a friend recently broke down to him and cried while pleading for help.

Media reports showing the damage and conditions also inspired him to help.

“They’ve got nothing to wear, no house to live in and because of this weather, it’s raining there, they even don’t have tents to make the roof. They are sleeping in the fields and on the ground,” Mr Rayamajhi said.

“After seeing that I thought I should do something for these people.”

In 2010 Mr Rayamajhi had his own experience of not knowing if he would have food or shelter after he lost his job in Australia

“I know the importance of food and the importance of a roof,” he said.

Mr Rayamajhi has had 20kg added to his luggage allowance and items he cannot fit will be taken by friends in their luggage.

Among those who answered the call for help was Peter Smith Chemmart.

Pharmacy owner/ manager Tim Gray donated about $500 worth of hygiene and medical supplies, including toothbrushes, toothpaste, rehydration salts, diarrhoea tablets and paracetamol tablets.

If anyone wants to help they can phone Lolli Redini Restaurant on 6361 7748 or Mr Rayamajhi on 0450 700 554.
