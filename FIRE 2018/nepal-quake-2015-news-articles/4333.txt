Bengaluru: "I am on my way to Kathmandu and I am eager to help people." says, 34-year-old Dr. Guruprasad C, Assistant Professor, Department of Psychiatry, Bangalore Medical College and Research Institute (BMCRI).

He has voluntarily decided to help those in distress post the Nepal earthquake which claimed more than 5000 lives. The city-based doctor contacted 'Nayati Charitable Trust', a Delhi-based trust which had set up various medical camps and services that had proved life-saving for hundreds in difficult terrains."I was informed about this camp through friends. I have a team of thirty people including doctors, pharmacists and volunteers. We will reach Kathmandu, by Thursday evening." said, Dr. Guruprasad. Speaking about the situation, the doctor says he is ready to face all challenges thrown at him.

"We have a plan of action set out and we are very positive about the outcome. A few from the team have worked during the Gujarat earthquake and the Uttarakhand crisis so there are experienced people along with me. We have to first asses the ground situation and decide our plan of action. We are ready for emergency measures like infection control and shock and post traumatic stress due to electro-magnetic disturbances." He plans to first heal people of their physical afflictions and then progress to heal them mentally.

"An epidemic may have spread as there are many dead bodies.” adds Dr. Guruprasad. He is on a minimum of fifteen days leave which might extend to thirty days. “My wife has been very supportive of my decision. She wanted to come along with me and has been very positive and encouraging," sums up Dr. Guruprasad. His wife, Dr. Chinmayee J, an ophthalmologist and assistant professor at Minto Eye Hospital says, that she is very proud about her husband’s mission to heal.
