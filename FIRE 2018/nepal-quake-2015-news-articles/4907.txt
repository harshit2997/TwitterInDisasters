VANCOUVER, Wash.â€” A Vancouver man who survived the devastating earthquake in Nepal has made it back home to his family.

Carl LaCasse flew in early Sunday morning to Portland and spent his first day at home barbecuing with his wife, children and grandchildren.

LaCasse volunteers several times a year, traveling the world with non-profits as a photojournalist. He flew into Nepal the day the earthquake struck.

"I will never forget the sound and the feeling or what I heard in the earth and how it was shifting," LaCasse said.

He survived the earthquake without injuries, and made the long trip back home a week later.

This is not LaCasse's first brush with death. Last fall, he suffered a near fatal heart attack. He was supposed to take the trip to Nepal then, but had to reschedule.

"I had to prove to myself I could go on these trips still and give back," he said.

LaCasse said he feels that he was meant to be in Nepal during the earthquake for a reason.

"Why was I supposed to be in Nepal in that moment?," he said. "Maybe this is it, to show the true passion and the story behind what has happened there."

LaCasse's wife, Tami, is overjoyed to have her husband back home.

"I just love him with all my heart, I'm so proud of him," she said.

She knows her husband will someday travel overseas again, and she's coming to terms with it.

"I don't think I can take his passion away, he loves doing photojournalism and loves bringing awareness to different things around the world. Hopefully he'll wait a very long time this time!"
