LYNN Wright is hopeful her daughter will soon be on a flight out of Nepal after what has been the “most stressful week of her life.”

Teegan Wright, 21, was three hours from finishing her trek in Lukla when the 7.9 magnitude earthquake hit on Saturday.

“They basically had to run the rest of the way because they were worried about avalanches,” Ms Wright said.

It’s the sixth day Teegan has been stranded in Lukla, a town situated at 2,800m above sea level popular among visitors to Mount Everest.

In a statement on its website on Wednesday, DFAT said domestic airports in Nepal were operational, however flights were being delayed or cancelled due to weather, congestion, and prioritising aid flights and rescue helicopters.

Ms Wright said her daughter has had flights booked every day since Sunday, but was hopeful that Thursday would be “the day.”

“There’s a fair bit of aid coming from other people. I’m hopeful she’ll be on a flight out of Lukla by the end of the day,” she said.

Ms Wright said while contact with her daughter was sporadic over Wi-Fi, she was grateful for the brief contact.

“Teegan only called us for 30 seconds to say, “I’m alive, I’m safe, I’ll call you when I can.”

“I can’t even imagine what it’s like for other parents who haven’t heard from their kids,” Ms Wright said.

Three WA teenagers missing in Nepal made contact with their families on Tuesday night confirming they were alive and well.

The death toll from the quake has risen to 5,489 people, according to a recent update from the National Emergency Operation Centre.
