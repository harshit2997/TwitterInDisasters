Preparing for an intercontinental relief trip is no easy task. Dr. Richard Paat and a team of more than a dozen doctors, nurses and medical personnel will travel to Nepal Tuesday to provide aid and relief to the country devastated by an earthquake.





Niraj Gupta is the president of the Nepalese Student Association at the University of Toledo; we first met him last week at a candlelight vigil for the victims in his native Nepal.





"I feel helpless," he said last week. "I need to do something but I cannot do anything except offer my prayers."





Dr. Paat read that quote online and he knew he could help Niraj help his country. So he invited him to a packing party where the group filled more than two dozen bags, stuffed with pharmaceuticals and medical equipment for the trip.





"I reached out to them and they came by the -- the entire group came over to help. It was very touching," said Paat.





"I'm very excited they're going there to add some help (for) the people," said Gupta on Sunday.





Gupta won't be traveling with the group, but he was proud to help them prepare for their mission. He couldn't help but to smile when thinking about the collaborative effort. "I'm very happy to see the Toledo community banding together to do something for our country."





"We've really made some nice friendships here," said Paat. "We'll come back and share stories and hopefully visit their country at a better time."
