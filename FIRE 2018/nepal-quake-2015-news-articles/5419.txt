A fundraising day in Wirral for survivors of the Nepal earthquake will be close to the heart of organisers.

Nepalese-born Keshav Magar, who works as a sous chef at Claremont Farm in Bebington, has many friends and family whose lives have been severely affected by last month’s devastating earthquake.

Keshav moved to the UK three years ago after marrying Wirral-born Philippa Smith, who he met while she was working as a volunteer in Nepal.

The pair are the driving force behind the fundraising day for the Nepal earthquake DEC appeal, which takes place at Claremont Farm this weekend.

Keshav grew up on his family farm in Khotang, a far Eastern district of Nepal, and about a two-day walk from Mount Everest.

He said: “My family live in a remote area and it’s taken a long time for aid to reach them.”

Philippa said: “Nepal is Keshav’s homeland and therefore we have many friends and family affected by the recent earthquake. It’s really tough for people there.

“They are waiting for shelter, food, water and medical aid. Communications are down and the situation is more and more worrying by the day.

“As we can’t be there in person, we wanted to do what we could to support those who are there on the ground.”

Claremont Farm, as well as employing Keshav, hosts the Nepalese cooking classes he runs with his wife.

The farm’s director, Andrew Pimbley, has also visited the country many times and is just as keen to do his bit.

The death toll from the 7.8-magnitude quake, Nepal’s worst in more than 80 years, has so far reached more than 7,300.

The fundraising event currently has a wide variety of events and stalls planned, including Nepalese food, dancers, and music. It takes place on Sunday, May 10, from 12 noon to 3pm. Entry is free.
