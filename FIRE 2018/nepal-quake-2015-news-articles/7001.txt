NORMAL – A 7.8 magnitude earthquake struck Nepal on April 25 and a candlelight vigil was held Wednesday at Uptown Circle by members of the Nepalese community in Bloomington-Normal to honor the victims.

Deepak Sharma, an organizer of the vigil, said the small group of Nepalese people in Bloomington-Normal have heavy hearts.

“This (vigil) is more about sending our love and prayers to the people of Nepal,” Sharma said.

Around 8,000 people died last month and another few dozen people died in a 7.3 magnitude earthquake Tuesday. Govinda Bhandari said they’re doing what they can here to help.

“Here in Bloomington-Normal, we are trying to work with the local community and then bring some solidarity for Nepal,” Bhandari said. “(We’re trying) to raise awareness and some money for the people back home.”

You can find more about the local relief effort by visiting the Nepalese Association of Bloomington Illinois Facebook page. Other organizations, such as UNICEF and the Red Cross, are coordinating larger relief efforts.
