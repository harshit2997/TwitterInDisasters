All Kashmiris working in Kathmandu, the capital of earthquake-hit Nepal, are safe, a police spokesman said.



"As per the information available, there has been no casualty (death) among the Kashmiris in Kathmandu due to the earthquake," a police spokesman said.



He said, however, two persons -- identified by their first names only as Omar and Sajad -- have sustained injuries in the 7.9 magnitude tremor that has left over 1900 persons dead."Both the injured are undergoing treatment at Teaching Hospital in Kathmandu and are out of danger," the spokesman said.Several families here had expressed concern about the fate of their loved ones in Nepal as they were not able to get in touch with them due to disruption in telecommunication services in the earthquake-hit Himalayan country.The spokesman said the Police Control Room Srinagar is in constant touch with the Ministry of External Affairs Control Room in Delhi and the Control Room in Kathmandu."Government of India has made elaborate arrangements to evacuate the stranded people from Nepal. All the stranded persons have been asked to contact Wing Commander Ravi Sharma at Kathmandu airport for evacuation," he added.
