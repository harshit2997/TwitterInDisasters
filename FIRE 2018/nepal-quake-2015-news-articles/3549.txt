BRANFORD -- More than 100 members of Connecticut's Nepalese community gathered for a vigil on Tuesday night to mourn those lost and injured in Saturday's earthquake overseas.

Most not only know, but also share blood with someone currently at the center of the devastation in Nepal.

For Pranavi Limbu, that someone is her grandma. "She's old and she really needs help and the whole entire Nepal, the country needs help," said the nine-year-old.

The group at the vigil sang songs and held a moment of silence together on the steps of Branford Town Hall. A Hindu priest led the ceremony.

Some adults in the crowd prayed for help from their Connecticut neighbors.

"I actually request the medical personnel like doctors, nurses, please come forward to go to Nepal as a volunteer," said Ram Shrestha, an organizer of a quake relief fund.

Nisha Rana , a physician's assistant whose mother, cousin and best friend are in Nepal, said surgeons are especially are in need, as well as those who practice general medicine. "Immediate urgent care stuff so like cuts and bruises and trying to get to those broken bones, I think those are the most needed right now," she said.

Leaders from the Branford chapter of the Society of Nepalese in America, the organization that put together the vigil, said they would accompany the medical experts with help from money raised. They need to go sooner rather than later said Shrestha. About 9,000 people have been reported as injured and health concerns are piling up, including a lack of food and fresh water.

Pranavi said Nepalese here and abroad can't fix the situation alone. "They really need it because their houses are broken and my family and other families where too really, really are trying," the middle-schooler said.
