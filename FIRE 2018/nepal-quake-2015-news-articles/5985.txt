Three doctors from Mysuru have decided to do their bit for the earthquake victims in Nepal. While Manjunath B.H., an orthopedician and the State convenor of the BJP medical cell, has already reached Kathmandu, two other doctors — Shyam Sarvodey, a paediatrician and Sushma Krishnamurthy — will leave for Nepal on Friday.

“The moment I saw the pictures of quake-hit Nepal on the TV, the first thing that came to my mind is to pack my bags and go to Nepal to serve people who are in need of urgent medical help,” said Sushma Krishnamurthy, Junior Consultant, Department of General Surgery, Holdsworth Memorial Mission Hospital, Mysuru. Dr. Manjunath reached Kathmandu on Thursday.

Dr. Sushma and Dr. Shyam are carrying around 20 cartons of medical supplies and plan to help authorities of Chirayu National Hospital reach out to quake victims. “My hospital gave medicines worth Rs. 25,000. Dr. S.N. Mothi and many entrepreneurs supported our gesture,” Dr. Sushma said.

Dr Shyam, who runs Kid Care Clinic in Mysuru, said:“We have taken a one-way ticket to Kathmandu. I have not set any time frame for myself and am going to stay there for quite some time to lend medical support. After we return, another team will go there. The Nepalese hospital had told us to take care of our stay.”
