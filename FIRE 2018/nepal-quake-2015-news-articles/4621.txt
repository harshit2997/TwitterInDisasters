This is the first time the country's armed police have ventured beyond its borders.The first batch of 160 "armed police officers" crossed the Friendship Bridge that links the two countries on May 2. A total of 500 police officers and 180 pieces of road repair machinery will be sent, according to Fu Ling, a senior officer with the traffic rescue brigade of the police.The visiting policemen were received by the Nepalese police at the border, the official Xinhua news agency said. China has also sent geologists to Nepal to assist in the rescue operation.This is a significant move, which was approved by the State Council, which is the cabinet, and the Central Military Commission.
