Assuring all possible help to neighbouring Nepal, President Pranab Mukherjee today said India strongly feels for Nepalese people and hopes that the situation there will soon return to normalcy.



The President conveyed this to Deep Kumar Upadhyay, who had come to Rashtrapati Bhavan to present his credentials as the new Nepalese Ambassador to India.



The devastating earthquake has uprooted the life of a large number of people with huge casualties and tremendous suffering, Mukherjee said, and recalled his conversation with Nepalese counterpart Ram Baran Yadav and assured that India will do whatever possible to assist its neighbour, with whom it has had close relations for centuries.



The President said Indians are with the people of Nepal in this hour of distress. "They feel strongly for their brothers and sisters who have been affected by this tragedy. India hopes the situation will soon return to normalcy," he said.



Nepalese envoy said his country is struggling to come to terms with the devastation caused by the earthquake.



"The support and sympathy of the government and people of India is a great source of strength for Nepal. Nepal is grateful for the swift action by the Government of India," he was quoted in an official release as saying.
