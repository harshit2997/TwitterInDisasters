The death toll from Saturday's earthquake could be as high as 15,000 people, according to Nepal's army chief.

Currently, the official death toll from the 7.8-magnitude earthquake stands at 5,800.

"Our estimates are not looking good. We are thinking that 10,000 to 15,000 may be killed," Gen. Gaurav Rana said.

Rana, who is leading nation's the rescue mission nationwide, said Nepal's officials are struggling to deal with the aftermath.

"There is unrest, and we are watching it. Yes, there is the threat of an epidemic, and we are watching it," he said.

Hundreds of Nepalis protested Wednesday outside parliament, angry with the government's response to its search and rescue effort.

Rana stressed the army is working with police to "identify local hot spots and control things [politically]."
