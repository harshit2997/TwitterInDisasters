UN Humanitarian Chief Announces $15 Mln Emergency Fund For Nepal
</headline>

<text>
In response to severe devastation caused by the 7.8 magnitude earthquake and many strong aftershocks that have hit Nepal, the United Nations Emergency Relief Coordinator Tuesday released $15 million through the Central Emergency Response Fund (CERF) to enable humanitarian aid organizations to rapidly scale up operations and provide immediate assistance to people in desperate need.

"With the death toll rising and millions of people affected, it's a race against time as humanitarian agencies work around the clock to reach people and communities," said Valerie Amos, who is also Under-Secretary-General for Humanitarian Affairs. "This allocation from CERF means that critical life-saving work can be scaled up immediately."

A statement released by the Spokesperson for the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs said that the funding, which would not be possible without the generous support of CERF's donors, will enable recipient humanitarian agencies working with partners to prioritize the most immediate needs, including logistics, shelter, water and .

It is estimated that nearly 4000 people have been killed and over 6,000 injured in Nepal and neighboring countries since the earthquake hit on Saturday and aid workers expect those numbers to rise as they access remote areas closer to the quake's epicenter.

With a total of 39 districts affected by the earthquake, eight million people have been affected, including two million in the 11 most severely affected districts.

More information on the $15 million funding injection will become available in the coming days, the OCHA statement said, adding that the money will boost immediate assistance to people in need. Additional resources will be vital to supporting and sustaining aid efforts in the coming months.

A Spokesperson for the Office of the United Nations High Commission for Refugees announced that an airlift relief supplies will arrive in Kathmandu Tuesday from their warehouse in Dubai, supplementing aid already deployed.
