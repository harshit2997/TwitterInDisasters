China will provide a second batch of humanitarian aid -- worth 40 million yuan -- to Nepal, following its first batch on Sunday.

China's Ministry of Commerce said the aid will include water purification equipment, first-aid kits, tents and blankets. The MOC also announced joint efforts with the Ministry of Finance to provide meat -- normally held in reserve by the government for food security -- for the markets in the Tibet autonomous region, which was also affected by Saturday's earthquake.

The supply will include 100 tons of yak meat and as many tons of pork.
