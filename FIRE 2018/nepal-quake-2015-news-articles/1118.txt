Gripping images coming out of the Asian country show only a fraction of the damage that massive earthquake left after rocking the country of Nepal.While many now sift through rubble and debris a half a world away, back here in the Metro Richmond area members of the Chester Christian Church are breathing a sigh of relief."As soon as it happened they were able to communicate with me to let me know they were safe, and they reached out to their families and we were able to reach out to their families and the rest of the church," John Bukoffskey said.Four members of the Chesterfield Church left Thursday for a mission trip in the Asian country, just 30 minutes after they landed at the airport, disaster would follow.Church Mission Leader John Bukoffskey had planned on traveling with the group but things didn't pan out.Since the quake, he has been in constant contact."They were rushed out of the airport. Their luggage is still at the airport and they are at the hotel, they are safe but they are being rushed in and out of the hotel as the tremors happen also," Bukoffskey said.Aaron Hoback, pastor of Chester Christian Church, is thankful that all four team members of the mission group are okay."At first it was relief but then it was heartbreak for the folks over in Nepal, people who are going through this, families just going through this devastation," Aaron Hoback said.Pastor Hoback says the church typically plans one or two mission trips a year. Their group had planned to meet up with others from a Nebraska Church."They were supposed to be leaving Kathmandu about two hours after they arrived to go out into a village area to build a internet cafe/ training center," Bukoffskey said.Both Pastor Hoback and John Bukoffskey say those plans may change now with thousands in need of helping hands."They were supposed to go earlier in the month and that date change and so they are there for a reason, a purpose and God has a plan for them," Hoback said.
