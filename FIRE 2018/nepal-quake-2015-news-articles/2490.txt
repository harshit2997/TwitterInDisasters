THE Armed Forces of the Philippines said on Monday that it is ready to send emergency aid to Nepal to help with disaster relief mission.

“In case we are ordered by our commander-in-chief, we are ready to send a delegation to Nepal to help them in humanitarian relief operations,” AFP chief General Gregorio Catapang Jr. told reporters at Camp Aguinaldo when asked if the Philippines would send aid to Nepal, which was hit by a magnitude 7.8 earthquake last Saturday.

Catapang said the number of personnel would depend on the request of the Nepalese government.

“Maybe we can send as much as one platoon for humanitarian assistance and disaster relief,” he said.

A platoon consists of about 40 soldiers.

Officials said at least 2,500 people were known to have died in the deadly quake, which destroyed large parts of Nepal and also triggered a deadly avalanche that swept through Mt. Everest base camp. It is said to be country’s worst disaster in 80 years. AC
