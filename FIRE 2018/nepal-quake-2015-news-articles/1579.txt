Himachal Pradesh will soon have a disaster management battalion which will rescue people in distress. This was stated by Rajinder Singh Rana, Vice-Chairman of the state Disaster Management Board ,while addressing a press conference here today. He said rapid action disaster management teams had been formed in all districts of the state and 30 troops of Home Guards were trained in each district to meet disaster preparedness. “All Deputy Commissioners in the state have been asked to make arrangements for disaster preparedness,” he said. He said the Police Department, Fire Department and Disaster Management Board were organising training camps in schools and colleges regularly to teach students about drills to be performed in case of calamities. The government had decided to train the youth and members of panchayats and block development committees for disaster management, so that they could help in times of distress, he said. He said volunteers of the National Service Scheme (NSS) and cadets of the National Cadet Core (NCC) were being trained to meet the challenges posed by disasters. “The earthquake in Nepal has raised the concern of people around the world for pre-disaster preparedness,” he added.
