Nepal's prime minister: 'We were not prepared' for 2nd quake

CHARIKOT (Nepal) â€” Nepal has been overwhelmed by its second massive earthquake in less than three weeks, its prime minister said today (May 14) as he visited this normally placid foothills town, now a centre for frightened villagers desperate for government help.

Thousands of people now crowd the streets of Charikot, the administrative centre of the isolated district hit hardest by Tuesday's magnitude-7.3 quake, which killed at least 96 people and injured more than 2,300. The magnitude-7.8 earthquake that hit April 25 killed more than 8,150 people, injured tens of thousands more and left hundreds of thousands homeless.

"After the first quake, we were not prepared for a second one so big," Prime Minister Sushil Koirala told reporters after arriving in Charikot by helicopter.

He said the coming monsoon rains now loomed large, with hundreds of thousands of people left homeless.

"We need tents. Our people need shelter. With the rainy season, it will be difficult for people to survive in the open," he said.

Nearly everyone is too afraid to sleep indoors in Charikot, which is filling with people from surrounding areas seeking help. Dozens of smaller aftershocks terrorize the country.

While there have been occasional food handouts here, there was nowhere near enough supplies distributed for the people who kept arriving. Many people simply waited at the locked gates of the army's small aid distribution centre, shaking the fence angrily when their frustration got the better of them.

"We came here with such hopes and such difficulty, but now we're just waiting and waiting," said Mr Navraj Nama, 25, who came to Charikot with his brother and elderly uncle after the second earthquake. He said 90 per cent of their home village, Danda Khorka, had been damaged in the April 25 quake, and about 50 buildings had collapsed when the second one hit.

Mr Nama's village is among those in desperate need of shelter, and the young farmer came here hoping to get tents or tarpaulins to carry back with him. But none were available.

There is also a shortage of tarps and tents in the Nepalese capital, Kathmandu, with some people even using cardboard boxes as temporary shelters.
