‘I’m sure he’s fine’: Sheridan family hopeful brother will be found alive following devastating Nepal earthquake
</headline>

The sister of a young Australian man missing in the wake of the deadly Nepal earthquake said recent news from the scene indicates he is safe and well.

Adelaide man Zachary Sheridan, 20, has not contacted his family since the devastating 7.9 magnitude quake struck but his sister, Zoe, said her brother’s last known location appeared to have been spared from the worst of the damage.

“Where we think Zachary is, a town called Gokyo [has] resisted the earthquake and everyone there is safe,” she told Lisa Wilkinson on TODAY.

Zachary’s brother, actor Hugh Sheridan, left for Nepal yesterday to help the search.

“We haven’t actually heard from him but a group of French people there [passed on the message],” Ms Sheridan said.

Mr Sheridan had been studying media and arts in Hong Kong when he decided to embark on the trip on his own.

He had been travelling with a local trekking tour company.

Ms Sheridan said the family was aware phone and internet service in the region was notoriously poor.

“The contact there is so bad,” she said.

“Even before the earthquake, the last time we spoke to Zachary he said, ‘the Wi-Fi is woeful’.

“I feel really positive that he’s ok. I’m sure he’s fine, safe and warm.”

The death toll from the earthquake has surpassed 4100, with more victims believed buried under rubble across the stricken country.

One Australian, Melbourne mother-of-two Renu Fotedar, is confirmed to have died after she was caught in an avalanche at Mount Everest base camp.
