Chicago climber OK after Mount Everest avalanche, Nepal earthquake
</headline>

The Chicago family of a 64-year-old Chicago Fire Department retiree set to climb Mount Everest was happy to hear that he was unhurt following the devastating earthquake that hit Nepal on Saturday.

Ramona Stirbu said her uncle Viorel "Wally" Stirbu told her Monday afternoon that he was having lunch in base camp when the earthquake hit.

"They went outside to see what was going on, and they could see dust and rocks and big stones and snow coming," Ramona Stirbu said. "He said it was like a tsunami. They went back into the tent to avoid the dust. Then they went out to see what happened and what damage was done."

The avalanche, she said, "was far away from their camp, so they were not really in danger."

A State Department spokesman said Monday that at least four Americans have died in Nepal's earthquake, all at Mount Everest base camp.

Ramona Stirbu said her uncle subsequently flew to Kathmandu by helicopter and is awaiting an available flight to return to Chicago.

"He's OK," Vasile Stirbu, the climber's brother, said Monday. "He's great now. Nothing wrong."

Wally Stirbu, a member of the Lincoln Park Boat Club, planned to climb Mount Everest to complete the Seven Summits Challenge, which involves climbing each continent's highest peak. My Chicago Athlete Magazine reported in February that Stirbu had begun the challenge in 2012 and most recently had returned from scaling Mount Vinson in Antarctica.
