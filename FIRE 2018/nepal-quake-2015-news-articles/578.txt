Foreign Minister Datuk Seri Anifah AmanKUALA LUMPUR: Malaysia is ready to extend its assistance to Nepal that was rocked by a 7.8 magnitude earthquake today.

Foreign Minister Datuk Seri Anifah Aman told reporters tonight that there was no access to enter Nepal as the Tribhuvan International airport in Kathmandu was closed for now.

"Of course we will help Nepal that goes without saying. "When the airport is re-opened, we can go in," he said after the joint welcoming dinner for Asean foreign ministers which Deputy Prime Minister Tan Sri Muhyiddin Yassin attended.

The earthquake that rocked the capital Kathmandu and Pokhara city at 2.54pm (Malaysian time) was believed to have been killed more than 800 people especially when the tremor triggered a massive avalanche on Mount Everest.

All Malaysians including a team of climbers from Universiti Teknologi Malaysia (UTM) on Mount Everest were reported to be in safe condition.

Wisma Putra in a statement said upon receiving a preliminary report from the Malaysia embassy in Katmandu, the Malaysian High Commission in New Delhi contacted all Malaysians registered under the ministry.
