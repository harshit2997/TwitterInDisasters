Philippine president says ASEAN to extend "collective" assistance to Nepal - Xinhua
</headline>

<text>
MANILA, April 28 (Xinhua) -- Philippine president said Tuesday that ASEAN countries have agreed to extend "collective" assistance to Nepal, instead of doing it one by one.

Benigno S. Aquino III made the remark when he arrived in Manila Tuesday afternoon from Malaysia where he attended the Southeast Asian regional summit.

Aquino described his attendance at the 26th Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) Summit as "more meaningful" because this is the target year for the ASEAN Community -- an integration of the 10-member countries in Southeast Asia.

Nepal was struck by 7.9-magnitude earthquake Saturday, which has killed 4,555 and more that 8,000 injured.
