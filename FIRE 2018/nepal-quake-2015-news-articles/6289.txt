Mac Stewart says he'd like to return to help

The magnitude 7.8 earthquake that killed thousands and caused widespread destruction in Nepal also cut short one upstate nurse's efforts to help the country.

Mac Stewart, a Peace Corps trainee, was shopping in the outdoor markets of Thamel Square, a tourist district, when it happened on April 25.

"The ground started shaking and we were, like, 'What is this?'" Stewart said. "It was just a lot of panic -- people running and trying to get to a safe area."

Stewart said he and the other trainees reunited with the Peace Corps staff, and all of them found refuge on the property of Nepal's vice president before relocating to the U.S. Embassy.

A week and a half later, Stewart was back at home with his parents and brother.

"I was very relieved to be able to come home and see my family and friends because it's a difficult," Stewart told WYFF. "It definitely makes it easier when you're with the ones you love."

Stewart said said he also felt a sense of sadness because he could not stay to help.

"Before the earthquake it was already a difficult place to live and make do it because of the terrain," Stewart said. "Nepal was in a state of...political instability as well because they had just had the Maoist rebellion."

Stewart said he was overcome with another wave of deep sadness when Tuesday's magnitude 7.3 earthquake hit Nepal.

He said he was also somewhat shocked to learn about the missing military helicopter from the U.S.

"It's a little surprising because it's the U.S. Marines that are missing," Stewart said. "But with the terrain, the lack of resources -- and some of the places are so remote -- it's easy to get lost or have something unfortunate happen to you in Nepal."

Stewart said he is still waiting to hear how the devastation will ultimately affect his Peace Corps assignment but would still like to return someday.

"I'm just hoping that we'd be able to support Nepal in this difficult time for them," Stewart said. "We're so fortunate here in the United States. There are other parts of the world that are hurting right now, and Nepal is definitely, definitely hurting right now."
