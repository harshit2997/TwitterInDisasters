Kobold Helps Kathmandu, Launches Website To Aid In Nepal Earthquake
</headline>

<text>
Three years ago, Michael Kobold of Kobold Watch arrived in Kathmandu for the opening of a workshop he created there to honor and help the culture that saved both his life and the life of his wife. Kobold's deep ties to the region had begun years earlier during attempts to climb Mount Everest.

Kobold first went to Kathmandu in 2008 with his friend, preeminent explorer Sir Ranulph Fiennes. He had spontaneously decided to accompany Fiennes on an Everest summit bid. Basically unprepared to climb, and he had not even reckoned with reaching what’s known as base camp (the last acclimation settlement before serious climbers head up the 8,848-meter peak of Earth’s highest mountain). But he made it up much higher before both he and Fiennes had to turn back.

Returning in 2009, they made it to the summit; Kobold repeated the feat in 2010 together with his wife Anita Ugyan, who climbed without oxygen. During the three adventurous climbs, the lives of Kobold and other members of his crew, including his wife, were seriously endangered. Only by the grace of their Sherpas did they survive, and in his gratitude Kobold decided to bring Namgel and Thundu Sherpa to his Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, workshop to train them as watchmakers. To find out more about this background, please read The Kathmandu Backstory: Michael Kobold And Sir Ranulph Fiennes On Conquering Everest, Being Loyal, And Literally Exercising Gratitude.

Kobold’s ultimate goal in this was to have them run a new subsidiary in Kathmandu called Kobold Watch Company Nepal (Pvt.) Ltd as co-owners (see photos from the opening here). In this way, the two Sherpas would be able to escape their dangerous job while at the same time bringing watchmaking to Nepal.

To say that Kobold is involved in Kathmandu would be to put it mildly. Not only did he and Ugyan get married there, but Kobold often takes initiatives that go toward helping infrastructure in Kathmandu. All with the idea of bettering the lives of the Sherpas in mind.
