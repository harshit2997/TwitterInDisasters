LONDON (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - Governments, aid agencies and celebrities on Monday intensified a push for funding to help survivors of a deadly earthquake in Nepal as the risks posed by a lack of food, water and shelter escalated hourly.

More than 3,700 people were killed and at least 6,500 injured when the 7.9 magnitude quake rocked Nepal on Saturday, toppling houses and triggering avalanches in the Himalayas.

The Nepali government has appealed for foreign assistance with the aftermath of the worst earthquake to hit the South Asian country since 1934 when 8,500 died.

"Heart in #Nepal today. Met wonderful people there 4 wks go. I'm giving to Oxfam, pls join me," tweeted Harry Potter author JK Rowling.

As aid experts took to Twitter to urge well-wishers to donate cash to reputable relief groups rather than rushing in unwanted goods or help, funding pledges mounted.

According to the U.N. Financial Tracking Service, $5.7 million in funds had been received so far with Britain the biggest donor, followed by the United States and Japan.

The Asian Development Bank said on Monday it was providing a $3 million grant for tents, medical assistance, food and drinking water. It also announced up to $200 million for recovery efforts.

The World Health Organization, which warned that hospitals in the capital Kathmandu were overwhelmed by the number of casualties from collapsed buildings, said it had released $175,000 in funds and appealed for $5 million.

Doctors were reportedly treating survivors on the streets, the WHO said.

Britain, which deployed medics and search and rescue teams to Nepal at the weekend, announced a $7.5 million package.
