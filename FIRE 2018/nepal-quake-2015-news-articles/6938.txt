Members of the contingent were received by Minister in the Prime Minister’s Office and Second Minister for Home Affairs Masagos Zulkifli at Changi Airport at 11.35pm.

The crew, comprising 66 Singapore Police Force (SPF) officers and 60 Singapore Civil Defence Force officers (SCDF), carried out search and rescue operations in Kathmandu and rendered medical assistance and provided humanitarian aid in Gorkha. The contingent was supported by a forensic pathologist from the Health Sciences Authority (HSA).

Masagos expressed his appreciation to the officers for their dedication to duty and also thanked their family members for their support and encouragement. He said, “Despite the challenging conditions on the ground, you carried out your mission professionally to save lives and help those in need. Singapore and the Home Team are very proud of you.” — TODAY
