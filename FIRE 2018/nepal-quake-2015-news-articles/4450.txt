LONDON: UK has released a £15 million package of emergency aid which will help finance a team of 30 carrying eight tonnes of equipment including medical supplies and bandages to quake-hit Nepal.British Gorkha soldiers have already started providing assistance to 200 nationals at their base through first aid and logistical support. They are also providing language assistance to international search and rescue teams as they speak both English and Nepali.Foreign secretary Philip Hammond said, "We've got a British Army Gorkha team that was on Everest that is continuing to trek down the mountain and identifying and reporting British nationals on the way as they go. We've also got gorkhas from the Gorkha Training Base in Nepal who are assisting the local authorities."With many people, dead and alive, still trapped under collapsed buildings, Britain is also sending more than 60 search and rescue responders and medical experts to support the relief effort.An eight member team of British disaster and rescue experts will also help assess and coordinate the international effort.A Royal Air Force C-17 flight scheduled will carry 1,100 shelter kits and over 1,700 solar lanterns, along with a team of Gorkha engineers. The solar lanterns will help to charge phones, radios and torches.International development secretary Justine Greening said, "In Nepal, vulnerable people are sleeping out in the open, their homes destroyed. An RAF C-17 loaded with humanitarian supplies, vital shelter kits and Gorkha engineers is being deployed, to help thousands of people affected by the disaster".On April 25, a magnitude 7.8 earthquake struck an area between Kathmandu and Pokhara in Nepal. The Nepal government warned that the death toll could cross 10,000.Britain is also sending airfield handling equipment including two forklift trucks to facilitate the swift movement of aid supplies off aircraft and help to ease congestion at Kathmandu airport.Meanwhile, Nepali students from all across British universities - SOAS, UCL, LondonMet, LSE, Queen Mary, Imperial and Westminster held a meeting at Trafalgar Square to show solidarity with those back home.Hammond said the Foreign Office had estimated there were between 500 to 1,000 British nationals in Nepal but there was "no single coordinated list".Officials had assisted more than 250 British nationals and 583 "either have left the country or are not in the country or are accounted for and safe in the country", he said.
