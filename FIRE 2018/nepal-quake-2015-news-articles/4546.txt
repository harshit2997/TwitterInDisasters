HYDERABAD:All the 60 Telugu students, including 33 girls, enrolled with the College of Medical Sciences at Bharatpur in Nepal’s Chitwan district have been re-united with their families in different parts of Telangana and Andhra Pradesh.

The college management — International Society for Medical Education Private Ltd — has declared a 20-day break in the aftermath of devastating earthquake.

The college management also thanked the Telangana government for arranging a special flight from Kathmandu to New Delhi to bring back nine of the Telugu students stranded in Kathmandu. Bharatpur, about 200 km from Kathmandu, did not suffer much damage in the earthquake. Nevertheless, its 400-odd Indian students, hailing from different parts of the country, have been sent back home.

Speaking at a press conference here Tuesday, Vinayak K Pampati, director of the college, said “Special buses were arranged for bringing students safely to Gorakhpur and by trains, they were sent to New Delhi and then, to their respective towns. Only about 150 students, who are interning, are still working for the locals through our medical camps.”

He said he wanted to ensure the safety of all students and staff members. “There have been reports in media about damages and casualties in our medical college and hospital. I want to clarify that two major surgeries were going on at the time of the earthquake. Around 800 patients were carefully evacuated and surgeries were conducted successfully,” Pampati explained.

The medical college has deployed seven medical teams to provide succor to the injured people in and around Bharatpur.

Investigation and medical treatment are being offered free of cost. “Parents of students need not worry. Our college is committed to its students and the nation,” he stressed.
