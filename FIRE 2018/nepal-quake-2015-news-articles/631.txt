The Singapore Red Cross (SRC) is sending $50,000 worth of emergency supplies and relief items to quake-hit Nepal.

SRC is also launching an urgent public appeal for funds for relief and recovery efforts, it said in a news release on Sunday (26 April).

The Singapore government has donated S$100,000 as seed money for the Red Crossâ€™ fundraising efforts.

Members of the public can drop off donations at Red Cross House, 15 Penang Lane Singapore 236486 from 9am to 6pm Mondays to Fridays.

SRC is in contact with its partners in Nepal and are monitoring the situation closely. It plans to send disaster response personnel to the affected areas.

Hospitals in Nepal are struggling to cope with the worst quake in 81 years, and medical supplies are running low.
