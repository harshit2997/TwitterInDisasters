SEOUL, May 14 (Yonhap) -- South Korea raised its travel warning on parts of Nepal Thursday, warning against further earthquakes in the region.

The Ministry of Foreign Affairs said it raised the warning by one notch in Annapurna, Langtang and Mount Everest, which are popular travel destinations among South Koreans.

The new warning level advises Korean citizens to leave the affected areas. The rest of Nepal will remain under the lower warning level issued on April 27, which urges Koreans to refrain from traveling.

The decision came "in consideration of the high possibility of further earthquakes in Nepal in the coming months," the ministry said in a press release.

A 7.3-magnitude quake struck Nepal on Tuesday, killing dozens of people and injuring more than 1,000 others. Last month, the country was devastated by a powerful earthquake that left some 8,000 people killed.
