Charikot, Nepal: Hundreds of Nepali troops searched for a missing US Marine helicopter with eight people on board on Wednesday, a day after the second powerful earthquake in less than three weeks killed scores and sent panicked residents rushing out of buildings.

The US helicopter was delivering aid in Dolakha, one of the districts hit hardest by both quakes, on Tuesday when it went missing with six Marines and two Nepali troops on board.

In the district capital Charikot, relief and military helicopters brought people wounded when buildings collapsed and landslides struck in outlying hamlets to an open-air clinic where they were treated on bloodied tarpaulins.

The helicopters alternated between evacuating and helping find the Marine Corps UH-1Y “Huey” helicopter, which lost radio contact after its crew was heard talking about fuel problems.

A Nepali military official said it appeared the helicopter might have come down in one of the rivers that snake through valleys in Dolakha district east of the capital, Kathmandu.

Six other helicopters joined hundreds of ground troops in the search for the missing aircraft.

“The info we have is that it is down in one of the rivers, but none of the choppers has seen it yet,” Major Rajan Dahal, second-in-command of the Barda Bahadur Battalion, in Charikot, said.

“There are 400-plus of our ground troops looking for it also. By this evening, we might get it,” he said.

A spokeswoman for the Marines said there had been no confirmed sightings of the helicopter and that she did not have information that it had landed in a river. She said relief operations were ongoing, but diminished while the search was on.

“Primarily we want to make sure that we get all our service members and the Nepalese service members home safely. That is primarily where the focus has been today,” public affairs officer Cassandra Gesecki said.

Nepal Home Ministry official Laxmi Prasad Dahal said he feared the search was diverting resources from relief and rescue operations.

“The work of sending relief and rescuing the injured people to hospitals has been delayed due to this,” he said.
