Oxfam shop seeks support for Nepal
</headline>

<text>
Ballymena’s Oxfam Shop has issued an appeal for donations to aid Nepal’s earthquake victims.

Oxfam has begun delivering aid to thousands of people in Nepal following what was the largest earthquake to hit the country in 80 years.

When the buildings fell, terrified men, women and children were trapped inside. So far the earthquake has claimed more than 4,000 lives – although the death toll is rising all the time.

Right now, thousands more lives are hanging in the balance, as the impoverished country runs out of water, food and medicine. The situation is absolutely critical.

Oxfam is already providing clean water and sanitation for up to 100,000 people, along with delivering emergency food supplies and plans to reach 350,000 in the coming days.

Oxfam Ireland Chief Executive Jim Clarken says, although Ballymena Times readers are thousands of miles away, you can still help.

“Donating cash or your unwanted goods at your local Oxfam shop means we can respond fast. The sooner we can reach earthquake survivors, the greater the difference we can make. It really is a race against time to save lives,” he said.

“Please give what you can at www.oxfamireland.org or drop into your local Oxfam Ballymena shop at 125 Church Street. Thank you.”
