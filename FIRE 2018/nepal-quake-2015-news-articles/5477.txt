Traveling to Nepal on a wing and a prayer
</headline>

Since the April 25 quake that devastated Nepal, Yasmine Habash has wondered desperately where her mother might be. Dawn Habash was on a trek in near the Langtang National Park when it struck.

At first, Yasmine and her family sought to spread the word about Dawn, with a social media campaign and various interviews with news organizations.

Yasmine and her boyfriend are friends of mine, so I contacted her to share her story with the Juneau community. I'll try to add updates on this blog as I learn more. All the support shown in Juneau shows there are plenty who care.

The last bit of information gleaned from their efforts, posted to the facebook page dedicated to finding Dawn, was this:

"We just found out that our Mother, Dawn Habash, was most likely in Langtang Village at the time of the quake. There is a possibility that she may have been between Kanjin Gompa and Langtang Village or even a little south of the village. Please, please if anyone saw her there or around that area please let us know. We are very worried at this point. Thank you for your time."

The area was struck by landslides and at least 100 bodies have been recovered so far, CNN reported.

The family started a crowdfunding campaign to fund plane tickets to Nepal for Yasmine and her boyfriend, Reid Harris, with a goal of conducting a search and bringing supplies — Alaska Airlines waived baggage fees — then donating any additional funds toward relief. When they reached their initial goal, they doubled it, and have raised it again. They've raised more than $24,000.

Yasmine told the Portland Press Herald in Maine that helicopter rescue missions cost as much as $4,000.

Yasmine and Reid left for Nepal on May 4 from Boston and arrived on Tuesday. CNN reports they planned to head to the region Dawn was last seen from Kathmandu this morning.
