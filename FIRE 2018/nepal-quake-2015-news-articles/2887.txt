Raleigh runners to help those affected by Nepal earthquake
</headline>

A Raleigh running club and other groups with Triangle connections are making plans to reach out to people directly affected by this past weekend's deadly earthquake in Nepal.Monday night, dozens people met inside of the Tir Na Nog Irish Pub before their run with the "Nog Running Club," which is Wake County's biggest organization of its kind. One of its leaders, Ron Wahula, was climbing Mount Everest when the quake hit."When we found out that his trek was caught up in that it was really scary," said club member Kara Kraft, who says she found out about Wahula early that morning. "Just before we were leaving to run, we got word that he did check in and we knew he was OK and it was such a relief. At that point we didn't know that he was going to come home."Wahula's safety was more than a relief to his friends and family considering the images of Mt. Everest during the quake and the aftermath elsewhere showing the enormity of the destruction.When the Boston bombing happened the "Nog Running Club" raised about $20,000. Its members are brainstorming ideas to do the same for victims in Nepal."Really our goal is just to be an advocate for people to come out and have a good time and do good in the community," explained Rick Florez.Audrey Mark's cousin, Chris Butler, is stuck in the Kathmandu Valley. Butler is there doing work on a Fulbright Scholarship, and he is also helping to run Sam's House Orphanage Neither Butler nor any of the orphanage's 37 kids were injured, but they fear their buildings might not be safe because of unseen structural damage and aftershocks."The death toll just keeps rising and it's just absolutely devastating," explained Mark. "Nobody wants to go in just in case there is another earthquake and something happens -- a tremor, and the building would collapse on them -- so they're all sleeping outside."Butler and the children are now working to help others in need, while Mark is urging people who want to help monetarily to think long-term with their donations."A country as poor as Nepal is going to need ongoing financial support from the United States," said Mark.All kinds of international relief organizations are also working to help.
