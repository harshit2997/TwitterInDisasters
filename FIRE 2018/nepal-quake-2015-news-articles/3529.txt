<text>
Allo, Oman’s first over-the-top (OTT) international calling service and the flagship brand of Integrated Telecommunications Oman SAOC (TeO), came out in support of the Nepali community in Oman in the wake of recent earthquake by dropping its call rates to Nepal.

All calls to Nepal using Allo International Calling Cards from any mobile or landline in Oman will be charged at 33bz/min till April 30.

A statement from Allo said, “We are deeply saddened by the sever impact of the earthquake on the lives of the people in the affected areas, especially Nepal. Through this gesture, we would like to do our bit in extending a helping hand to the Nepalese community in Oman. Anyone calling Nepal using Allo services during the next three days will be charged at a deeply discounted rate of 33bz/min. We hope our Nepali friends across Oman are able to get in touch with their families and friends back home during this hour of crisis.”

Interested customers can use Allo services from their existing mobiles or landlines by purchasing an Allo International Calling Card from any recharge card outlet or convenience store across Oman. The service doesn’t require any Sim or internet connection.
