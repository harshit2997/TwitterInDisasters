In a major demonstrative support for the Government of Nepal in its efforts, the two houses of Japanese Parliament hosted two separate functions at their headquarters on Wednesday.

The total amounts collected from each house were handed over to the Ambassador of Nepal to Japan today by the two presiding officers of the House, Speaker of the House of Representatives and President of the House of Councillors.

German MP calls for continued support to Nepal

KATHMANDU: Philipp Messfeldar of CDU/CSU Party of Germany and Member of Parliament Of Germany has said that international aid must not stagnate due to the new earthquake.

Germany supports Nepal with 2.5 billion Euros of humanitarian emergency aid and these aid must be continued to prevent the situation from further worsening, he said. However, the country needs today, after the second earthquake, aid and solidarity of the international community, he said.

The humanitarian situation in the Himalaya region since the last earthquake is still difficult, he said further adding that the only international airport of the country in Kathmandu is overloaded and many roads are blocked due to the climatic situation. Bringing the aid to all the different regions in this hardly accessible country is very difficult even though the Nepalese government does their best, Messfeldar said
