San Diego Nonprofit Collects Supplies For Nepal Victims
</headline>

<text>
San Diego-based International Relief Teams announced Wednesday that it's collecting more supplies for people left homeless from the two major earthquakes that have struck Nepal.

The organization has already had two shipments of medical supplies delivered to the Himalayan country and also had some "hygiene kits" sent from neighboring India. The kits contain tarps, sleeping mats, fleece blankets, soap, towels, toiletries, water purification tablets and other supplies â€” enough for families of five to six people.

The organization is now collecting more of the kits and acquiring shelter for about 1,000 people. Financial donations are being accepted online at www.irteams.org or by mail at International Relief Teams, Attention: Nepal Earthquake, 4560 Alvarado Canyon Road, Suite 2G, San Diego, Calif., 92120.

The capital of Kathmandu and many mountain villages were devastated by a magnitude-7.8 earthquake on April 25. A magnitude-7.3 quake struck Tuesday.

Numerous U.S. and international relief organizations are active in Nepal.

The San Diego contingent includes a team of nurses from San Diego-based Scripps Health, Restore International, which funds a Kathmandu orphanage, and Camp Pendleton-based Marines.
