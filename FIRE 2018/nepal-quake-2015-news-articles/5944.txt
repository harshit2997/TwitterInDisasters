The death toll in the massive earthquake which struck Nepal on Saturday has passed 6,200, and many thousands are still unaccounted for as the home ministry said the 6,134 fatalities had been confirmed, with 13,906 injured, but new reports noted the figure has risen.

“The death toll from Nepal’s devastating earthquake has risen past 6,200 as fresh aftershocks and the smell of rotting bodies make it hard for nervous survivors to return to their homes,” writes ABC Friday morning.

Hundreds of bodies still being found daily in the Himalayan nation, forcing officials to order immediate cremations. Rescue teams are working quickly, but have been hindered by a minimum of 70 aftershocks, the strongest measuring 6.9 magnitude, the Indian meteorological department in Delhi said.

“Morgues are full beyond capacity and we have been given instruction to incinerate bodies immediately after they are pulled out,” said Raman Lal, an Indian paramilitary force official working in coordination with Nepali forces.

Many residents find it impossible to return home was the stench is overwhelming. The result is Nepalis sleeping in the open since Saturday’s quake. The United Nations reported that at least 600,000 houses have been destroyed or damaged.

Finance minister Ram Sharan Mahat said Nepal would need at least $2 billion to rebuild homes, hospitals, government offices and historic buildings and appealed for help from international donors.

“This is just an initial estimate and it will take time to assess the extent of damage and calculate the cost of rebuilding,” Mahat told Reuters.

More than 60 Australians have been evacuated from Kathmandu in RAAF C-17 Globemasters, which also delivered 15 tonnes of aid.
