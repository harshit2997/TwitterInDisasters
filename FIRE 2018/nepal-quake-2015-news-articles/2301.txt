Prabal Gurung has established a relief fund following the massive 7.9 earthquake that shook Nepal and its neighboring countries on Saturday. The fashion designer, who was born in Singapore and raised in Kathmandu, Nepal, used his social media accounts to promote his Crowd Rise fundraiser for the Shikshya Foundation Nepal. The educational organization, where Gurung is currently a board member, is channeling "100% of the funds" toward relief "based on the latest needs on the ground," according to an Instagram he posted Saturday.

The designer captioned the photo of the destruction with the message, "URGENT!! Nepal Earthquake Relief Fund. Donate & spread the message. Every dollar counts. #repost #PrayForNepal #HelpNepal." Gurung went on to emphasize the need for funds, stating, "the immediate need on the ground is for medical support, search and rescue, emergency shelters and food and water among many other things. As the days, weeks and months go by and after the humanitarian needs are addressed, Nepal will need to begin the healing and rebuilding process. The magnitude of the damage is still being assessed, but hundreds of buildings have collapsed including many homes and many of Nepal’s ancient and iconic temples and monuments."

As of Monday afternoon, the fundraiser has amassed over $255,000 in donations. Gurung, who has friends and family in the affected areas, has often cited his Nepalese roots as a major influence on his designs, telling The Wall Street Journal that the country's culture "is a constant source of inspiration."
