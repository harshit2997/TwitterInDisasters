JALANDHAR: There was panic among students hailing from Nepal at Lovely Professional University following the severe earthquake in their country. They were seen frantically trying to contact their families back home. While some could speak to their families, for others anxiety continued as phones in Kathmandu were not reachable."I was very worried as I was not able to speak to my family in Kathmandu. Then, an acquaintance told me that my family was safe," said Sushmita Gurung, a student of Bachelor of Pharmacy. Another student Swati Chaurasia said she and her friends from Nepal were worried and kept asking each other if they were able to contact their respective families."I could speak to my family in Birgunj and was told that the impact of the earthquake was lesser there and that they all were safe," she said, adding, "There are around a hundred students from Nepal at LPU."
