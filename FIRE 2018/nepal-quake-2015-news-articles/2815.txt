ROMPIN: The Royal Malaysian Air Force C130 Hercules aircraft ferrying medical staff and search and rescue officers has safely landed in Nepal to provide relief to earthquake victims.

Defence Minister Datuk Seri Hishammuddin Hussein said the aircraft landed at Tribhuvan International Airport in Nepal today.

He said their operations included repatriating 30 Malaysians, who were affected by the disaster.

"We will speed up the process to bring them home safely and coordinate with rescue teams from other countries to ensure the process goes on smoothly," he told reporters after attending a briefing on the by-election campaign at the Muadzam Shah Barisan Nasional operation centre here today.

Hishammuddin said the 64-member team from Malaysia, including 26 Special Malaysia Disaster and Rescue team (SMART) personnel would participate in humanitarian aid in Nepal.
