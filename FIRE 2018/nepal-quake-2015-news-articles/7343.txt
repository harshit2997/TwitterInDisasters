The 7.8 magnitude earthquake that struck Nepal on 25th of April at 11.56 a.m. local time had its epicenter in Gorkha. The one that struck on 12th of May at 12.50 local time had a magnitude of 7.3 and was centred southeast of Kodari (Sindhupalchowk District), 76 km northeast of Kathmandu. These two earthquakes created large scale damage across the country. More than 4.2 million people are affected, at least 18,000 are injured and 9,000 are dead from these violent quakes and the many aftershocks that continue. Many houses were destroyed or seriously damaged. Millions of people who have survived need food. Those who are injured need urgent medical assistance. In the immediate aftermath of the disaster, the Nepal Government launched a relief operation along with international partners.

Nepal is an extremely poor nation with GDP of less than $700 (USD) per capita. Beside the immediate rescue, food and shelter, what those affected need most is financial support. Nepalese people Living in Switzerland have started to collect donations to send back to Nepal.

Ms. Samjhana Thapa, who is from Nepal, works for a Swiss Biotech Company inside the EPFL Innovation park, which she joined after graduating from the Swiss University. She also works with the Nepalese community in Switzerland as women’s coordinator and executive member of the Non-Resident Nepali Association of Switzerland, and as Secretary of the Global Nepal Network in Geneva. Together these organizations have generated around CHF 18,000 to send back to Nepal.

Ms. Thapa along with Ms. Satchida Rana organized an event called ‘Drink for Nepal’ during the Lausanne Carnaval from the 8th to the 10th of May 2015. More than three thousand people visited the Nepal stall during this event. All the profit generated from the event will be transferred to Nepal as soon as possible. The home of Ms. Thapa’s parents has been destroyed by the two massive earthquakes, but her activities and energy extend beyond the personal, to support the needy people of Nepal.

For further information and to make a donation please don’t hesitate to contact, Ms. Samjhana THAPA at thapasamu@gmail.com
