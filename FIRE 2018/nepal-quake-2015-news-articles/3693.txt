KUALA LUMPUR, April 29, 2015:

The five determined Universiti Teknologi Malaysia (UTM) mountaineers in Nepal will withdraw from their expedition due to uncertain risks following last week’s earthquake.

At present, the mountaineers who were under the “Misi Perdana UTM Everest 2015” team were reported to be safe at the Everest Base Camp.

The five, identified as Azim Afif Ishak, 27; Anis Zulaikha Zabani, 25; Jamhuri Jumari, 21; Azham Afzanizam Hamzah, 27 and Farul Aidib Mahamad Yusoff, 21 were part of the climbing team from the Johor-based university that arrived in Kathmandu on March 28.

This was the second time that the UTM climbing team would withdraw from the Everest expedition. The team had prematurely left the same area in April last year due to a massive avalanche there.

UTM vice-chancellor Datuk Dr Wahid Omar said efforts were being taken to bring back the five with the assistance of the Foreign Affairs Ministry, the Malaysian Embassy in Kathmandu and the local authorities.

“We have been in touch with the mountaineers since the tragedy struck Nepal and at the same time we also constantly liaise with the Foreign Affairs Ministry and Malaysian Embassy on the current situation there,” he said in a statement today.

Wahid said UTM was proud of the team members determination, bravery and discipline shown by them during their mission to scale Mount Everest.

“However, due to the uncertain situation and dangers in the area, the team members will be returning to Malaysia for their own safety.”

The Rakyat Post reported last Sunday that the five, led by husband and wife team Azim and Anis, would carry on with their expedition despite the powerful earthquake that struck Nepal last Saturday.
