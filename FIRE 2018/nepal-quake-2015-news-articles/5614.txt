The father and son from Manitoba were just starting a worship service in the Vineyard Church in a Lalitpur near Kathmandu when the earthquake started April 25.

"It was just crazy, I just had an instinct to just run outside. I wasn't really thinking straight, it was just really crazy," Ben Thiessen said.

"I didn't really realize it was a big one until I was outside and that's when it really started to get bad and the ground really started shaking a lot. And there was buildings swaying around me and I was looking around making sure nobody was by any buildings in case they were going to fall. It was pretty wild," Thiessen said.

Meanwhile, his father Derryl was still inside the church.

"During the quake, I was at first looking around making sure nothing was going to fall on us and then I looked to see where he was, and he was gone, I couldn't see him anywhere," Derryl said.

"I thought the building was coming down on us because it was swaying from side to side and I knew that it was a very old structure. So we were all very thankful that no one was injured," Thiessen said.

The area they were in saw less devastation than other, older parts of Kathmandu because the buildings are newer.

Derryl Thiessen says luckily the building site they were at had WiFi, however, the power was knocked out in the earthquake.

Once the generator got up and running he says everyone was on their phones contacting family to let them know they were ok.

Thiessen said the need now in Nepal is for more critical response units, particularly in rural areas outside of Kathmandu.

He is heartbroken for the people of Nepal, saying the devastation is so bad some may never be able to rebuild their lives.

Derryl and Ben Thiessen will fly back to Canada Saturday.

They're encouraging Canadians to donate money to organizations that work directly in Nepal to help with the recovery.
