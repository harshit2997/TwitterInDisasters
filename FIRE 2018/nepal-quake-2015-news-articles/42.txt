UNICEF Canada calling for donations to help people of Nepal

UNICEF Canada is calling on Canadians to donate to the humanitarian group so it can help the people of Nepal following a deadly earthquake.

At least 1,180 were killed in the 7.8 magnitude quake on Saturday. The violently shaking earth collapsed houses, levelled centuries-old temples and triggered avalanches on Mt. Everest.

President and CEO David Morley said 42 per cent of the population of Nepal is under 18 years of age and they are the most vulnerable in an emergency.

“An earthquake of this size can be deadly, toppling buildings, and destroying roads and infrastructure,” Morley said in a statement released Saturday.

UNICEF has been working in Nepal since the 1960’s and is already on the ground, working to meet the needs of everyone affected.

“We are keeping our promise to Nepal’s children to always be there for them — in this emergency and every day,” he said.

Morley said communications are down so they don’t yet have a full picture of the devastation, but it’s clear there is loss of life and homes destroyed.

It was the worst tremor to hit the poor South Asian nation in over 80 years.

Ottawa is advising anyone concerned about Canadian citizens in the affected area to call Foreign Affairs, Trade and Development Canada’s 24/7 Emergency Watch and Response Centre at 1-800-387-3124.
