The Singapore Police Force will also send a contingent of officers to help with disaster relief efforts, including officers from its Gurkha Contingent, said the Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MFA) in a statement last night.

“In addition, Singapore is also looking at other areas of assistance, such as medical and humanitarian aid. The Singapore Armed Forces will also support the relief efforts with the deployment of suitable resources,” added the MFA.

To support Nepal’s disaster relief efforts, the Government will also contribute S$100,000 (RM268,000) as seed money to kick-start the Singapore Red Cross appeal for donations, said the ministry.
