KOTA KINABALU: A Sabahan family, stranded at a resort about 14km from Kathmandu during the devastating earthquake, is safe in the capital.

Despite damages to the road leading back to Kathmandu, the family of seven including three children returned safely to their home, which was also not damaged by the quake.

A family member, Afeiza Khan, said they are making preparations to return home.

She said her father Gulam Khan, 66, and mother Aishah Abdullah, 65, together with her sister Serena Khan and her husband Ismael Torawa and their three children – Iman Sara, Suleiman and Isaac – had checked into the Gokarna Forest Resort for the weekend when the earthquake struck.

“They are now preparing to return to Malaysia by Wednesday as the airport is now open. We will feel at ease once they are home,” she said.

Afeiza said her father, mother and sister together with her three children will return to Sabah but Ismael, who is attached with the United Nations Development Programme, stay back in Nepal to help out in the relief efforts in the area.

The family has been keeping in touch with relatives in Sabah through WhatsApp.

Afeiza, who is the press secretary to Sabah chief minister, said her parents had gone to Nepal about two months ago to visit her sister’s family.
