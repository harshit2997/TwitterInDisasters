People around the world and in Alabama are watching an international disaster unfold in Nepal, where a 7.8 earthquake has killed more than 5,000 people.

As many people wonder what they can do to help, one Birmingham Southern College student is taking action.

Saurav Bhandary is a native of Nepal who is attending college at Birmingham Southern. He didn't learn of the earthquake until early Monday morning when he awoke and a saw a professor had reached out to him, asking if his family were OK.

Fortunately, they were. But as he began to see the devastation in the country he calls home, he was shocked and saddened.

So many places he knows well now lies in ruins. He says his family is still sleeping outside of their home because they are afraid that if they go inside, the aftershocks will cause the houses to fall in on them.

While he has been in the U.S. he has been a part of an organization called Global Peace Exchange.

It's made up of students who have gone to Nepal and help with development over there.

Now that group is raising money and giving 100 percent of the funds to a group called Clinical Nepal, which is already there handing out medical supplies along with food and water.

"The support has been overwhelming right now and it kind of encourages me to step up and do something. The only thing I can do right now is to raise money because I cannot be there right now and I cannot not do anything right now. So we're just trying to raise some money. It doesn't matter how much money we raise. We're just trying to make some difference,‚Äù Bhandary said.

Bhandary has set up a display on the Birmingham Southern campus where he's asking co-eds to donate. They or anyone who'd like to help can also donate online here.
