Ottawa trekking group changes plans after Nepal quake

Plans have changed for an Ottawa-based charity group who had planned to hike to Everest Base Camp.

An update posted on Facebook by a Dream Mountains Foundation team leader Shawn Dawson says the group will not be attempting to hike to the camp, but still hopes to visit the Himalayas.

The team was scheduled to fly out to Lukla, Nepal, where they would begin the next step in their adventure. But flights have been cancelled and the group has been unable to leave Kathmandu.

“With luck, we will be able to fly out tomorrow morning,” wrote Dawson in a Facebook update Sunday. “But safety is our first concern and we will not take any unnecessary risks and all team members have chosen to continue and play it day by day.”

Dawson did reconfirm that all members were safe and comfortable at their hotel, the Yak & Yeti, but are still “understandably a little shaken up.”

According to the Dream Mountains Foundation website, the team was scheduled for a 16-day trip and were to return home on May 9.

Their trip included spending a few days in Kathmandu before flying to the village of Lukla where they would begin their hike to Base Camp.

Before reaching the mountain, the group would pass through Sagarmatha National Park before resting briefly in Gorek Shep, the last village before the Khumbu Icefall and then be on their way to the camp.
