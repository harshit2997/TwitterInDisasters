</headline>

<text>
FedEx Corp has committed approximately $1 million in cash, transportation support and a chartered flight to deliver critical medical aid and supplies to Nepal in the wake of last week’s devastating earthquake.



The Memphis-based global transportation and logistics company is mobilising its disaster relief program through its existing relationships with Direct Relief, Heart to Heart International, Water Missions International, American Red Cross and The Salvation Army, said a statement.



Frederick W Smith, chairman and chief executive officer, said: ”FedEx is committed to responding to the aftermath of the earthquake in Nepal. Working together with international relief organisations, we are utilising our global transportation network to assist in this massive recovery effort."



Through the company’s monetary and transportation contribution, FedEx will transport life-saving medical supplies and medicines, shelter, and water treatment systems to Nepal.



The specific contributions include transporting on behalf of Direct Relief large volumes of IV solutions, medicines, surgical supplies, and other medical essentials requested and approved by Nepal’s Ministry of Health and Population.



It will sponsor Heart to Heart International’s mobile medical clinic, which contains tents, vital medicines, medical supplies, portable medical equipment, communication equipment, non-perishable food and water purification systems.



It will transport 12 large Living Water Treatment Systems, 31 potable water chlorinators and 12 large water tanks on behalf of Water Missions International. Combined, these systems will provide fresh water for up to 370,000 people per day.



It will also provide a $250,000 cash donation to the American Red Cross, which works directly with the Nepal Red Cross Society and present The Salvation Army with a $50,000 cash donation.



Thomas Tighe, president and CEO of Direct Relief, said: “In response to enormous human tragedy in Nepal, Direct Relief is working to ensure that more lives are not put at risk by providing emergency medical aid to the country’s Ministry of Health and to local partners we have worked with for several years.



“The extraordinary step FedEx has taken in making this aircraft and its amazing team available is a powerful force-multiplier to the humanitarian effort underway.” - TradeArabia News Service
