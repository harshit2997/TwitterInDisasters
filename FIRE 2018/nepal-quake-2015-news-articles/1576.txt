Facebook and Google aid Nepal survivor search with people finder tools
</headline>

Facebook and Google are channelling their respective strengths in the fields of social networking and search in a bid to eliminate survivors from an ongoing hunt for victims following a devastating weekend earthquake in Nepal.

Facebook was able to put its recently launched Safety Check feature to the test by allowing survivors to log-in and confirm that they were alive and well, putting the minds at rest of all their contacts.

Similarly Google has also joined the hunt, re-launching its Person Finder tool to assist people in locating others, as well as sharing current news.

Whilst such services can be useful they are by no means a substitute for official channels and families and friends of loved ones in the area are still being urged to contact the Foreign Office directly if they have concerns.
