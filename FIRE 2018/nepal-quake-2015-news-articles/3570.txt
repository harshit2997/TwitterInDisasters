While rumours are rife that the first day income of forthcoming film Gabbar Is Back will go to the Nepal relief fund, actor Akshay Kumar says such decisions are taken by the film’s producers.

The actor took to Twitter to set the record straight.

“Heard a rumour that I am donating #GabbarIsBack’s 1st day collections to the #NepalEarthquake victims. Firstly I am not the producer so that’s not my call to make and more importantly I don’t need to wait for the film’s release to do my bit,” Kumar wrote.

Directed by Krish and produced by Sanjay Leela Bhansali and Viacom18 Motion Pictures, the remake of the 2002 Tamil film Ramanaa also features Shruti Haasan and Sunil Grover. The film is slated to release on May 1.

The actor also shared a link for people looking for ways to contribute to people in the Himalayan nation, which was jolted by a 7.9-magnitude earthquake on April 25. The toll in the devastating quake has risen to 4,680.

“If you too want to lend your support here’s the link ? https://www.facebook.com/nepalearthquakesupport,” Kumar shared.
