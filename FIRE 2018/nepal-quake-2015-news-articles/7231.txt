RICHARDSON, Texas, May 15, 2015 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Associa, the world's largest community management firm, recently sent a check, on behalf of Associa Cares, to the Red Cross for more than $14,000 to go directly toward relief efforts in Nepal following the April 25 earthquake.



"Associa Cares was put in place to help families and communities in need after a crisis or disaster," says Associa President and COO Joey Carona. "We may not manage any communities in Nepal, but these people are in desperate need of financial assistance and I'm proud to see our employees come together to lead this effort."



Associa's Client Shared Services Center (CSSC) employees in Richardson, Texas decided to get involved by planning an Associa Cares fundraiser in their break room on April 29, just days after the earthquake struck. All CSSC employees were encouraged to donate and wear red to show their support for the people of Nepal. The event raised $4,156 for the Red Cross and Associa Cares donated an additional $10,000.
