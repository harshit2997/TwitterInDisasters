Dozens killed after another powerful earthquake hits Nepal

Dozens of people have been killed by the 7.3 magnitude quake that hit Nepal on Tuesday, the International Organization for Migration said.

Paul Dillon, a spokesman for the organization, told CNN that the deaths occurred in the town of Chautara, east of Kathmandu.

The earthquake Tuesday was centered in a remote area of eastern Nepal, near the border with China.

It struck at a depth of about 9 miles, the U.S. Geological Survey said, slightly revising its earlier estimates.

The earthquake shook a country still picking up the pieces from the magnitude 7.8 quake that hit central Nepal on April 25, killing more than 8,000 people.

The epicenter of new earthquake was about 83 kilometers east of Kathmandu, the Nepali capital where many buildings were destroyed in the earlier quake.

The bustling city was once again plunged into panic as residents rushed into the streets.

“People are very scared and they don’t know what is going on,” said CNN iReporter Prashup Rajbhandari in Kathmandu. He said he thought the quake had cracked his house.

Another resident of the capital, Mingma Sherpa, said he and his friends jumped out of his car when they felt the earth begin to tremble. They ran with crowds of other people desperately seeking open space in a congested area of Kathmandu where there are few.

Police urged people to stay in open areas and keep roads clear.

Manesh Shrestha, a CNN producer, was with a group of people helping to clear debris in a town outside Kathmandu when the new quake struck.

He said it caused three or four damaged houses nearby to start to collapse.

Sabin Shrestha, a social activist in a village on the outskirts of Kathmandu, said dozens of houses around him that had suffered cracks in the last earthquake came down.
