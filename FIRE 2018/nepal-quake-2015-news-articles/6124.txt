This latest major earthquake to hit Nepal comes as recovery efforts are still on-going in the central districts devastated by the earthquake that struck on 25 April 2015. Our hearts go out to the families who have lost loved ones, and who had their houses and livelihoods destroyed by these two tragedies.It is estimated that millions of workers were affected by the first earthquake. This number is likely to rise in the coming hours and days as the result of the second earthquake.The need to help vulnerable households rebuild their lives is more urgent than ever. In the medium term, and to ensure a sustainable recovery, small and medium enterprises in sectors such as tourism will require significant support.The International Labour Organization (ILO) will continue to work closely with its partners on the ground, including the Government of Nepal, to assist in reconstruction efforts.
