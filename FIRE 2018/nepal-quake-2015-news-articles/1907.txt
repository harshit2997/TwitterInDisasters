Plea for donations for earthquake victims

THE needs of children and vulnerable communities in Nepal must be prioritised in the wake of the weekend’s devastating earthquake.

THE needs of children and vulnerable communities in Nepal must be prioritised in the wake of the weekend’s devastating earthquake.



Plan International is preparing for the co-ordinated distribution of immediate aid and trying to reach remote and cut-off rural communities to assess the immediate needs of impacted areas.

Plan is receiving reports of widespread devastation in remote districts located just west of the earthquake’s epicentre, with a further 6.7-magnitude aftershock felt in the region, closing Kathmandu airport and hampering the delivery of aid.

We have teams that have gone into remote communities in Makwanpur and Baglung, close to the epicentre, and an assessment team is headed to Pokhara.

There is widespread destruction, collapsed buildings, schools severely damaged, and many roads are blocked due to landslides in rural­ areas.

Some of the worst affected areas are communities of Dalit people, sometimes referred to as the “untouchable”­ caste.

These are already some of Nepal’s­ poorest and most marginalised, vulnerable communities, making their needs all the more urgent­ and acute.

We’re working to co-ordinate aid in these areas, and prioritising the needs of children and the most vulnerable.

Experienced teams from Plan Nepal are in communities throughout the affected areas, and teams of international specialists are en route to Nepal to aid the relief effort.­

We know Australians are generous people and our friends in Nepal are in urgent need of our support.

We hope every Australian can make a donation – even the smallest donation can make a huge difference to people who really need our help right now.

Australians can donate to Plan’s Nepal earthquake appeal by visiting plan.org.au or by ringing 137 526.

Mattias Bryneson,

Plan Nepal country director
