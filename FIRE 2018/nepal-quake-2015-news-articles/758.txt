nsnbc : Thousands remain trapped in the ruins of collapsed buildings after a magnitude 7.9 earthquake struck Nepal on Saturday. So far, at least 1,989 people perished due to the disaster.

The epicenter of the earthquake with a magnitude of 7.9 on the Richter Scale was only 80 miles from Nepal’s second-largest city Pokhara. Geologists and Nepali authorities noted that it was due to the fact that the quake was very shallow that it was so destructive. The capital Katmandu has been seriously affected by the quake too.

While rescue operations are ongoing in Katmandu and Pokhara, there are many remote regions where the population has to fend for itself until rescuers can arrive.

Thousands are still be trapped under the rubble of collapsed buildings.

The death toll is expected to rise significantly as the chances for survival of the thousands who are trapped are decreasing by the hour.

Among the collapsed structures in Katmandu are the 60 meters tall Darahara Tower as well as temples and other sites which usually attract national as well as foreign sightseers.

About 40 people in neighboring India lost their lives due to the quake.

The Indian Embassy in Nepal announced that India would deploy 285 rescuers from India’s National Disaster Response Force to assist the Nepali rescuers.

An international relief effort has been launched to provide food, clean potable water, sanitation and other much-needed items. Among the participating nations are, thus far, Britain, China, India, Pakistan, and the United States.

The Chinese government deployed a Search and Rescue team, including 65 rescue dog handlers and dogs. China expressed its deep sorrow over the deadly earthquake and pledged all kinds of assistance to Nepal at this time of emergency.

Simon Redfern, professor in Earth Sciences at University of Cambridge would note that the disastrous consequences in the earthquake prone country are a blend of seismic activity, poor building standards and haphazard urbanization.
