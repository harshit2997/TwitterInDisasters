Highlights o WFP’s Executive Director, Ertharin Cousin, visited Nepal from 1 to 3 May 2015, where she held meetings with Emergency Relief Coordinator, Valerie Amos, and the EU Commissioner for Humanitarian Aid and Crisis Management, Christos Stylianides, who were also in-country.

o The Executive Director met government authorities and WFP staff and humanitarians involved in relief efforts. She also flew across the affected areas to witness first-hand the extent of the earthquake’s impact on the more remote locations. During her visit, she appealed to the international donor community to fund critical relief efforts, including WFP’s US$116.6 million Emergency Operation and US$34 million Special Operations which provide a common services platform for the humanitarian community.

o Just over a week after the earthquake, WFP has distributed rice and high-energy biscuits to more than 196,000 people and has positioned supplies to feed about half a million people in the worst-affected areas.

o Food distributions are being combined with the delivery of much-needed medical supplies and tarpaulins for shelter as well as hospital equipment and other urgent relief items to reach remote districts, in collaboration with humanitarian partners.

o WFP’s Vulnerability Analysis and Mapping (VAM) assessment has identified three priority areas across highly-affected districts. WFP estimates that 1.4 million people are in need of immediate food assistance (see map on page 3).

o As of 3 May, WFP has handled more than 2,500 cubic meters of humanitarian cargo for over 30 organizations at the Humanitarian Staging Area (HSA), funded by the United Kingdom.
