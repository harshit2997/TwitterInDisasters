Nepal earthquake: Rescuers pull out woman alive from debris 50 hours after quake
</headline>

Rescue workers of India's National Disaster Response Force (NDRF) pulled a Nepalese woman alive from debris on 27 April, 50 hours after a powerful earthquake struck Nepal. The woman was then rushed to a nearby hospital in Kathmandu.

"We got the information that a lady is stuck between two slabs. There is some cavity and she is alive. Firstly, we stabilised the particular area and then we gave some life-saving medicine to that particular lady. After stabilising her, we just took her out," said Kulish Anand, NDRF assistant commandant.

International aid has finally begun to arrive in the Himalayan nation of 28m people, as the death toll topped 4,000 people.

About 6,500 more people were injured in Nepal's most deadly quake in 81 years. It triggered a huge avalanche on Mount Everest that killed at least 17 climbers, including foreigners, the worst single disaster on the world's highest peak.

A series of aftershocks, severe damage from the quake, creaking infrastructure and a lack of funds have slowed the disbursement of aid to those most in need.

While aid has begun arriving in the capital, including food, medical supplies, tents and dogs trained for rescue efforts, the authorities are still struggling to deliver relief further afield.
