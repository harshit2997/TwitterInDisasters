Death toll from Nepal's earthquake has hit 4,485 and the number is expected to rise as rescue workers struggle to retrieve people trapped in collapsed buildings in capital Kathmandu and other areas.

Prime Minister Sushil Koirala said Tuesday the death toll could reach as high as 10,000.

"The death toll could go up to 10,000 because information from remote villages hit by the earthquake is yet to be received," he said.

Laxmi Prasad Dhakal, spokesman of Nepal's home ministry, said the number of injured people stood at 8,235 as of Tuesday afternoon.

At least 31 out of 75 districts have been affected by the 7.9-magnitude earthquake with the capital city hit hardest.

Dhakal said rescue workers had been working overnight in the last three days.

Reports from districts outside Kathmandu are inconsistent as rescue workers have not been able to reach villages hit by the earthquakes.

The government has mobilised helicopters to transport those injured for treatment in hospitals.

The international community has pledged aid worth over US$3,000,000 to Nepal with US$1,000,000 from the United States.

India has sent 1,000 National Disaster Response Force personnel to help with search and rescue efforts.

China, Japan, Bangladesh, Pakistan, Bhutan and the European Union have dispatched medicines and relief materials to the earthquake victims.

More than 100 aftershocks have been felt over the past three days since the first quake struck Nepal last Saturday.
