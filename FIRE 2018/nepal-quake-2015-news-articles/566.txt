Following Quake, Israelis Use Facebook, Other Social Media, to Locate Loved Ones in Nepal
</headline>

<text>
Israeli are turning to Facebook and other social media platforms to try and learn about missing loved ones in Nepal, following a devastating earthquake that struck the Himalayan nation. 200 Israelis were initially reported missing in Nepal, but more recent reports put the number at about 150.

The Times of Israel reports:

Many Israelis went on Facebook seeking help locating family members in the country, which is a popular destination for backpackers. “My brother Atar Dan is in Nepal and hasn’t been in contact since the morning. He left four days ago from Kathmandu for Everest,” Ohad Dan wrote on the social media site, asking people to share the message. … A Facebook group called “Nepal earthquake updates and Israelis found” was set up as clearing houses for those searching for information on people in Nepal and the online forum Rotter published lists of Israelis who were uninjured but unable to contact family.

The Facebook group is located here.

Facebook recently activated a new feature that allows users to inform friends and family of their status if they are caught in disaster areas. The app WhatsApp circulated a list of Israelis found to be safe.

Viber, the Israeli-designed messaging service, will allow free calls to and within Nepal for its users.

Israel is sending rescue teams to Nepal to help with the rescue efforts.
