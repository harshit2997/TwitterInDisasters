FOLLOWUP: West Seattle kids raise money to help Nepal
</headline>

<text>
Lots of kindhearted people out and about on West Seattle Community Garage Sale Day, with benefit sales and post-sale donations. The generosity includes what these kids did, setting up shop along California SW in Gatewood to sell lemonade and treats to help earthquake survivors in Nepal!

They were only out for three hours this morning but they were able to raise $180 for Nepal SEEDS, according to Sandy, who shared the photos afterward, explaining that their friend Cris Miller, a West Seattleite, is on the group’s board, and that Nepal SEEDS is “in major fundraising mode to assist in earthquake relief and re-building in the villages they work in.”
