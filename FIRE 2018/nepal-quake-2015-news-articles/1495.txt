Big Challenges Await Nepal Relief Effort
</headline>

<text>
There is still a lot we don’t know about the scope and scale of destruction in Nepal. Much of the affected communities are remote and hard to access. “The United Nations has said that more than six million people live in the areas of Nepal that have been affected. Many individuals have either lost their homes or have been forced to live on the streets because of the threat of further aftershocks. The global response is being coordinated by the Nepalese government through its National Emergency Operation Center. ‘What’s important to remember about Katmandu is that it’s densely, densely packed,’ said Gary Shaye, the director of humanitarian operations for Save the Children who worked in Nepal in the 1970s and 1980s. ‘This is a village that grew into a city.’ He added, “There is not a lot of open space to accommodate people who get displaced.’ Rain descended on Katmandu on Sunday, and Mr. Shaye said that the relief efforts faced a “race against time’ because the monsoon season begins in June.” (NYT http://nyti.ms/1DqYPtj )

Chaos in Burundi…Tens of thousands of Burundians are reported to have fled to neighboring Rwanda in recent days. “Hundreds of people in Burundi have protested in the capital Bujumbura after the country’s ruling party nominated President Pierre Nkurunziza to run for a third term. There were clashes between protesters and armed police in Bujumbura. Police fired teargas to break up crowds and also blocked access to some parts of the city. Watchdog groups and observers had warned of possible unrest if Nkurunziza decided to run again. Thousands of Burundians have already fled the country before presidential elections on 26 June. Burundi’s constitution stipulates that a president can only serve for two terms, but Nkurunziza’s party says he is eligible for another term as popularly elected president because for his first term he was elected by lawmakers.” (Guardian http://bit.ly/1FoD4An)
