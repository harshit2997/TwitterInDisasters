The first military plane carrying aid materials from the Chinese government has arrived in Kathmandu, Nepal's capital.

The aid is part of 186 tons of aid pledged by China and includes tents, blankets and electric generators, which will be sent to Nepal in batches.

The Chinese Foreign Ministry says 170 people from the military are also in Kathmandu to join the relief efforts and more will arrive.

The Red Cross Society of China is also preparing to send a team to Nepal.

The aid team will help their Nepali counterparts set up 2,000 tents donated by the RCSC and relocate residents in quake zones.

Meanwhile, more than 2,000 Chinese citizens who had been in Nepal when Saturday's eartquake hit have made it back to China via commercial flights.
