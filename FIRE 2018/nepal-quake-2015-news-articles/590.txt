The Nepalese Student Association at the University of Colorado at Boulder is using tonight's previously planned cultural event to raise money for victims of Saturday's earthquake in Nepal.



More than 2,500 people have been confirmed dead in the massive earthquake.



The event starts at 5:30 p.m. in CU's Glenn Miller Ballroom and will include a performance from the band 1974 AD, whose members flew in from Nepal on Wednesday, and local acts.



Organizers said the event is “a call for action to all those in the Colorado community to aid Nepal. We hope to raise major funds through optional donations and raise awareness throughout the Boulder area.”



The event is free for CU students and $2 for community members.



To donate, go to gofundme.com/sxxfg8.
