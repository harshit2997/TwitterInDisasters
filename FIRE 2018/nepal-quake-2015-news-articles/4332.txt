Nepal earthquake: Incredible tales of survival
</headline>

<text>
ASTONISHING images have emerged of a tiny miracle baby being pulled alive from the rubble in earthquake-devastated Nepal.

As desperate survivors of the 7.8-magnitude quake clash over scarce food supplies, the photos of four-month-old Sonit Awal rescued from the ruins has sparked glimmers of hope.

Kathmandu Today reported Nepali soldiers found the dust-covered infant after hearing his cries during a search in the town of Bhaktapur, about 22 hours after the quake hit on Saturday.

Sonit is said to be in a stable condition without any internal injuries, according to CNN.

As Nepal’s Prime Minister Sushil Koirala claimed the death toll could double to 10,000, other incredible stories of survival emerged.

On Tuesday, after a staggering 80 hours under rubble with three dead bodies, 28-year-old Rishi Khanal was pulled to safety.

It took more than 10 hours for the rescue team to drill through the concrete and haul him up through a hole.

A doctor who treated Khanal said he “survived by sheer willpower”.

“I had some hope but by yesterday I’d given up. My nails went all white and my lips cracked. I was sure no one was coming for me. I was certain I was going to die,” he said.

“There was no sound going out, or coming in. I kept banging against the rubble and finally someone responded and came to help. I hadn’t eaten or had anything to drink so I drank my own urine.”

Mother-of-four Tanka Maya Sitoul was trapped in the rubble of a five-floor building in Kathmandu for 36 hours before she was freed. She survived the collapse thanks to a beam.

“I heard people making noise outside, so I thought I would be rescued,” she told CNN through an interpreter.

“I was just lying down. There was no room to move here and there.”

The woman’s husband said he called out for help for hours because he could hear his wife’s cries.

Jon Keisi was buried for more than 60 hours in Kathmandu before rescue workers could carve a tunnel deep enough to get him, CNN reported. His rescuers said they were confident he would survive.

Violence erupts on Nepal’s streets

The incredible tales come amid reports that desperate survivors have clashed with riot police in Nepal’s capital, as supplies of food and water run thin.

Desperate to leave, thousands of people gathered outside the main bus station after the government promised to lay on special services to far-flung rural areas.

But when the buses failed to materialise, anger surged and scuffles broke out between the crowds and riot police who were sent to try to contain the situation near parliament.

Desperate crowds turn on police

Some protesters forced a truck carrying drinking water off the road and climbed on top of it, throwing the bottles to the crowd.

“We’ve been left starving in the cold and the best this government can give us is this queue. Why are they so slow?” demanded Rajana as she lined up along with thousands of others for a bus to her home village.

“I keep hearing on the news that all governments and aid agencies are here, but where are they? Our government is totally absent. Forget shelter, they couldn’t even give us water,” said Rajana, who goes by one name.

Columns of riot police stood behind rolls of barbed wire as rioters armed with sticks surged into the street, attacking buses and other vehicles.

Hundreds of thousands of people across the country settled down for a fifth night under tents. Their homes were either wrecked or were feared to be on the verge of collapse.

But with the number and scale of the aftershocks subsiding, some residents returned to salvage possessions from the ruins of their homes, grabbing everything from fridges to family chickens.

UN: 1.4 million need food aid

The United Nations has appealed for $US415 million for Nepal, adding that at least 1.4 million people need food aid.

They said that around 70,000 houses have been destroyed and another 530,000 damaged. One estimate has put the cost of reconstruction at $US5 billion.

“Although I am heartened and encouraged by the progress of the response to date, efforts need to be maintained and stepped up to ensure vital assistance reaches all the affected, especially those in the remote areas,” said UN resident co-ordinator for Nepal, Jamie McGoldrick.
