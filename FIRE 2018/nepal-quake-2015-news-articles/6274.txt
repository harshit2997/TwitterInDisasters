UAB and local residents from Nepal to host fundraiser Friday for quake victims
</headline>

<text>
Members of the University of Alabama at Birmingham community from Nepal, along with the Alabama Nepalese Association, will host a fundraiser to help victims of the recent earthquakes in that country at The Edge of Chaos events venue on campus on Friday at 5:30 p.m., according to a UAB news release.

The group - including UAB faculty, staff, students and alumni from Nepal - is seeking donations to support the immediate needs of those affected by the disaster.

The April 25 quake, measuring 7.8 on the Richter scale, killed more than 8,000 people and injured nearly 18,000 people. In addition, a half million or more people -- including children -- have been displaced from their homes and threatened by landslides and aftershocks.

To make matters worse, on Tuesday, Nepal was hit by another powerful earthquake, this one measuring 7.3 on the Richter scale.

"Alabamians are no strangers to natural disasters and know first-hand how hard it can be for a community or nation to recover from devastation of this magnitude," Samir Rana, a graduate student in the UAB Department of Psychiatry and native of Nepal, said in the news release. "Please help us provide the support and supplies that are so desperately needed."

"There is nothing that encompasses all aspects of the work of public health more than a natural disaster," Edge of Chaos director David Hooks said in an email to AL.com on Tuesday, referring to the fact that the venue is funded by the UAB School of Public Health. "We had an opportunity to see this up close and personal on April 27, 2011, with the tornadoes that hit Alabama. This is an opportunity for us to repay the outpouring of support that the world showed to us"

Birmingham businessman Kent Stewart -- an avid mountain climber who survived the April 25 quake while preparing to scale Mt. Everest -- is to host another fundraiser for quake victims at Oak Mountain State Park on June 6.
