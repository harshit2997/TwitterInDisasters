MUADZAM SHAH: A Malaysian Armed Forces' (ATM) C130 Hercules aircraft carrying 64 rescuers and medical teams arrived at the Forward Operations Base, Tribhuvan International Airport, Kathmandu in Nepal, this morning.

Defence Minister Datuk Seri Hishammuddin Tun Hussein said the plane departed from the Subang Air Base at 6am Monday and arrived at the Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose International Airport, India, at 12.15pm on Monday, before proceeding to Kathmandu.

"The aircraft was carrying an Armed Forces medical team of six, two officials of the National Security Council, Special Malaysia Disaster Assistance and Rescue Team (26 people) and the Malaysian Red Crescent Society (MRCS) (seven people).

"There was also the Medical Relief Society (Mercy) Malaysia (seven people), an officer of the United Nations World Food Programme (WFP) and 15 crew," he told reporters after attending a briefing with the Barisan Nasional (BN) election machinery at the BN operations room in Muadzam Shah here, today.

Hishammuddin said that 30 Malaysians living in Kathmandu were safe, but they needed help.

"I am waiting for the report in order to bring them home as it should be coordinated with other teams at the international level. As chairman of Asean, Malaysia cannot think of only our people but priority (to take home) must also be given to people of other Asean countries," he said.

The ministry would also help in terms of logistics to ensure that the assistance provided to the people of Malaysia also reaches those in need in Nepal.

On Saturday, an earthquake measuring 7.9 on the Richter scale hit Nepal with devastating force in the region between the capital Kathmandu to Pokhara city at 2.56pm (Malaysian time) sending strong tremors across Northern India. â€“ Bernama
