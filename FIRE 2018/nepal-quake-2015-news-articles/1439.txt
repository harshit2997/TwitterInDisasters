Water Missions: Trip to Nepal could be most difficult in nonprofit's history

NORTH CHARLESTON, S.C. (WCIV) -- A Lowcountry nonprofit is making the trek across the world from Charleston to Nepal to help those who survived this weekend's 7.8-magnitude earthquake.

However, the trip is proving to be a difficult journey to make for Water Missions International.

The organization plans to send three staff members and five water treatment systems to Nepal this week. While the tools for clean water will be shipped from Charleston, staff members are being sent from around the world.

"Our logistics coordinator, who is already en route, is based out of Copenhagen, Denmark," said George Greene, Chief Operating Officers for Water Missions International.

Greene says the trip to Nepal will be one of the most challenging trips to achieve in the nonprofit's history.

"We are in Phase 1 of our initial response right now," Greene said. "We have a measured response associated with enough water treatment equipment to provide water for somewhere between 50,000 to 75,000 people."

Greene says the nonprofit last traveled to Nepal in 2011. However, this trip may force staff members to travel through India since flights to the airport in Nepal's capital city are backlogged.

"Sending our U.S. citizens to India to then be able to travel by land into Nepal presents its own difficulties. We found out when we first started out looking into [this] that India has a four-day lead time with getting a visa just to go into India," said Greene.

Greene says this is just the beginning of their response to the disaster in Nepal. Greene says the span of their response will depend on how much financial support they will receive.

When an earthquake hit Haiti, the organization sent nearly 40 volunteers and 150 water systems.
