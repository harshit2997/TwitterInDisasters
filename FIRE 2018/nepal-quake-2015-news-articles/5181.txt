While Cameron called the scale of India’s rescue and relief in Nepal “incomparable” to any other country’s, he also thanked India for the quick custom clearances for the nearly 11 tonnes of relief supplies Israeli embassy in New Delhi sent to Nepal. All the supplies like medicines, tents, food and water were sourced from Delhi.

He further pointed that the Israeli military field hospital in Kathmandu was "up and running in 96 hours from the tragedy" treating about 200 victims everyday.

Other Israeli diplomats who participated in the Nepal aid mission acknowledged India’s quick air space clearances for Israeli air force aircrafts and promt issuance of visas by Indian consulars for Israeli citizens who had to be evacuated from Nepal through India.

According to Israeli embassy officials in New Delhi, about 700 trekkers from that country were in Nepal at the time of earthquake. “About 100 of them had got stranded near the Everest whom we rescued. Two more batches of 230 and 260 Israelis were evacuated later by country’s military aircrafts.
