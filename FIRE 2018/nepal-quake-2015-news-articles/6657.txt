WASHINGTON â€” A U.S. Marine helicopter delivering aid to earthquake victims in Nepal was declared missing Tuesday after it lost radio contact with units on the ground, military officials said.

The Huey helicopter had six U.S. Marines and two Nepalese servicemembers aboard, according to a statement from Joint Task Force 505, which carries out the humanitarian operations.

There were no indications it crashed. Nepalese military forces on the ground searched the vicinity of the helicopter's last known location. A search using Nepalese and U.S. military aircraft will resume at daybreak Wednesday.

"The incident occurred near Charikot, Nepal, while the aircraft was conducting humanitarian assistance and disaster relief operations in support of the recent Nepal earthquakes," Army Maj. David Eastburn, a spokesman for U.S. Pacific Command, said in a statement.

He said the helicopter had evacuated injured people back to Kathmandu, the capital of Nepal.

The aircraft is part of Marine Light Attack Helicopter Squadron 469 based at Camp Pendleton, Calif.

A contingent of U.S. Marines is participating in a massive relief effort in the country, which was devastated by an earthquake less than three weeks ago that killed more than 8,000 people. Another earthquake hit Nepal Tuesday, and officials began to assess those damages.

About 300 U.S. military personnel are participating in the humanitarian relief efforts.
