COLDWATER, MI (WTVB) - On April 25, 2015, Nepal was hit with a massive earthquake measuring 7.8 on the Richter scale. More than 8,000 people lost their lives and over 17,000 were injured. Hundreds of thousands have lost their homes as neighborhoods and entire villages have been destroyed. On May 12, they suffered subsequent 7.3 and 6.3 earthquakes with several, strong aftershocks. This damage just compounds what occurred on April 25.

Coldwater physicians Dr Kamal and Dr Sabeena Pradhan, are from Kathmandu, Nepal. Their family is safe, but much of their home country is in ruins. They have direct contact with two hospitals in Nepal, Tribhuvan University Teaching Hospital and Kathmandu Model Hospital.

These hospitals are in desperate need of supplies to care for the injured. Due to government restrictions, it is difficult to deliver actual supplies to these hospitals. The Pradhans are partnering with the Community Health Center of Branch County Foundation to mobilize efforts in our community to help the people effected by the Nepal earthquake.

Funds are being collected by the CHC Foundation. All funds will go to the hospitals mentioned above to purchase pharmaceuticals, medical supplies, and equipment to help care for the injured.

Donations of can be mailed to CHC Foundation, 274 E. Chicago Street, Coldwater, MI 49036. You can also make a donation at www.chcbc.com, contact Terra Depew at (517) 279-5414.
