A German rescue organization and the French government say they are sending rescue and relief teams to earthquake-torn Nepal.



International Search and Rescue Germany says a team of 52 relief workers including doctors, experts trained in searching for people buried under rubble and several dog squads will fly to Nepal Sunday. The team will bring with them a mobile medical treatment center.



Spokesman Stefan Heine said the priority was to get to the scene of the quake as quickly as possible to find those still alive.



In France, the government said in a statement Sunday it is sending 11 rescuers and emergency equipment to Kathmandu Sunday.



The French Foreign Ministry has located 500 French citizens in the area who are alive and well.
