Human traffickers have become active on the Nepal border after the massive earthquake in the neighbouring country. “Human traffickers are taking advantage of the pathetic situation in Nepal,” said SSB Director General BD Sharma at Ranikhet today. “We came to know about increased activities of human traffickers operating from Nepal after we arrested a woman from Uttar Pradesh along the Nepal border and four children and a woman from the Nepal border in Bihar. The miscreants were bringing the women and the children to India on the pretext of getting them jobs,” said Sharma. The SSB chief, who was addressing mediapersons after inspecting the frontier headquarters at Amritpur and Ganiadholi, near Ranikhet in Almora district, said the force was concentrating on sending more relief material to Nepal so that the affected people did not face a shortages of essential goods. “We have sent five truckloads of relief material to Nepal on Saturday and are planning to send more aid,” he said.
