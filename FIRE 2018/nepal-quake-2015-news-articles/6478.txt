When Manju Bhatta hears the terrified screams of her daughter in the middle of the night, her heart breaks for the people in Nepal.

Sahana visited her grandmother in Nepal in January and had a fantastic time but now those memories have turned into a nightmare after the devastating earthquake which destroyed her family's village.

Mrs Bhatta said her seven-year-old daughter was heartbroken when she heard of the earthquake in Nepal late last month which has claimed thousands of lives.

"She [Sahana] has been so sad ever since. She remembers the school, that is no longer there, and is so worried about her grandmother," she said.

"My mother is okay but her house is badly damaged. If we hadn't done repairs to the house when we recently visited, I'm sure it would have collapsed."

Mrs Bhatta now lives in Berkeley but grew up in the Gorkha district - the epicentre of the April 25 earthquake.

She has teamed with Wollongong West Public School, which her children Sahana and Neeron attend, and set up a Nepal (Gorkha district) Disaster Appeal Fund.

"The aim is to collect funds to rebuild the collapsed schools and help out the local hospital in the Gorkha district," Mrs Bhatta said.

"Since I originally come from Gorkha, I know their immediate needs and why they are so behind in getting help. I know there are various charity organisations helping the Nepalese people right now, however, they are mainly focusing on accessible areas," Mrs Bhatta said.

The Gorkha district's isolation from the capital Kathmandu made it difficult for people to get into the area quickly to help those most at need.

"Children need to go back to school as soon as possible, not be scattered around the rubble. Children don't have a school or home to go to for shelter, currently they are homeless. "We know people here have big hearts and we can count on them, it is just a matter of reaching them."

Wollongong West Public School principal Cathy Reade said the appeal had so far raised more than $5000.

"As a school we were only too happy to help when Manju said she could organise for money raised to be passed on to a woman's group in the region which would directly help those communities most affected.

"Our SRC [Student Representative Council] had already agreed to do a fund-raiser to raise funds for the appeal and will hold a school disco later this week [Thursday or Friday]."

Schools for the Wollongong north area would also contribute.

"For our students this is important because it gives them a chance to be real life global citizens. They are raising funds and directly contributing to helping improve the lives of those people whose lives were devastated by the horrific earthquake."

Donations can be made via EFT by referencing Nepal Disaster Appeal, BSB: 032 001 and account number 156783.
