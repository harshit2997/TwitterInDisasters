Authorities in Nepal said that the number of people killed by the massive earthquake has risen to over 4,000. Here in Nebraska, students are trying to help out.

The Nepalese Student Association in Kearney is organizing a relief effort for Nepal. The group met at the Nebraskan Student Union Monday afternoon to discuss their plans.

They are accepting only monetary donations that they will use to help with food, shelter and other basic needs.

"The smallest contribution you make can make a world of differences to people. I mean people who are schooling you know little children who don't have anything to eat, who are crying and there's nothing their parents can do except hold them," said Nepalese Student Association member Bidhata Thapa.

The Nebraskan Student Union will have a table set up from 8 a.m. to 7 p.m. all week long. On Friday, they will be holding a candle light vigil around the fountain at UNK around 7p.m.

Catholic Social Services in Hastings is also collecting donations to help the victims in Nepal.
