As CRI's Huang Shan reports, at least three Chinese aid teams are joining the effort in Nepal, together with other international teams. Besides the thousands killed, Nepalese authorities say the massive quake has also injured more than 65-hundered people with Chinese and Indian officials reporting dozens of people killed in their countries. Nepalese officials have warned that the number of casualties could rise as rescuers reach remote areas of western Nepal. Meanwhile, massive tent camps have emerged in Nepal's capital, Kathmandu, for those displaced or afraid to stay indoors. The UN says at least 14 international medical teams are on the way to Nepal and up to 15 international search-and-rescue teams have been sent. China is sending its third batch of aid teams to the neighboring country. The 55-member team affiliated with China's armed forces is expected to carry out rescue missions as well as psychological counseling and medical aid. Another 45 Chinese soldiers are set to leave for Nepal tomorrow. The total 100 soldiers are bringing with four sniffer dogs, five recovery vehicles and rescue equipment, including life detectors and entry tools. A Chinese medical team carrying 13 tons of medical aid arrived in Nepal earlier today. The 58-strong medical team will stay in Nepal for about two weeks. The medical team has participated in medical rescue missions in previous major earthquakes at home. Meanwhile, China's non-governmental organizations are also offering a helping hand to the neighboring country. The Blue Sky Rescue Team, one of China's largest civilian rescue teams, has arrived in Nepal 36 hours after the country was struck by the powerful earthquake. Its team leader, Zhang Yong, says they hope to conduct their rescue operation within the golden 72 hours window available after a disaster. "We have marked some important regions and blind spots on the map. We will send our members to the epicenter of the quake. We believe the disaster situation there is very serious. After checking the quake-stricken scenes, if condition allowed, our team will carry out the work as soon as possible." The team has brought with a large batch of rescue materials, including unmanned aerial vehicles, electric generators, life detectors, mountain rescue equipment, and medicine. By applying the unmanned aerial vehicle to relief work, the team aims to rescue more victims in blind spots. For CRI, I'm Huang Shan.
