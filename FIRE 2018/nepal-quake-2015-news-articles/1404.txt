More than 600 Chinese citizens who'd been stranded in Nepal after a 7.8-magnitude earthquake struck there on Saturday morning have returned to China, Xinhua said today. A total of 500 of the passengers trapped in the quake-hit region were taken home on Chinese airliners yesterday.

According to the China National Tourism Administration, a total of 683 Chinese tourists, including 53 tourist groups and individual travelers, were in Nepal when the quake hit an area between the capital Kathmandu and Pokhara, leaving over 2,700 people dead and thousands more injured.

Victims in India, Bangladesh and Tibet have been reported as well. At least 20 Tibetans were reported dead and more than 200,000 affected by Sunday. Three of the four Chinese civilians killed were members of China's women's climbing team, who were caught up in a quake-triggered avalanche on Mount Everest.

China's first rescue team arrived in Nepal on Sunday as well. The 62-strong China International Search and Rescue Team spent four hours in Kathmandu and rescued its first survivor, a male in his 20s. The Blue Sky Rescue Team under the Red Cross Society of China also assembled a group of rescuers that flew out yesterday evening.

The Chinese government is sending humanitarian aid worth 20 million yuan to the Nepal government.
