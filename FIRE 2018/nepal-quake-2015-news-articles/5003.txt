EVANSTON, IL. May 1, 2015 - Several local businesses joined together on April 30 at a fundraising luncheon, raising more than $16,000 to benefit survivors of Nepal's catastrophic earthquake, which occurred April 25 and caused more than 6,000 fatalities and countless injuries.

Hagerty Consulting joined forces with Ramakant Kharel, owner of Mount Everest Restaurant, and Downtown Evanston to alert the community about the luncheon. More than 200 people streamed into the cheerful restaurant to make a donation and partake of a buffet of Nepalese dishes. Kharel committed to donating 10% of total sales from the luncheon to the Nepali American Center, a charitable organization based in Mount Prospect and dedicated to preserving, promoting, and sharing Nepali heritage and culture.

Steve Hagerty, president and founder of Hagerty Consulting, a management consulting firm specializing in helping clients prepare for and recover from disasters, committed to supporting AmeriCares, an international disaster relief organization, and offered to match 100% of any additional donation made by to AmeriCares at the luncheon. More than 60 individuals and companies contributed over $8,000. Along with the matching gift, the total amount raised for AmeriCares is more than $16,000.

Mount Everest Restaurant is also hosting another fundraiser on Sunday, May 3 from noon to 3 p.m. Kharel plans to donate 100% of monies raised on Sunday toward the Nepali relief effort.
