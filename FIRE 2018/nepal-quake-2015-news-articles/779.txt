NEW DELHI: Even as India sent IAF aircraft with relief materials and rescue teams with sniffer dogs to Nepal, the Ministry of External Affairs and the Indian Embassy in Kathmandu scrambled to track Indian citizens which has turned out to be a a massive task, thanks to the open borders and collapsed communication channels. At 11.41 am, one of the largest earthquakes Nepal has ever witnessed, hit the countryâ€™s Pokhara region. The quake measured 7.9 magnitude on the Richter scale. Immediately, the scale of devastation became visible as people flooded social media with pictures of collapsed temples, towers and houses - and videos of people engaged in evacuation.

Prime Minister Narendra Modi was quick to offer help, speaking personally to Nepal President Ram Baran Yadan. He later spoke to Nepal Prime Minister Sushil Koirala, who was in Bangkok.President Pranab Mukherjee also wrote to his Nepali counterpart, offering all assistance for the restoration of normalcy and rehabilitation of victims.

By nightfall, four IAF planes landed in Kathmandu, carrying 50 tonnes of relief material, one mobile hospital, five sniffer dogs and over 250 National Disaster Relief Force (NDRF) personnel. They were conveyed on one C-13J super Hercules, one IL-76 and two C-17 Globemasters.

India will also send 10 helicopters on Sunday to assist in airlifting operations. Half of them will be based in Kathmandu and the rest in Pokhara. While eight of them will be Mi7s, there will also be two Dhruv choppers. The helicopters will help the force in rescue operations and food distribution.

Other wings of the government were also mobilised - railways dispatched one lakh mineral water bottles, BSNL/MTNL decided calls to Nepal to be charged at local rates while Power Ministry offered to send engineers to restore power grid in Nepal. Air India, as well as private airlines, including Indigo and Spicejet, offered to carry relief material free of charge.

An Army unit, which had gone on a cleaning mission to Mount Everest, went into rescue mode as it managed to retrieve bodies of 18 mountaineers at the base camp which was hit by an avalanche, post-quake.

Meanwhile, the Indian embassy is working round-the-clock to deal with the overwhelming number of enquiries it receives from desperate relatives in India.

255 Reach Delhi

As many as, 5 Indians, who managed to contact the Indian embassy, were brought back on the first evacuation flight (C-130J Hercules) at 10.30 pm from Nepal. The second one, carrying 200 more evacuees, reached Delhi around midnight.
