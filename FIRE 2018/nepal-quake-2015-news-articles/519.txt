Taipei, April 26 (CNA) The Taipei City Fire Department said on Sunday that its disaster response team is ready to leave for Nepal to help with search and rescue efforts in that country after it was hit by a magnitude-7.9 earthquake the previous day.



The 20-member Taipei City Urban Search and Rescue team, led by vice captain Chen Yung-an, will leave for Pokhara, Nepal's second-largest city located northwest to Kathmandu, as soon as it receives notification from the central government's National Fire Agency, the municipal fire department said.



The team will be equipped with 2 tons of relief equipment and medication to help with post earthquake search and rescue efforts in Nepal.



The team, the first of its kind in Taiwan to focus on urban relief work, was established in 1999 after a magnitude 7.3 earthquake that left 2,415 people dead and 29 missing.



The team has carried out several search and rescue missions at home and abroad since its formation, including in El Salvador (2001), Iran (2003), Indonesia (2004), Wenchuan, Sichuan Province, China (2008) and Haiti (2010).



According to the latest foreign wire service reports, the Nepal temblor has killed more than 1,800 and injured over 4,700.
