Dumaguete Diocese seeks more donations for Nepal quake victims
</headline>

CEBU, Philippines - The Diocese of Dumaguete iterated its call on parishioners to help victims of two successive major earthquakes in Nepal last week.

Dumaguete Bishop Julito Cortes said the Church has initiated the campaign to collect any amount from anybody who wanted to share their blessings, mercy and compassion to the victims of the Nepal earthquakes, which claimed the lives of about 9,000 and injured at least 19,000 more.

The second collection of donations was done last Sunday (May 10) and it will continue to this day and onward, said Cortes, adding that any amount solicited will be forwarded to the Catholic Bishops Conference of the Philippines in Manila, which will in turn hand it over to Caritas International and then to the Caritas in Nepal.

Cortes encouraged parishioners to continue helping those who are in need, through their respective parishes, but this time in cash because it would be impractical to send goods and in kind to the earthquake victims in that country.

Meanwhile, the repair and reconstruction of churches in the first district of Negros Oriental, which were damaged or destroyed by the 6.9 magnitude earthquake on February 6, 2012 is now going on.

Construction of a new church in Ayungon town was almost complete, while that of a new church in Tayasan and a bigger one in Jimamalud are now underway. The earthquake damaged these three churches and reconstruction was recommended on them instead of conducting repairs. In addition, the facade of the church in Bindoy had also undergone repair.
