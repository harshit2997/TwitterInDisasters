A plane carrying 120 Britons who were caught in the massive Nepal earthquake arrived in the UK on Thursday, April 30, a local media reported.

The media said that the plane, chartered by British Department for International Development (DFID), flew to Nepal to deliver relief supplies.

It said that on the return flight, Britons in Nepal were repatriated as passengers with children and those with health conditions were given priority status in the queue.

According to report, the youngest passenger was a three-month-old baby.

The British Foreign Secretary, Philip Hammond, said on Wednesday, April 29, that more than 300 Britons who had no accommodation in Nepal were being hosted by the British Embassy in Kathmandu.

"The Foreign Office staff will continue to work around the clock to trace British nationals and get them to safety in the wake of this catastrophe,’’ he said.

Hammond said hundreds of Britons in Nepal has now been accounted for and British rescue and medics teams are working closely with Nepalese army and authorities to locate British nationals in the more remote areas of the country and get them to safety.

Hammond added that the Briton who was confirmed dead on Wednesday was a resident of Hong Kong.
