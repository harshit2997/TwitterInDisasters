A Brentwood man has traveled halfway around the world to help victims of the devastating earthquake that shook Nepal on April 25.

Chuck Duby safely landed in Nepal on Friday to begin recovery and rebuilding efforts in the South Asia country, where more than 7,900 people were killed as a result of the magnitude-7.8 earthquake. Duby is a leading organizer for Hope Force International, a faith-based nonprofit that responds to natural disasters around the world.

Along with providing medical care, the HFI team also will give emotional and spiritual support to workers on the ground who are trying to help the more than 17,000 injured in the earthquake.

“One of our main aims is to relieve and cover the medical professionals who are already traumatized themselves and to give them a break,” Duby said last week before departing for Nepal. “For Nepal our objective is to staff and deploy medical teams. We will start initially in the suburbs of Kathmandu and then possibly go out to more rural areas.”

Duby is being joined by a medical team of nine volunteers during the two-week trip. In all, HFI has 1,300 trained volunteers in more than 40 states who are ready to be deployed to disaster areas domestically and abroad.

HFI also works closely with the Salvation Army as well as other international relief organizations.

Once the HFI team is able to assess the area, a second team may be sent based on what the need is for the region, he said.

“Our trip is going to be exploratory in a sense. You never know what’s really needed,” Duby said. “It’s a very stressful process to kind of pull something out of nothing and bring people from all over the country that have the skills and then go to a place like Nepal that is really beat up right now.”

After staying in the country’s capital, Kathmandu, on Friday, the team set out for the highly affected mountain villages of Sindhupalchok and Kavrepalanchok during the weekend.

“Surprisingly most of the city is intact, but the villages we will be working in were completely leveled,” HFI nurse Christi Kambs wrote on HFI’s Facebook page.

She added, “We are excited, nervous, heartbroken and every emotion in between.”

Duby was involved in service work for several decades before joining HFI. He has volunteered on the ground in the wake of several natural disasters, such as the 2010 earthquake in Haiti and also was in Sumatra after the 2004 tsunami.

No matter what scenario, Duby said the most important aspect for him is to mentally prepare the best he can.

“You definitely have to prepare mentally. Before I go on international trips I honestly feel extremely inadequate because you are putting your life in jeopardy to some degree,” he said. “You put yourself in harm’s way, so it’s kind of daunting to think about.”

Ultimately, Duby said his faith compelled him to take part in the trip and he hopes to provide as much aid as possible during the two-week response effort.

“I am a follower of Jesus, and I check in with him, and I have this sense that this was the right thing to move forward with.”
