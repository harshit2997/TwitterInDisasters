I'm so touched because all they care about is giving anything they have.

SYRACUSE, N.Y. -- The April 25 earthquake in Nepal left more than 5,000 people dead and leveled thousands of homes, schools and businesses. The death toll climbs higher with every passing day. With a magnitude of 7.8, it was the worst earthquake to strike the area in more than 80 years.

Syracuse is home to about 3,000 refugees who call Bhutan their motherland, but had been living for more than 20 years in camps in neighboring Nepal.

It's a complicated story. In 1989, the king of Bhutan began waging war on the Nepali people living in Bhutan, so they fled to the camps in Nepal. With help from local refugee agencies, thousands of these people now live in Syracuse, mostly on the North Side. Many Syracuse Bhutanese still have family and friends in Nepal.

Here are three ways to help.

1. Syracuse City School District

In the Syracuse City School District alone, approximately 446 Bhutanese students were born and educated in Nepalese refugee camps, as well as two district workers.

George Fowler High School

227 Magnolia St., Syracuse.

George Fowler High School currently takes donations for the Red Cross. The Nepali flag is flying at half mast below the school's American flag.

ESL teacher Dawn Kivlehan works with many of Fowler's Bhutanese/Nepali students, who were lined up in front of the ESL office door on Monday morning, ready to help.

"I'm so touched because all they care about is giving anything they have," said Kivlehan. "Raising awareness is part of the healing process for these kids."

Right away, students posted news clips on their private school Facebook group. A video of Fowler students singing the Nepali national anthem at school has almost 5,000 views on Facebook.

Students plan to sell 600 bracelets saying "Fowler loves Nepal" and wear traditional clothing this Friday.

Anyone can drop off a donation (cash or check) to the Fowler main office this week.

Dr. King Magnet Elementary School

416 E. Raynor Ave.

Staci Schaffer and Angela Salamino started a "Nickels for Nepal" drive at Dr. King Magnet Elementary School.

They are collecting change from students and staff this week to purchase phone cards for the Nepali families at King so they may contact family still living in that region.

Anyone can drop off donations at the Dr. King main office this week.

Institute Of Technology at Syracuse Central

258 E. Adams St.

Institute of Technology social studies teacher Stephanie Sobon and her students will host a bottle and can drive on Saturday, May 23 from 9 a.m. - 2 p.m. to raise money for the relief efforts.

2. InterFaith Works of CNY

InterFaith Works of CNY has settled many Bhutanese refugees in Syracuse. InterFaith Works of CNY and the Bhutanese Community of Syracuse partnered to raise donations to benefit the earthquake victims.



InterFaith Works will send all donations collected to be used for critical relief efforts and to rebuild hospitals and schools.

Anyone can drop off cash or send a check (with "Nepal earthquake donation" in the memo line) to InterFaith Works, 1010 James St. in Syracuse.

3. American Red Cross

The American Red Cross committed $1,000,000 and mobilizing disaster specialists to help provide emergency humanitarian assistance in Nepal. Efforts are part of a larger global Red Cross relief response, led by the Nepal Red Cross.

Eight American Red Cross disaster specialists are mobilized to support emergency relief, cash transfer programming, information management and recovery planning.

The Red Cross is also providing remote mapping and information management support and is arranging supplies from its warehouses in Kuala Lumpar and Dubai, including non-food items such as tarps, buckets, kitchen sets and blankets to be sent to Nepal.

You can drop off donations at the Red Cross in Syracuse at 344 W. Genesee St.
