China has dispatched three military helicopters to Nepal to help with rescue and relief missions, as it pledges to continue to support its neighbor.

China has already sent 186 tonnes of relief supplies, while a 70-strong chemical defense unit is working to prevent the spread of disease.

The 12308 global hotline -- set up this year to help Chinese citizens abroad -- has received 500 emergency calls requesting assistance for over 2,000 Chinese citizens affected by the quake.

In a regular press briefing, Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying summed up China's contribution to rescue and relief work after the quake.
