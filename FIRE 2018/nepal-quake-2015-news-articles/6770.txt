Maumee doctor returns from Nepal

Dr. Richard Paat and a team of 16 others, including emergency room doctors, anesthesiologists, and general surgeons went to the hardest hit areas of Nepal.

"We worked in a devastated school area," Dr. Paat said. "Right next to us, you could see the landslide where the two old schools were falling down."

They set up shop outside of the bigger cities.

At base camp they treated some 1,500 people, and 500 more in the remote mountain villages.

"They were getting upper respiratory infections and diarrheal disease because of the poor water supply and we were still treating more remnants of the earthquake," Dr. Paat told 13abc.

One of the more serious cases, was a 13-year-old with typhoid fever.

"He had a fever for 8 days. His father carried him down the mountain for an hour and a half," he said. "We gave him IV antibiotics and fluids and treated him."

After more than a week, treating patients, the team packed up and headed to Kathmandu University.

Then, without warning, a 7.3 magnitude earthquake hit.

"Everything starting shaking. The glass started falling, debris from the ceiling started falling down, so we pretty much high-tailed it out of there."

Dr. Paat says all of the team members made it out.

But the mountain locations where they walked and slept were in ruins again.

Though he is happy to be back home, he says the country will need continuing aid.

He's urging everyone to consider helping, in any way they can.
