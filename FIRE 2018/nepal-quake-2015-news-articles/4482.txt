The Foreign Ministry says its first aid and evacuation team will depart for Nepal on Wednesday evening.

'The first aid and evacuation team will depart this evening to Nepal, consisting of a medical team, food, tents and medicine. An Indonesian Air Force plane will return with the evacuated Indonesian nationals,' ministry spokesman Arrmanatha Nasir told reporters on Wednesday.

The team will remain in Nepal for one week at most, to help with relief efforts and evacuate the remaining Indonesians.

Arrmanatha said the authorities had contacted 35 out of 57 Indonesian tourists in the quake-ravaged Himalayan nation and reported that they were safe. Ten people were still unaccounted for. He added that the remaining 12 Indonesians had reportedly left Nepal and were on their way home.

Meanwhile, 13 out of the 19 Indonesians residing in Nepal have been reported safe while the whereabouts of the remaining six citizens remain unknown. (ebf)(+++)
