Kathmandu: The debris of a U.S. Marine Huey helicopter that disappeared during a relief mission in Nepal has been found near the place where it vanished.

The chopper carrying six Americans and two Nepalese service members vanished late Tuesday night. The UH-1Y Huey helicopter was on its way to deliver help to a district hit by the April 25 earthquake.

A massive search operation was started after the chopper disappeared near Charikot, Nepal. According to Pentagon officials there were no reports of smoke or a loud bang indicating that the aircraft crashed.

On Friday, Nepal's military informed that a search team had found the chopper in the district of Sindhupalchok. As a result, more search teams and helicopters were routed to the area. The U.S. military said that the team sent in to evaluate the debris had assessed it was the missing Huey.

According to the US army the chopper was found approximately 8 miles north of Charikot. In a statement U.S. Pacific Command said, "The assessment of the site is ongoing and a thorough investigation will be conducted."

While the names of anyone on board have not been revealed, the family of Chris Norgren from Kansas has confirmed that he was the pilot.
