New Delhi: Around 237 people are reported to have sustained injuries in the earthquake in India. According to the India Meteorological Department, tremors were felt in Bihar, Uttar Pradesh, Jharkhand, Rajasthan, Haryana, Delhi and Punjab, lasting for a minute, triggering panic and sending people rushing out of their homes and offices. “The earthquake was felt in the entire north India.

More intense shocks were observed in eastern UP and Bihar. Equally, it was felt in sub-Himalayan West Bengal and Himalayan West Bengal and Sikkim. Tremors, including 14 aftershocks, were also felt in entire north India, including Delhi, Jaipur, Dehradun and other cities,” IMD director-general L.S. Rathore said.

The government immediately swung into damage-control mode with Prime Minister Narendra Modi personally chairing a high-level meeting with his senior Cabinet colleagues to asses the situation. "We are in the process of finding more information and are working to reach out to those affected, both at home and in Nepal,” he tweeted immediately after tremors hit several places in India. The PM also spoke to Nepal President Ram Baran Yadav.
