Defence Secretary, Michael Fallon, has announced that a further 92 British Army Gurkha engineers will be supporting the relief effort in Nepal.

The additional military support will see the Kent-based Gurkhas provide direct welfare support to the villages of serving Gurkhas and their families, as well as Gurkha veterans. Military personnel will also provide immediate assistance to other Nepalese civilians in their Area of Operations.

Defence Secretary Mr Fallon, who is MP for Sevenoaks, said: “This further deployment of British Army Gurkhas to Nepal will provide welfare assistance for Ghurkha families, soldiers and veterans who have been affected by last month’s earthquake.

“The British Army Gurkhas deploying have a unique set of local knowledge, language skills and engineering experience, making them a vital element of the international response.

“We recognise that this terrible disaster will have directly affected our own Ghurkha community and our thoughts are with them at this difficult time.”

The contingent from 36 Engineer Regiment, based in Maidstone, will deploy in two stages and once in Nepal will make their way into the more remote hills. The first stage arrived on Friday 8 May and the second on Saturday 9 May.

Following the delivery of immediate care, the troops will construct permanent shelters and will assist in the repair of specific infrastructure. It is anticipated that they will be in Nepal for around three months.

The UK is playing a leading role in responding to the Nepal earthquake and is currently the largest donor to the relief operation, with our contribution now standing at more than £23 million. This includes funding for the provision of clean water and shelter for affected families, as well as the deployment of 30 trauma medics and humanitarian experts.
