Nepal Asks India, Other 33 Foreign Countries To Withdraw Rescue Workers

Eight days after a devastating earthquake hit the Himalayan country, Nepal has, on May 4, called off its search and rescue operation. Nepalese authorities reckon there can be no more survivors.

Information minister Minendra Rijal said the major rescue work in Kathmandu and surrounding areas have been completed and that the remaining operations can be handled by local workers. However, work remained in the villages and remote mountain areas and foreign aid volunteers could work with local police and army rescuers in those areas, he said.

Since the April 25 earthquake, 4,050 rescue workers from 34 different nations have flown to Nepal to help in rescue operations, provide emergency medical care and distribute food and other necessities. The death toll from the quake, Nepal's worst in more than 80 years, reached 7,276, police said.

Kathmandu authorities requested all the 34 countries involved in rescue operations in Nepal to call off their operations. Confirming this to the TOI, Vikas Swarup spokesperson of MEA said, "We have been asked to move to the next phase, that is, rehabilitation and reconstruction."

Nepal has requested India for equipments to remove the huge pile of rubble and help the country in its rehabilitation process.

Swarup said,"India would soon send heavy equipments in response to Nepalese demand. We are working closely with the civilian and military authorities in Nepal on the relief effort."

India, he said, was not acting unilaterally.

On May 3, Nepalese from across the world lobbied on social media to remove the Indian media from covering the disaster. They accused the Indian media of reporting insensitively with a humiliating degree of intrusiveness.
