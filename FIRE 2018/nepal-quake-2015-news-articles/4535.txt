Two 19-year-old Seattle women are still missing after a deadly earthquake in Nepal.

Bailey Meola and Sydney Schumacher were trekking in the Langtang Valley when the magnitude 7.8 quake hit last Saturday.

Bailey’s mother, Rachelle Brown, told KIRO Radio’s Ron and Don Show Tuesday the last time she talked to her daughter was minutes before she was boarding a bus that would take her to what is essentially the trail head.

“It’s not over until it’s over. Right now, we’re still trying to write their history,” Brown said. “We love our girls. We really do.”

The families are asking for help to raise money to help Bailey and Sydney in Nepal. As of Tuesday evening, an indiegogo account has raised more than $7,300.

Both women are experienced hikers, trained in first aid and CPR, according to Brown.

The girls have been traveling the world after graduating from Seattle’s Garfield High School in 2014.

“She did a 42 mile hike before she was in kindergarten,” Brown said about her daughter.

Both families have been in contact with U.S. State Department.

Joe DiCarlo with Nepal Quake Medical Teams International told Ron and Don it’s important these two families don’t give up hope.

“Communication is limited,” he said. “Keep seeking information about their daughters. Keep praying for a good outcome.”
