Watch NEPAL Emergency - Amateur Radio Stations helping at earthquake zone







In April 2012 Nepalâ€™s first amateur radio repeater was established by the National Society for Earthquake Technology (NSET). The 9N1KS repeater is located atop the NSET building on the southern outskirts of Kathmandu. Output is 145.000 MHz and input is 434.500 MHz with no tone.



A drill conducted in 2012 at several hospitals around the city suggested that coverage of the Kathmandu Valley was very good. It is reported there was regular evening activity by NSET staff, who had been using eight Yaesu FT-60s donated by CAN-USA.
