A senior official of the country's disaster management said Pakistan has planned to spend three to four million dollars of aid for the relief activities in Nepal.

Pakistan has already sent six transport C-130s flights loaded with initial relief consignments including tents, medicines and food items to Kathmandu.

Nepalese Ambassador to Pakistan Bharat Raj Paudyal said they are grateful to the government and people of Pakistan for generous support extended at this difficult time.

He said 35 districts of Nepal have been badly hit by the 7.9 magnitude earthquake on April 25.
