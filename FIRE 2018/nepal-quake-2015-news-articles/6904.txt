Telecom service provider Ncell has announced it will provide a financial assistance of Rs1 billion to the earthquake victims.

In a press release, the telecom oprator said its parent company Teliasonera will also provide $1million (Rs102.9 million) for the purpose.

Ncell claimed it has provided free call and SMS services worth Rs 1.59 billion in 10 days after the first quake hit the country on April 25. “We are continuing our communication relief in various districts,” said Ncell Chief Executive Officer Erim Taylanlar. In addition, Telias-onera handed over $70,000 (Rs7.2 million) to Red Crosss Sweden to assist the relief programme in Nepal. Teliaso-nera staffers contributed half of the amount, it said.

The company said it plans to invest Rs2 billion to build earthquake resistant data centre in Kathmandu. It would also continue its services soon in Dolakha and Sindhupalchok among other areas where the service has been disrupted.

Meanwhile, the Ncell CEO claimed the company did not have any deliberate intention to evade tax after Red Cross stickers were found pasted on commercial consignments of Ncell.
