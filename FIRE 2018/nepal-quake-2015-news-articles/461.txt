LONDON, April 25 (Xinhua) -- Britain has deployed a team of humanitarian experts to Nepal to provide urgent support to those affected by Saturday's earthquake, the BBC said on Saturday.

The eight-strong team, which includes experts in search and rescue, will travel to Nepal overnight.

The 7.8-magnitude quake struck just before midday local time and is thought to have killed more than 1,000 people.

Prime Minister David Cameron had said the UK would do all it could to help in the aftermath of the earthquake.
