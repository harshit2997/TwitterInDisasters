Two hundred seventeen people are missing in Mount Everest region, according to ministry officials. Twenty-two bodies have been recovered from the quake triggered avalanche site in the Mount Everest base camp.

Thirty-two people have been rescued from the region, while 29 are being treated at the Lukla Hospital.

Suresh Acharya, joint secretary at the Tourism Ministry, said they were airlifted by five rescue helicopters.

The avalanche swept through a resting point of climbers, guides and porters during the climbing season. Last year 13 people were killed due to an avalanche.
