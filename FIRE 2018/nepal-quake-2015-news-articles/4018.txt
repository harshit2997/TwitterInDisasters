RBAF Joins SAF to Provide Assistance to Nepal
</headline>

<text>
Two Republic of Singapore Air Force (RSAF) C-130 aircraft returned from Nepal last night. Two more RSAF C-130 aircraft departed for Kathmandu this morning at about 5am and 11am respectively.

On board the aircraft were sustenance and medical supplies, six additional SAF personnel from the Changi Regional Humanitarian Assistance and Disaster Relief Coordination Centre (RHCC) and eight personnel from the Royal Brunei Armed Forces (RBAF).

The additional RHCC personnel will augment the RHCC team that is already on the ground assisting the Nepalese disaster management authorities and military in coordinating the relief effort.

The RBAF personnel will join the SAF medical team deployed to Gokarna town. Both armed forces will work alongside in providing medical assistance to the earthquake victims there. The deployment of RBAF personnel was coordinated through the Brunei international liaison officer to the RHCC, and demonstrates the excellent defence ties between the SAF and RBAF.
