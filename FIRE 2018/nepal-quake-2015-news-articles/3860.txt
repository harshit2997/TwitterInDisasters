Healesville newlyweds Kent Highgate and Karen O’Brien found safe in Nepal

THE DAUGHTER of a Healesville man caught up in the Nepal earthquake has described her joy at the news her dad is safe.

The family of newlyweds Kent Highgate, 56, and Karen O’Brien, 53, received a text message from the couple’s trekking company last night.

Mr Highgate’s daughter Cherie said she was “rapt” with the news.

However, she is still waiting on a direct text message or phone call from her father and stepmother.

“I was sitting there and the message came through and I almost jumped,” Ms Highgate said.

“We’ve been so worried — it felt like our world had just stopped.”

Ms Highgate said her family were sent into a panic upon hearing the news of the earthquake, which struck Kathmandu on the weekend and has killed at least 4600 people.

“We didn’t have an itinerary and we were so worried because we knew they were in Nepal but we didn’t know the times or dates,” she said.

A fellow trekker has told the Highgates their father and stepmother were sitting at a cafe when the earth began to shake.

‘They ran outside, it would have been absolutely terrifying,” Ms Highgate said.

The couple planned to return to Melbourne next week but their family are now unsure of their plans.

Mr Highgate is an ex-army office and both he and Ms O’Brien are trained in emergency response, leading the family to believe they may stay in Nepal to assist with the clean-up.

“We still don’t know what their exit strategy will be,” Ms Highgate said.

“But when they get home I’ll definitely be giving them a hug and a kiss, and then telling them that next time they can’t go anywhere, not even around the block, without leaving a note.”
