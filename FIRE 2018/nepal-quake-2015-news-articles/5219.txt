Robert Pattinson and FKA Twigs stepped out together for the second time this week, attending Wednesday’s “Benefit for the People of Nepal.” See photos below.

The event was held at Largo at the Coronet in Los Angeles, where Judd Apatow hosted a stand-up show. He was joined by comedians Bill Burr, Bo Burnham, and Jerrod Carmichael. Among the other celebrities in attendance were Jennifer Lawrence and Chris Martin. Proceeds from the evening helped the Los Angeles chapter of the Red Cross raise funds to aid earthquake-ravaged Nepal.

The outing was Pattinson and Twigs’ second date night in three days. As Gossip Cop reported, the couple attended Monday’s Metropolitan Museum of Art Costume Institute Gala in New York City together, where they posed together on the red carpet for the very first time. It was also both stars’ at the glamorous event, where dozens and dozens of top celebrities came out for what is considered fashion’s biggest night.

Twigs’ Met Ball dress memorably featured body parts, including an eyebrow-raising penis (see photo above). Her engagement ring from Pattinson was also clearly visible for the first time since it was confirmed they are planning to wed. On Tuesday, the couple left New York to fly to Los Angeles together, the same day it was announced Twigs was nominated for four Libera Awards.
