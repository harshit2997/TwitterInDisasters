The Chinese people know the destruction and sorrow natural disasters bring, with the 2008 Wenchuan earthquake lingering painfully in the memories of many.

The Chinese also know what outside aid and rescuers mean to desperate people trapped under collapsed buildings. More than 170 countries and 20 international organizations donated to China, and a dozen international professional rescue and medical teams came to help that year.

China lost no time in sending rescue teams and relief supplies to Nepal following an 8.1-magnitude earthquake that struck the Himalayan country on Saturday and killed more than 6,000 people.

Just after the quake, Chinese President Xi Jinping and Premier Li Keqiang sent messages of condolence to Nepalese leaders for the disaster, offering their sympathies and support.

As of Friday, China has earmarked two rounds of humanitarian aid worth 60 million yuan (US$9.7 million) for Nepal.

A 62-member Chinese search and rescue team was among the first to reach quake-hit areas in Nepal, bringing much-needed hope and life-saving equipment. Members have experience in dozens of international and domestic earthquake rescue missions, including those for the 2008 Wenchuan quake and the earthquakes in Japan, Haiti and Pakistan.

The Chinese military dispatched troops and aircraft, including four Ilyushin IL-76 transport planes, to assist rescue efforts and a helicopter to save trapped Chinese citizens at a hydropower station construction site in Nepal.

Zhou Yongsheng, an international relations professor at China Foreign Affairs University, said he was impressed by China's coordinated evacuation of Chinese citizens and its quick response when sending help.

"An old Chinese saying goes, 'When disaster strikes, help comes from all sides.' But in the past, China was powerless to give more than it could provide, though it had the heart to do so," said Zhou.

Now, the world's second-largest economy is more willing and capable to help. Aside from government-backed aid, China's non-government organizations, including foundations and rescue teams, also joined in the efforts. Chinese Internet giant Tencent donated two million yuan and real estate developer Wanda Group donated five million yuan.

Commenting on China's aid efforts, Nepal's Ambassador to China Mahesh Kumar Maskey said, "A friend in need is a friend indeed. Nepali people will always remember the support and help from China."
