KENMORE, N.Y. (WIVB) — Families in western New York are worried about their loved ones in Nepal. The earthquake that struck on Saturday has now claimed more than 4,000 lives.

Search crews in the country’s capital are working non-stop to find survivors.

Many here in WNY are trying desperately to reconnect with loved ones. There are more than 2,000 people in the Bhutanese-Nepali community in our region, according to the International Institute of Buffalo.

Kenmore resident Bishnu Kapri watched on television as the massive magnitude 7.8 earthquake ripped apart the city where he was born.

“I’m looking at the TV thinking ‘No, this is not true, this is not happening’,” said Kapri. “All of the houses trembling, leaning sideways, all the brick falling down on the ground. Real live people are there and I said ‘Oh my god, no’.”

Six hours later Kapri finally learned his mother, grandfather and other relatives are okay. His mother lives in Kathmandu but his grandfather is still in the village where Kapri grew up, near the earthquake’s epicenter in Gorkha.

“My village has about 300 homes and all of them are gone, right on the ground,” said Kapri. “Not one house is standing up.”

People there are now struggling to find food and clean water. Kapri told News 4 his family members described going into the jungle to find food.

He lost contact with his family on Sunday and said conditions in Nepal will continue to get more desperate.

“The worst thing that is happening right now is the earthquake may be finished but the heavy rain is coming down,” said Kapri. “They have nowhere to go.”

Monsoon season just started and will last into the summer.

Kapri said, however, it’s lucky that the earthquake struck during the day while people were out of their homes.

“All of my family members are okay, that’s important to me,” said Kapri. “The material things, we’ll build tomorrow.”
