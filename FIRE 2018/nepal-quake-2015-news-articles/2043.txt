Aid for Nepal: How You Can Help Earthquake Victims
</headline>

<text>
U.S. disaster relief teams are expected to arrive in Nepal today following the 7.8-magnitude earthquake that impacted almost 5 million people and killed over 4,000.

In Kathmandu, rescue teams have been digging through rubble, looking for anyone who might still be alive. At the same time, aid groups have yet to reach many remote mountain villages, but reports suggest that some communities perched on mountainsides were devastated or struggling to cope.

Here are some ongoing relief and rescue efforts to help the victims of the earthquake:

GlobalGiving's Nepal Earthquake Relief Fund

GlobalGiving said it is providing emergency supplies including food, water and shelter to victims through a network of local Nepalese nonprofits and international aid organizations.
