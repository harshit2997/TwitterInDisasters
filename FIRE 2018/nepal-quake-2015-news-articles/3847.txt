Report: More than five-thousand people are estimated to have died as a result of the massive earthquake in Nepal. As of Wednesday morning, an additional 11-thousand are said to be injured, with more than 450-thousand displaced from their homes.



Healthcare facilities have become overwhelmed, resulting in lines of victims waiting to receive medical attention.



Meanwhile aftershocks continue to rumble, causing further damage to the quake-ravaged nation.



A hotel crumbled to the ground in the central Nepalese district of Gorkha, one of the closest districts to the epicenter of last Saturday's quake. Meanwhile, at a nearby village, some 250 are missing following a landslide.



Rescue workers from around the world are stepping up efforts to locate the missing. On Tuesday, they located a 28-year-old man who had been buried for 80 hours since the quake hit the South Asian nation.



A ten-member Korea Disaster Response Team and a five-member advance team arrived in Kathmandu Tuesday afternoon.



After consulting with local disaster management authorities, the workers launched rescue activities in Bhaktapur, located some 15 kilometers east of the Nepalese capital, Kathmandu. South Korea will send a total of 40 emergency personnel to the quake-devastated nation.



The Nepalese government has designated a national period of mourning through Thursday.
