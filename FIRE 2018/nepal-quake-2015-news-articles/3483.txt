Candlelight vigil for Nepal after deadly earthquake
</headline>

<text>
SEVERAL hundred people gathered in Franklin Square yesterday evening to remember those who lost their lives in the Nepal earthquake, and to pray for the survivors.

The candlelight vigil, organised by University of Tasmania Nepalese students, was also a chance to raise money for the relief effort.

“We wanted to give the message to the community that we are very sad and we are in agony,” Nepalese PhD student Aarati Khanal said.

“We really needed a way to vent our emotions and remember the departed ones and pray for the wellbeing of the survivors,” she said.

“Things are really scary and sad back home and Nepal can never rise on its own; we need help from outside.”

Ms Khanal said she was unable to contact her family in Pokhara for 24 hours after the earthquake hit, which she said was the toughest experience of her life.

“They are OK but they could not sleep inside the house ... it was hard to go to bed and sleep in a comfortable bed knowing that your family are outside in the cold and not being able to talk to them was very hard,” she said.

Ms Khanal said some of her friends at the university had lost family members.

The Tasmania University Law Society is holding a bake sale at the Law Faculty next Thursday from noon-2pm to raise money for the relief effort in Nepal, with all proceeds going to the Red Cross.

“We didn’t just want people to come and donate, we wanted to do something different,” the society’s vice president, Dinesh Loganthan, said.
