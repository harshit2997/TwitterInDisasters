Super Smash Bros. Live Stream Raises Money For Nepal Earthquake Relief
</headline>

<text>
Super Smash Bros. Invitational participant and live streamer Neha "Lilo" Chhetri raised over $4,000 dollars for Nepal earthquake relief with the help of her fans, viewers, and others in the Smash community.

Chhetri, herself born and raised in Nepal, hosted a nine hour donation stream on her Twitch channel, streaming Super Smash Bros. Melee and chatting with other competitive players.

She set just $1,000 as the initial goal, but ended up raising four times that: $4,080.08 to be exact.

All donations were given to general relief for those affected by the 7.8 magnitude earthquake that hit Nepal on April 25th.

The quake's epicenter hit near Lamjung, Nepal less than two weeks ago, triggering a deadly avalanche on Mount Everest, leveling several towns and temples, and killing over 7,000 people.

Video game charities aren't uncommon for live streamers or let's players.

Recently, a YouTuber decided to donate Â£1 to leukemia and lymphoma research every time he died in Bloodborne.

Then there's the Awesome Games Done Quick series of charity speedruns, which always raises a ton of money for cancer research and other funds.
