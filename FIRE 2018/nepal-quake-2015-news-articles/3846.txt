A Kelowna based relief agency is providing resources to aid in the aftermath of the 7.8 magnitude earthquake in Nepal.

Hope for the Nations helps marginalized children in 21 countries with access to nutritious food and clean water, health care, safe living conditions, and an education.

Twenty years ago, the organization built its first home in Kathmandu, which allowed it to partner with local organizations. Today, HOPE has developed many projects and partnerships in Nepal.

Following Saturday’s quake, the worst to hit Nepal in nearly a century, thousands have died and many more were injured.

Patricia Phillips, the program director for HOPE, says the organization has led with support and resources during natural disasters around the world, and she's confident it can provide assistance in Nepal.

"HOPE plans to assist in two phases. First, to provide for basic needs by helping to gather food and water, and secondly, to assist in the rebuilding of this beautiful country.”

Many people are being forced to sleep outdoors in the cold for fear of aftershocks causing more damage to the buildings. Resources are scarce as food and water are becoming increasingly hard to come by, says Phillips.

“Right now, HOPE is responding to the disaster by raising funds to send to our partners to mobilize relief to their communities. One is a network of 20 churches, and others have strong relationships in their local communities. But we still need more help.”
