KATHMANDU - The first rescue plane carrying people injured in an earthquake-triggered avalanche that ripped through tents on Mount Everest arrived in Kathmandu on Sunday shortly before a strong aftershock rocked India and Nepal and triggered more snowfalls.

Nepal's worst earthquake in 81 years, at 7.9 magnitude, killed at least 1,900 people on Saturday including at least 17 climbers on Everest.

Survivors on Everest described a cloud of rock and ice that smashed into base camp, and many climbers were still on the mountain when an aftershock triggered a new series of avalanches on Sunday. There were no immediate reports of more casualties.

"Another big one. Really big. Rockfall off surrounding peaks in North Side #everest base camp. Worst possible news for south," climber Adrian Ballinger posted on Twitter.

The 6.7 magnitude aftershock felt as far away as Delhi also set off an avalanche on nearby Mount Makalu, the world's firth highest peak.

"Another one, we have an aftershock right now. Oh shit," said Indian climber Arjun Vajpai, talking by phone from Makalu base camp. "Avalanche," he shouted.

Shouts and the roar of crashing snow could be heard as he spoke. Vajpai said he survived the latest avalanche but that it was closer to camp than earlier snowfalls.

The survivors flown down from Everest included three from China, Japan, and South Korea. Several of the injured had bandages on their heads, one spotted with blood and all were able to walk.

Tourism ministry officials estimated that at least 1,000 climbers, including about 400 foreigners, had been at base camp or on the ascent to the peak when the earthquake struck.

The Saturday avalanche buried part of base camp and swept away tents as climbers gathered near the main route to the summit at the beginning of the climbing season in the deadliest incident on the mountain.
