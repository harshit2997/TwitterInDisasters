Aid agencies struggle to determine Nepal’s needs

LONDON — As world leaders and global charities tried to grasp the scope of an earthquake that devastated Nepal, they offered condolences for the nearly 1,400 people killed and readied emergency aid for the survivors. Mountaineering groups struggled to check on climbers, and Nepalese abroad did their best to reach families in the stricken area.

With Internet and cellphone communications spotty, and many roads closed due to damage, the outside world was having a difficult time determining what was most needed following the magnitude.

Charities assembled disaster teams but the most convenient pathway into Nepal was not available because the international airport in Kathmandu was shut down.

Doctors Without Borders said four teams would leave Sunday morning for Nepal from India, close to the Nepal border. The organization also is sending in 3,000 medical kits. A 62-member Chinese search and rescue team that includes six dogs was expected to arrive in Kathmandu midday Sunday by chartered plane, the country’s state-run Xinhua News Agency reported, citing the China Earthquake Administration.

The United States was sending a disaster response team and $1 million in aid, according to Secretary of State John Kerry.
