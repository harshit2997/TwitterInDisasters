From one of our friends & Ball Project partners in Kathmandu:

Dear brother, thank you for your prayer. Till now, I have not heard any critical news among CSF team . In general , the country is suffering really bad. Lalitpur, the city where I live, only 73 people died till now and thousands injured.

My elder brother R broke his leg when jumped out from the terrace of office building at the factory. He is in the hospital right now. All my family are fine.

7.8 major earth quake this morning. Many more disaster news are coming from many places of the country.

Please keep continue praying for the our beloved nation’s many families who lost their lives.
