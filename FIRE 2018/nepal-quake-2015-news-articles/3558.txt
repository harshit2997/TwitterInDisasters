NZ increases aid to Nepal

Foreign Minister Murray McCully has announced that New Zealand will make a further contribution of $1million to assist Nepal as it responds to the ANZAC Day earthquake.

“The $1 million announced today will support accredited New Zealand non-government organisations, with partners on the ground in Nepal, on a matched-funding basis,” Mr McCully says.

“New Zealanders have been giving generously to the appeals established by aid agencies and the Government’s commitment will help match this generosity dollar for dollar up to a value of $1 million.

“The extra funding brings our total contribution to date to $2 million, and it will allow aid agencies to scale up the distribution of relief items and early recovery work.

“New Zealand’s funding has already supported the deployment of an Emergency Response Unit by the New Zealand Red Cross. This three person team will help establish local communication networks to assist the relief operation.

“We are also providing support to the Himalayan Trust, established by Sir Edmund Hillary in 1960, with their earthquake ‘rebuild appeal.’ The work of the Trust will have a specific focus on repairing schools that have been affected by the earthquake.

“We remain committed to helping the people of Nepal in these difficult times and will continue to assess how we can assist further,” Mr McCully says.
