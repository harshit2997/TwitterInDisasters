May 12 - Massive earthquake strikes Nepal at midday

News from Nepal (1:30 pm ET)

•In addition to the earthquake and aftershocks, heavy rains are causing landslides, making transportation very difficult and hampering access to affected populations.

•Our teams in hard-hit Rasuwa and Nuwakot are tallying the local population's needs. Handicap international is on standby to send additional equipment, and to organize distributions as soon as roads are cleared.

•The districts of Sindhulpalchok and Dolkha are the worst affected. There are no orthopedic services there, and the injured people will probably be evacuated to Kathmandu.

•Handicap International is particularly worried by the situation in Kathmandu, as newly-wounded people arrive in hospitals that are already overflowing. It is likely that victims of the April 25th earthquake who were still recovering in hospital will be discharged in order to admit new patients. We will ensure that these people are followed-up, by registering them as they leave hospital and ensuring that they receive the help they need, particularly in terms of post-trauma emergency rehabilitation. This is vital to help them avoid long-term disabilities or other complications.

•For people injured by this recent earthquake, the coming hours will be dedicated to first aid and emergency surgery. Our teams in Kathmandu are ready to provide post-surgical care starting Wednesday morning.

•In the wake of the April 25th earthquake, we provided hospitals with mobility aids and equipment which can be used for the victims of the second earthquake.

•People are afraid to return home as aftershocks rattle the buildings. Handicap International plans to distribute basic needs kits and tents in areas around the hospitals.

Hitting at midday local time, the day was in full swing and Handicap International's 84-person team was working with and for victims of the previous earthquake when the earth shook. The teams were managing, among other things, distributions of basic needs kits, and were providing care to the injured. They are all safe.

Numerous aftershocks are still rattling Nepal, making transportation difficult. The teams are planning rapid assessments of this latest earthquake's impact in the following areas where our teams are deployed: Rasuwa, Nuwakot, Banepa, Kavre and Katmandu.

The Nepalese people are still traumatized from the April 25 earthquake. Our teams responded to that earthquake within a few hours of the disaster, and have helped several hundred people since.
