More than 100 residents of Mumbra donated blood at a blood camp organised by All India Majlis-E-Ittehadul Muslimeen party of Mumbra towards Nepal relief.



Considering the intensity of the natural calamity and its aftereffects, AIMIM of Mumbra decided to do some bit towards Nepal quake victims. A blood donation drive was organised in co-ordination with Red Cross – international blood bank.



Byculla MLA Waris Pathan and AIMIM Thane's district president Zubair Shaikh were present at the occasion and participated in the blood donation drive. “Earthquake is something which cannot be predicted. Since many people have got injured, we are trying our best to do something from our side. We have organised various such camps at different places.” The money was collected at Aurangabad and clothes were collected in Nagpur by MIM party members.



Imran Khan, resident of Mumbra and a proud blood donor, said, “After watching quake victims, I felt very helpless. This blood donation drive came along, and I thought of doing my bit.” Another resident Hassan Mulani, who is a professor, added that many think of donating various things, but blood is one such thing, which is the most required. “There's a scarcity of blood at Nepal as thousands have been injured and so i thought of donating blood,” he said.
