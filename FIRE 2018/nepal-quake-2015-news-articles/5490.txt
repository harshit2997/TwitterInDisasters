University suspends undergraduate travel to Nepal
</headline>

<text>
In response to the earthquake in Nepal, the University announced in an email on Wednesday that it will not fund any undergraduate travel to the country due to health concerns. Still, Provost John Coatsworth encouraged that members of the University continue to support those affected by the earthquake through community efforts.

Here's the email in full:

The University remains deeply concerned for the people of Nepal and continues to monitor events there. In the days since the earthquake, initial speculation about the human and physical scale of the disaster has been confirmed, and we see clearly the need for a sustained and determined response. Thank you to those members of the Columbia community who have supported relief efforts both here and abroad.We have been advised by our medical and evacuation assistance provider International SOS (ISOS) that Nepal is unsafe for scholastic travel. This corresponds both with the U.S. Department of State’s Travel Warning and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s warning that recommend that non-essential travel be deferred. With these warnings in mind, all undergraduate travel to Nepal that uses university funding, earns university credit, or satisfies university requirements is prohibited. Other members of the community may continue to travel to the country as planned, but we may need to issue further restrictions should conditions worsen or should ISOS’s capability for evacuation become compromised. These travelers must register their itinerary with ISOS. You may contact Laura Schon, Director of Risk Management, at lschon@columbia.edu for details about how to do this. Further details will be posted atpreparedness.columbia.edu as they become available.
