Slovenia's government will offer 50,000 euros (about 56,000 U.S. dollars) in direct financial aid to quake-stricken Nepal, Prime Minister Miro Cerar announced here on Wednesday.

Noting that the emergency aid will be provided through the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF), Cerar said Slovenia is willing to help Nepal in other forms, including the deployment of a medical team to Nepal.

A powerful earthquake, measuring 7.9 on the Richter scale, struck central Nepal on Saturday, having killed more than 5,000 people, and injured a total of 10,915 others, according to official reports.

The death toll could rise further as rescue efforts continue in the country. Endit
