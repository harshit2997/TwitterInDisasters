Parliament on Thursday endorsed a special motion on the loss of more than seven thousand lives and the massive damaged caused by the devastating earthquake.

The House wished for speedy recovery of more than 14,000 people who have sustained injuries. The meeting also passed a note of sorrow on the destruction of valuable world heritage sites.

President Ram Baran Yadav, on the recommendation of Prime Minister Sushil Koirala, had summoned Parliament to discuss the national crisis.

The House also endorsed a condolence message on the demise of former lawmaker Chakra Bahadur Thakuri who died in a landslide triggered by the quake on his way back from Nuwakot on April 25.

The next meeting of Parliament has been scheduled for Friday, where the government is preparing to table a special motion highlighting its policy on relief, reconstruction and rehabilitation. Both the ruling and opposition parties are holding discussions for finalising the contents of the motion. In Fridayâ€™s meeting, top leaders of the parties represented in Parliament will express their opinions about the devastation.

After the Parliament meeting, CPN-UML leader Madhav Kumar Nepal said the government should bring a concrete rehabilitation and reconstruction plan. He charged that the government had failed to address the woes of the quake-affected people, mainly in rural areas.

Senior Nepali Congress leader Sher Bahadur Deuba said it is time for all the parties to unite and provide relief packages to the needy. He informed that the parties were working to bring a concrete policy to respond to the disaster.

Meanwhile, the Constituent Assembly meeting called for Friday has been postponed by a week as lawmakers would remain busy in Parliament. The government plans to conclude the House session within a week and make preparations for the budget session.
