Nepal has been hit again with yet another very powerful earthquake that has killed dozens of people while possibly leaving 1,000 more injured.

Now, it is being reported that a U.S. helicopter sent to help those in need has gone missing, with still no sign of it or its eight crew members over 24 hours later.

CNN reports that this latest quake was a magnitude 7.3 as it struck approximately 9.3 miles deep, according to the U.S. Geological Survey. The earlier quake that hit on April 25 was a magnitude 7.8. It was more than three times bigger and 5.6 times stronger in terms of the energy released, according to the USGS.

A U.S. military helicopter that is part of the Marine Light Attack Helicopter Squadron 469 was dispatched to help the earthquake victims. U.S. defense officials said that it was carrying six Marines and two Nepalese Army soldiers.

The Huey was conducting disaster relief operations near Charikot, Nepal, around 9:00 a.m. EDT on Tuesday, according to Navy Capt. Chris Sims. At this time, there have been no indications that the helicopter has crashed.

An Indian helicopter that was in the air around the same time heard talk on the radio that there was a possible fuel problem, according to U.S. Army Col. Steve Warren. They Huey had already dropped some supplies to one location and was on its way to a second location when it lost contact. He said officials are hopeful for a good ending to this as there has been no smoke or other signs of a crash.

Warren said that other U.S. aircraft had searched the area where the Huey lost contact, but overnight, the Nepalese military were being forced to conduct their search on foot. He said they were moving in a direction toward the second location that it was headed to, to see if it landed somewhere near there.
