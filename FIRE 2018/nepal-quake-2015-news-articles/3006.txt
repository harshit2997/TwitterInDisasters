North Muskegon couple OK after Nepal quake

GRAND RAPIDS, Mich. (WOOD) — A West Michigan married couple who were in Nepal when the magnitude 7.8 earthquake rocked the Himalayan nation on Saturday are safe.

As of Tuesday, nearly 5,000 were feared dead as a result of thequake and the number of injured was in the tens of thousands. Tens of thousands were also homeless.

Craig and Cathy Simons are a retired couple from North Muskegon. Their travels put them in Nepal a couple of days before the earthquake hit.

Craig Simons told 24 Hour News 8 over the phone on Tuesday that they hiked to the Mount Everest Base Camp on Saturday morning. They had breakfast there and had nearly returned to their hotel when the ground began shaking so hard they could barely stand.

The earthquake caused an avalanche on Mount Everest, killing at least 18, and flattened buildings around the poor, mountainous country.

Craig and Cathy Simons made it through the disaster unscathed and have taken shelter in the U.S. embassy in Nepal’s capital city of Kathmandu.

“Probably the worst was after, being in the building and we had several quakes after. They were more than a tremor. One was registered at 6.9, I believe. It really shook the building. Everybody was on the second floor and running down the stairs like their life depends on it. That went on for two days,” Craig Simons told 24 Hour News 8.

Simons said most people are staying outside, afraid to go indoors in case there are any more aftershocks.

Relief planes and helicopters have been flying in supplies, but the number of planes has crowded the only runway in the area. The Simons say they hope to fly out in the next couple of days if their flight can get out.
