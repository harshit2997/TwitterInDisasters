AUSTRALIANS stranded in Nepal will be flown out of the country by the air force as the government vows to continue the search for those still missing.

While some Australians have returned home on commercial flights, others are waiting for the Department of Foreign Affairs to release details of the military flights when arrangements at Kathmandu airport have been made.

Consular officials have contacted more than 1150 Australians who are safe in Nepal.

Melbourne woman Renu Fotedar is the first Australian identified as having died in the quake, in an avalanche at the Mount Everest base camp on Sunday caused by a 6.7 magnitude aftershock, while it's believed up to 200 remain unaccounted for.

"We will continue to search for any Australians who are unaccounted for," Foreign Affairs Minister Julie Bishop said.

Ms Fotedar's family are in Kathmandu where they are receiving consular assistance.

The death toll from the quake rose to 4310 on Tuesday, with a further 8000 people known to have been injured.

Australia is adding $1 million to its immediate aid to Nepal, bringing its total contribution to $6 million. AAP
