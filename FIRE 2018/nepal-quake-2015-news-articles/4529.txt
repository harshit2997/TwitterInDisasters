Six firefighters from Cheshire Fire and Rescue have arrived in Nepal to help rescue efforts there.

Search and Rescue dog handler Steve Buckley was the first to arrive. He's joined up with the UK's International Search and Rescue Team in Kathmandu, who are helping the victims of the earthquake in the country, along with rescue dog Bryn.

The other five, Mark Coleman, Alexander Hayes, Stuart Devereux, John Turner, and Daz Tennant (pictured below) arrived in the country shortly after.

They'd initially had to wait over the border in India. Transport is extremely difficult due to the damage the earthquake has caused to infrastructure.

The team will provide specialised technical search and rescue assistance in collapsed buildings. This includes locating and rescuing people deeply entrapped, search dog support, medical support, engineering, assessing damage and stabilising scenes.

A spokesperson for the team said: “Our volunteer members train hard and are fully prepared to help in whatever way they can with the rescue efforts. These are highly-skilled firefighters and staff from UK fire and rescue services, and specialist doctors and paramedics.

They will be giving their all to help the Nepalese during these catastrophic events. It will be extremely challenging work, and we are giving them and their families every support possible.”

They join a team of nearly 70 volunteers, drawn from UK fire and rescue services and health trusts, which has been deployed by the Department for International Development (DfID).
