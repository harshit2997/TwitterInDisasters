Sixteen Kuwaitis evacuated from quake stricken Nepal – Embassy made sure nationals not affected

KUWAIT: Kuwait’s Ambassador to India and non-resident Ambassador to Nepal Sami Mohammad Al-Suleiman confirmed that the Kuwaiti embassy made sure that no nationals were affected by the devastating earthquake in Nepal. “In coordination with the competent authorities in Nepal and under the directives of the Kuwaiti Foreign Ministry, the embassy evacuated 16 nationals from the quake-hit areas and sent them back to Kuwait to ensure their safety,” Al-Suleiman told KUNA. He thanked the embassies in Kathmandu of the two sisterly countries Saudi Arabia and Qatar for their cooperation with a Kuwaiti diplomat tasked with the evacuation mission.

The 7.9-magnitude quake on Saturday, April 25, left nearly 5,000 deaths and scores of injured people in addition to large-scale destruction across Nepal. In response to the catastrophe, the Kuwaiti cabinet on Monday set aside USD three million in emergency aid for the victims of the quake Nepal and its neighbors at the behest of His Highness the Amir Sheikh Sabah Al-Ahmad Al-Jaber Al-Sabah. The delivery of the assistance, including foodstuffs and medical supplies, is supervised by the embassy and Kuwait Red Crescent Society. —KUNA
