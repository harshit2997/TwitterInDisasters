Father raises money to rebuild Nepalese villages
</headline>

A father who helped build a village in Nepal is raising money to help people there cope with the “devastating” effects of the earthquake.

David John, of Leslie Road, East Finchley, has already raised £5,000 via his GoFundMe page to help rebuild the village of Arkhaule.

Last month, an earthquake with a magnitude of 7.8 struck the country, killing more than 7,500 people. A second earthquake struck yesterday, killing 48 and injuring 1,000.

Mr John, a voice actor who has had roles in Dr Who, has been visiting Nepal with his friends for years, where he befriended the Singh family.

Together he helped them build the village of Shivapuri, near the Himalayas, and although it was unaffected by the tragedy, the neighbouring town of Arkhaule was left destroyed.

He said: “I just wanted to do something quickly and the response has been fantastic. I have had donations from people I’ve never heard of - an anonymous donor gave £500.

“It’s just amazing. That kind of money can really rebuild a village even if it doesn’t seem like a lot to us in England.

“The earthquake was devastating.”

The money raised will also go towards supporting one-year-old Hemanta Tamang and his father, Kali, after their mother and wife, Maya, was killed in the tragedy.

It will also support baby Suchi, who was born to parents Puja and Anil in a tent while the chaos of the earthquake unfolded.

Mr John, a single father who lives with his son, Oliver, ten, said nobody has been able to reach the villages to help them.

He added: “We need to rebuild the villages near Shivapuri before the monsoon kicks off in July.

“People in Nepal are so warm and friendly. They love the British and they are so grateful for all of our help.”
