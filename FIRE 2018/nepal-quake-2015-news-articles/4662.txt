More vital UK aid reaches Nepal
</headline>

<text>
Latest flights have delivered much-needed aid into Kathmandu.

An RAF C-17 aircraft and 2 commercial transport aircraft have arrived in Nepal delivering crucial water purification equipment, shelter and medical supplies, International Development Secretary Justine Greening has announced.

In total the 3 aircraft have delivered supplies which include:

•3 forklift trucks and heavy lifting machinery to help cargo move quickly through Kathmandu airport operated by the World Food Programme

•more than 1,900 5-litre water purification jerrycans for use by Oxfam

•more than 2,500 shelter kits to be distributed by the International Organisation for Migration and

•medical supplies including bandages, tourniquets and wheelchairs for use by UK Med and Save the Children.

The RAF C-17 will subsequently airlift a number of British nationals to Delhi.

Justine Greening said:

“These latest aid flights have delivered much-needed shelter and water treatment equipment into Kathmandu. These are vital to stop disease from spreading and to prevent an even bigger health crisis from emerging.

“The arrival of our specialist heavy lifting equipment will allow Kathmandu airport to unload aid cargo much more quickly and speed up the delivery of aid supplies across Nepal.”

In addition, a second Chinook helicopter has left the UK from RAF Brize Norton bound for Nepal.

The UK is playing a leading role in responding to the earthquake and is currently the largest donor to the relief operation, having pledged £17.5 million which includes:

•£3 million released under the Rapid Response Facility (RRF)

•£2 million for the British Red Cross

•£5 million to match public donations to the Disasters Emergency Committee’s appeal which will support NGOs on the ground

•a £5 million package to provide a further team of 30 trauma medics, logistical support and equipment to ease congestion at Kathmandu Airport and humanitarian experts in water, health and sanitation and

•£2.5 million for the UN Humanitarian Air Service to enable organisations already on the ground to immediately get aid supplies to more isolated areas.

We are also providing expert support and assistance on the ground:

•DFID has deployed a team of more than 60 UK International Search and Rescue responders and specialist rescue dogs

•3 RAF Chinook helicopters are being deployed and

•Foreign and Commonwealth Office staff are continuing to work round the clock to identify and assist British nationals in Nepal.
