Sporadic information from Nepal to McConnell Foundation

REDDING, Calif. - The McConnell Foundation has close ties with Nepal because of the many organizations they have in that area.

On Tuesday, a magnitude 7.3 earthquake struck Nepal, coming just over two weeks after a magnitude 7.8 earthquake killed more than 8,000 people on April 25.

"The heart in me just says, wow you know this is going to be difficult and we know from out partners the Nepalese are feeling very supported from around the world," said Shannon Phillips, vice president of operations at the McConnell foundation.

Phillips noted communication with their partners in Nepal has been sporadic at best.

"One email, one tweet, and one Skype comes in every few hours, it just reinforces how our partners and people we know are doing," Phillips explained.

She finally got word from one a partner, telling Phillips fewer people have died, but the damage is significant.

"Just to hear her words in that email made me reduce to tears," Phillips said emotionally.

In that email, the partner explained while they were on their way to a town 50 miles out away from Katmandu the earthquake struck, destroying their vehicle.

"There was landslides, rocks and all kind of debris on their vehicle," Phillips explained.

She said no one was injured, but the partner and people in that car feared for their lives.

Phillips feels helpless about what is going on in Nepal, saying there is nothing she can do from Redding at this time.

"It's a very powerless situation, to sit here in Redding and half way around the world, people that we love, respect, care for are going through this and there is not a lot we can do at this point. Other than send them out support," Phillips added.

About four times a year someone with the McConnell Foundation flies to Nepal. June was the next scheduled trip; however, Phillips said they are waiting to hear from their partners if it will be safe for someone to go.
