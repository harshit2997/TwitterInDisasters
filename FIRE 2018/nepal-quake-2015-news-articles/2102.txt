Four individuals from Chandauli district of Uttar Pradesh, who went on a trip to Nepal, have reportedly gone missing after the earthquake struck Nepal and parts of northern India and their families have requested the Indian Government to find them and bring them back to safety.

The four friends who have been missing are Rakesh Kumar Jaiswal, Ashok Chaurasia, Prashant and Anil Lal.

"My younger brother Rakesh Kumar Jaiswal went to Nepal three days ago. We have not been able to contact him after the earthquake. I request the government to look for him and get him safely back home," said Akhilesh Jaiswal, elder brother of Rakesh.

"My son went to Nepal with three of his friends. I request the government to look for him and get him back home", said Kanhaiya Lal, father of Anil.

Their families spoke to their respective missing family members on Saturday afternoon after the earthquake, but were not able to establish contact with them after that.

"I spoke to my son around 3:00 P.M. yesterday after the earthquake. He told me that all of them were fine and were near the border in Pokhara. I have not been able to talk to him after that," said Prashant's mother.

"I spoke to my husband yesterday around 4:00 P.M. and have not been able to speak to him ever since. We are all very worried here and want him to come back home," Pinky, Ashok's wife.

The death toll from the devastating earthquake, which hit Nepal and northern parts of India on Saturday, climbed over 2,100 today even as the rescue efforts intensified in search of the survivors.

Fresh tremors were felt across Delhi, Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, West Bengal and Assam earlier in the day after an earthquake of 6.7 magnitude hit the east of Kathmandu.

The massive earthquake and the aftershocks left behind a trail of death and destruction in Nepal's capital Kathmandu as well as parts of India.
