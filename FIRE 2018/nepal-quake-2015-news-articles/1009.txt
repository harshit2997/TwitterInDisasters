Nepal Earthquake: Mountaineer Anusha Subramanian narrowly evades the disaster
</headline>

<text>
I consider myself lucky for ticking two peaks off my bucket list â€“ the Everest Base Camp (5,300 mt) and Kalapathar trek (5,545 mt) and returning home safely in the nick of the time. On April 1, I left for Kathmandu. My trek to Everest Base Camp (EBC), which I completed in record time of nine days, started on April 6. I walked solo for one day and then met my team at Kainzuma on April 7.

All along our trek, the weather was sunny and pleasant, but the weather changed on April 11, when we were at Gorakshep and wereclimbing to Kalapathar and EBC. I, along with my guide and one more trekker, had just reached EBC when the weather started getting very windy and seemed as if there could be a snowfall. We immediately turned back to climb down to get back to Gorakshep.

Our plan was to start our trek down to reach Pherche on the same day. It was cloudy and windy and getting extremely cold. As we were coming down, we saw many trekkers going up towards EBC. We even warned some of them to turn around as the weather was turning. At around 3.30 pm when we reached Pheriche, we got the news that the weather on top was bad and it had started snowing.

On April 13, we started walking down in calf-deep snow and slush. There were trekkers, porters and yaks walking down the same slippery path. We reached Namche Bazaar safely with no injuries. Next day, we got clear weather and we walked peacefully to get back to Lukla.

Three of my friends, Kuntal Joisher, Hemant Gupta and Payo Murmur, had already started their climb up to Mt Everest. This afternoon I heard that Hemant and Payo are safe at Camp 1. The location of Kuntal, who is also safe, is however not known to me.
