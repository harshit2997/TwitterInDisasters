(WPRI) — After the deadly widespread 7.8 magnitude earthquake in Nepal this past weekend, the American Red Cross is among those moving into action to get relief, supplies and help to affected residents.

The Red Cross is getting ready to hand out about 19,000 non-food relief kits to people in Nepal, from clothing to kitchen cutlery sets, tarps, mosquito nets and personal hygiene items. A spokesman for the Red Cross, Jeff Hall, said the aid society has stock stored up in the region to cover 50,000 families.

On the Web: Contribute to the American Red Cross Rescue Efforts

Sen. Jack Reed said Monday morning the U.S. government will also be sending aid, from funding to healthcare infrastructure assistance. Right now, it’s at the discussion stage in many parts of Washington, he said, from the CDC to the Department of Defense.

“This is a tremendous human tragedy… The whole world must respond,” Reed said. But, “We can’t do it alone… We have the capability to help organize the relief efforts and provide leadership.”

The response will likely mirror that of the September 2013 earthquake in Pakistan, Reed said. In that incident, 7.7 magnitude, more than eight hundred people died.

The American Red Cross is pledging $300,000 towards the response, recovery and assistance operations, including mapping and information management.

On the Web: International Red Cross: Family Links

The International Committee of the Red Cross has activated a web site designed to link families with their missing loved ones. The program, Family Links, was first used after the typhoon in the Philippines.
