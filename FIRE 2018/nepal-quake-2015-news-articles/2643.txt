DENVER – The last couple of days have been difficult for relatives and friends of possible earthquake victims in Nepal from the U.S. But one Colorado family got some very welcome news late Sunday night, and the survivors say it’s pure luck they weren’t killed.

When they had no information, those loved ones thousands of miles away from Nepal started scouring the Internet. Eventually Denver resident Vance Watt, his brother Jim Watt, and their friend Greg Davenport wound up on a Google document listing the missing in the region of Nepal they were visiting, according to CBS Denver.

Late Sunday night the column for those found and saved went from the word “no” to “yes.”

“It was just this news brief that said ‘big earthquake in Nepal,’ and I said, ‘Holy cow, that’s where he is.’ So I texted him immediately and said, ‘Are you okay?’ And didn’t get a response … and that was Thursday,” said Catrine Watt, Vance Watt’s wife.
