Criticised for conducting search and rescue operations without consent of Nepali authorities, India on Thursday clarified that their teams were working in coordination with the Nepali officials.

India has the largest search and rescue team in the country, followed by China. Media reports have been critical of the ‘Indian style’ of working, alleging that ‘their teams were far more busy airlifting their nationals and ferrying their media crew’. India was also critised for ‘independently’ conducting relief operations.

“The Indian government swiftly swung into action after the devastating earthquake in Nepal by immediately dispatching National Disaster Response Force (NDRF) teams and special aircraft with rescue and relief materials,” said a statement issued here by the Indian Embassy in Kathmandu in its bid to dispel charges against them.

News reports have suggested that China had asked Nepal not to allow the Indian choppers to fly near its border. Instead, China said they would provide helicopters for the purpose. It was not clear whether the Nepal government has accepted the Chinese offer to provide six choppers.

The southern neighbour has so far sent 280 tonnes of relief materials, including drinking water, milk, biscuits, noodles, essential medicines, blankets, tarpaulin and plastic sheets. According to India, its teams are working with Nepali security agencies and have saved 11 lives and retrieved 121 dead bodies from various places in Kathmandu’s World Heritage Sites of Patan, Bhaktapur and Swayambhu and the Dharahara tower.
