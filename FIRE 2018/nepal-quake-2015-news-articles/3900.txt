LONDON, April 28 (Xinhua) -- Britain has been investigating "unconfirmed reports" of a British national's death in quake-hit Nepal, British Foreign Secretary Philip Hammond said Tuesday.

"We are urgently investigating unconfirmed reports of a non-UK resident British National having been killed and our teams on the ground will report back as soon as they have any further information on that," Hammond said in an update on the situation in Nepal.

"I've spoken to the Nepalese prime minister this morning to assure him of our commitment to see what other assistance Nepal urgently needs," he added.

He noted that British staff are continuing to work "round the clock" to identify and assist British nationals in Nepal.

Britain has deployed a British Army Gurkha team to Mount Qomolangma to trek down the mountain and identify and report British nationals on the way as they go, according to the British Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO).

Britain has also sent two aircraft to assist with the relief work in Nepal, including a C-17 aircraft loaded with British Army Gurkha Engineers and equipment as well as a government chartered Boeing 767 loaded with rescue teams and supplies.

"They're both waiting for landing slots when the weather at Kathmandu permits. They will be in and operating as soon as possible," Hammond said.

The foreign secretary added that there were 60 British personnel, search and rescue teams and other experts already on the ground delivering assistance.

"We'll hold a COBR (Cabinet Office Briefing Rooms) meeting tomorrow which I will chair to take stock of where we are and to look at further assistance needs of the Nepalese government," Hammond continued.

The death toll from a powerful earthquake in Nepal has risen to 5,057, and a total of 10,915 others were injured, said the Nepalese Ministry of Home Affairs Tuesday. The 7.9-magnitude hit Nepal at midday on Saturday.
