The Centre has kept National Disaster Response Force (NDRF) and Indian Air Force (IAF)on stand-by in case Nepal calls for help.

Unlike earlier, India is waiting for Nepal to ask for help before sending help to the Himalayan nation in the aftermath of yet another devastating earthquake, reports The Indian Express.

The Centre has kept National Disaster Response Force (NDRF) and Indian Air Force (IAF)on stand-by in case Nepal calls for help, the report adds. A senior official mentioned in the report has said that either the Nepal ambassador to India or the Indian ambassador to Nepal will have to make the call for help, as India does not want to be seen as interfering in their work. Twelve teams of NDRF will fly from Ghaziabad, Pune and Chennai if Nepal asks for help in relief and rescue operations.

The Home Ministry had held three meetings with officials from the PM's Office o te issue. PM Narendra Modi too had taken stock of the situation and asked to be on alert for any rescue and relief operation. Home Minister Rajnath Singh has spoken to Nepal envoy.

The Centre has set up a single helpline number-1078 for all queries related to the disaster.
