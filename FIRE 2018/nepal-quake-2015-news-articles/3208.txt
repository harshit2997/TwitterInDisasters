IPOH: Tan Sri Michelle Yeoh and her fiance Datuk Jean Todt have returned to France safely from Nepal.

The actress’ mother Datin Janet Yeoh said the couple had been in Kathmandu for the Federation Internationale De L'Automobile (FIA) Asia-Pacific Sport Regional Congress at the time of the earthquake on Saturday.

“Michelle called my daughter-in-law following the earthquake to reassure us that she is safe. It was a huge relief as we were unable to reach her when news of the disaster appeared all over the news,” she said when contacted yesterday.

Apparently, Michelle, 52, and Todt, 69, were evacuated from the disaster-hit country with help from the FIA. Todt is president of the world motorsport governing body while Michelle is its road safety ambassador.

Earlier, The Straits Times of Singapore reported that the couple were stranded in Nepal following the earthquake.

The Malaysian Embassy in Nepal has set up a temporary operations centre at the Kathmandu airport.

This is to provide aid to Malaysians affected by the earthquake, said its charge d’ affaires Fadli Adilah.

“If you could not reach your family members who are here, it’s most probably because their phones ran out of battery as there had been no electricity for three days, or the phone line is simply not stable,” he said.

He said that Malaysia Airlines, AirAsia and Malindo Air had resumed operations since yesterday.

Fadli called on those who were still stranded to contact him at +977 980 108 8848.

Bernama reports that the Special Malaysia Disaster Assistance and Rescue Team (SMART) has sent 20 doctors and 30 personnel to help earthquake victims in Nepal.
