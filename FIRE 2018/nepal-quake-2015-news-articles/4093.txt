Smith: A free lunch, a chance to help Nepal
</headline>

<text>
Hearts, minds and wallets open to Nepal following the devastating earthquake the likes of which we can imagine striking here, and that no doubt will.

“We couldn’t only be spectators,” said Adil Gauchan, whose family owns a Nepalese/Indian restaurant on Petaluma’s North McDowell Boulevard.

He invites us to come to Namaste Kitchen between 11 a.m. and 3 p.m. Saturday or Sunday, enjoy a free buffet and make a donation to quake relief efforts of the Red Cross.

As an alternative, it’s easy to contribute $10 to any of several earthquake relief agencies. The charge will go onto your cellphone bill if you text:

· Give Nepal to 80888, Global Giving’s Nepal Earthquake Relief Fund.

· Nepal to 20222, Save the Children.

· Nepal to 864233, UNICEF.

· Reliefnepal to 45678, the UN World Food Program.

TWO NON-GRADUATES of Santa Rosa High have dug deep to assure that several deserving students aren’t excluded from what could be the trip of their young lives.

Tony Shira graduated from Healdsburg High in 1995, Randy Waller from Rincon Valley Christian in 1999. Now they run W Real Estate of Santa Rosa.

They heard that SRHS history teacher and History Club adviser Dave Franzman will take 35 students on a history-rich journey to Washington, D.C., and New York City in June.

Several students, some of whom haven’t been outside of Sonoma County, struggled to come up with their share of the travel costs. Waller and Shira wanted to make sure none is bumped for a lack of money.

“These experiences are priceless,” Waller said.

Wednesday, he and Shira gave $8,000 to Franzman and six students historically pleased to receive it.

Bound for Monticello, the Capitol, the Holocaust Museum, the 9/11 Museum, Ellis Island, the Statue of Liberty and other attractions, they depart June 8.

DONNA PARKER does much for others, I’m told.

Thursday others will do something for Parker, the Santa Rosa nail-studio owner sidelined by her battle with breast cancer.

Friends, fellow downtown business folks and all others who are interested will meet from 6 to 9 Thursday night at La Rosa Tequileria and Grille.

There will be prize raffles, and La Rosa will give Parker 20 percent of all that guests spend on food and beverages.

125 YEARS IS OLD, even for a bank.

Exchange Bank, founded the 1st of May in 1890, has much to celebrate. Certainly the trust that late bank President Frank Doyle and his wife, Polly, created and that’s awarded $80 million in Doyle Scholarships to more than 120,000 students at SRJC.

To mark its big day, Exchange Bank invites its customers to stop by any branch Friday for a slice of cake. Expect no candles.
