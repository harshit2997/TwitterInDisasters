Hundreds volunteer to help Nepal

More than 400 Nepalese-Australians are volunteering to return home to help with rescue efforts after the devastating earthquake that has left thousands dead.

Help Nepal Network President Dr Raju Adhikari says he has been inundated with calls from members of Australia's 30,000 strong Nepalese community searching for news about family members.

"400 people are willing to volunteer. Most of them have their parents (in Nepal) and wanted to go anyway," he said.

He said NGOs on the ground were doing their best, while Australians would play a significant role in rescue efforts.

Foreign Minister Julie Bishop says authorities have taken calls from more than 1250 families and friends of missing Australians in the country and are attempting to get in touch with all of them.

The embassy in Kathmandu is providing consular assistance to several Australians.

Dr Adhikari said while the 7.8-magnitude quake had been expected for some time, Nepal was unprepared for the extent of the damage.

NGOs are trying their best, he said, but are hampered on the ground by the scale of the damage.

"They are doing their best on their own," he said.

"Australians will play a significant role in the rescue."

Earlier Oxfam and ActionAid described harrowing scenes of the rescue efforts, including massive damage, hospitals and morgues being overwhelmed, homelessness and a lack of clean water.

There were concerns about regional areas that had not yet been reached.

Prime Minister Tony Abbott has urged Australians to keep trying to contact relatives travelling in Nepal.
