At least 42 people killed in earthquake northeast of the capital

KATHMANDU, Nepal – Nepal’s Home Ministry has raised the death toll from the latest quake to at least 42, while saying more than another 1,000 people had been injured.

The magnitude-7.3 quake hit hardest in remote mountain districts northeast of the capital of Nepal, terrifying a nation already shell-shocked by a more powerful quake on April 25 that killed more than 8,000 and flattened entire villages.

Information was slow to reach the capital after Tuesday’s quake, but officials and aid workers said they expected the death toll to almost certainly rise.

The Health Ministry said rescuers had managed to pull three people to safety in the capital, while another nine were rescued in the district of Dolkha.

The quake has caused at least one death in neighbouring Tibet.

A landslide triggered by the quake killed one person and injured three, according to China’s state broadcaster China Central Television.

Two houses also collapsed, CCTV said, quoting disaster relief headquarters of the regional Tibetan government.

It was strongly felt in Tibet’s Jilong and Zhangmu regions, and slightly felt in the Tibetan capital Lhasa.

The quake caused strong shaking across northern India.

At least three people were killed when rooftops or walls collapsed on them in Bihar. The state’s disaster management secretary said the deaths occurred in Patna, Vaishali and Darbhanga districts, next to the border with Nepal.

All Canadian Forces members in Nepal are safe after latest quake

All Canadian Armed Forces members who were deployed to Nepal to help its people recover from a devastating earthquake are safe after this latest quake.

A National Defence spokeswoman says no injuries were reported amongst the Canadian personnel in the country.

At the end of last week, the department said there were about 135 Canadian Armed Forces members deployed in Nepal.

They include members of the Disaster Assistance Response Team, which is made up of civilians as well as members of the Forces.
