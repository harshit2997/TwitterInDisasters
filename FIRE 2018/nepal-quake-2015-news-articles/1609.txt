In the wake of the devastation in Nepal, donations are being collected by the Mennonite Central Committee.

Allan Reesor-McDowell with the committee tells 570 News the earthquake has hit areas already suffering with poverty and malnutrition.

“There is already such a significant amount of poverty and a difficult life already. It will require a fair amount of response to make sure these community are not just in a completely disaster situation.”

The Mennonite Central Committee has been providing relief in Nepal for 60 years and will be working with partners in Nepal to access their response in the coming days.
