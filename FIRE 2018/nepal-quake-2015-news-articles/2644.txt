PORTLAND, Ore. -- Mercy Corps hosted a candlelight vigil Monday night, to remember the thousands of people killed in the Nepal earthquake.

Many who attended the vigil said they have relatives in Nepal who have been sleeping in the streets for fear of aftershocks.

"I have my wife and my one-year-old baby, and they are living in an open space under a tent," said Bisswaman Anzdembe. "It was a very narrow escape for them."

The need for relief aid in Nepal is real, but not everyone who asks for it is honest. "Be careful of scammers out there, they take advantage of these situations," said Sophie Dechter with the Better Business Bureau.

Dechter warned people to be especially wary of high-pressure calls from people asking for money. She suggested potential donors get their phone number, research the charity, and then call back if it checks out.

She also warned about social media scams; even those which ask for the smallest donations. "Crowd funding has become so popular," said Dechter. The problem is, there's no way for you to actually tell where that money ends up going."

She added that the BBB has a special website set up to help donors vet legitimate charities from scammers.

As for Mercy Corps, the organization is working to raise money to deliver thousands of supply bags, shelter kits and tarps to Nepal as soon as possible. Donations can be made on the Mercy Corps website.

Portland-based Medical Teams International is also preparing to deploy a relief team to Nepal. You can learn more about that mission, or donate to it, by visiting their website.
