BEIJING, April 27 (Xinhua) -- About 4,000 Chinese tourists remain in quake-hit Nepal as airlines race to evacuate them following Saturday's earthquake, according to the China National Tourism Administration.

As of 4 p.m. on Sunday, Chinese airlines had evacuated more than 1,000 nationals from Nepal, where an 8.1-magnitude earthquake has killed at least 3,218 people, including four Chinese.

Currently, Chinese carriers can bring about 1,200 people home every day.

The Civil Aviation Administration of China asked airlines to prepare more flights to Nepal and prioritize the transport of passengers and humanitarian aid.

The Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs advised people not to visit Nepal in the near future.
