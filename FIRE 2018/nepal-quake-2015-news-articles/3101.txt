Relief items are pouring in from the public to the News 1st, Sirasa Shakthi – Sri Lanka for Nepal Humanitarian programme, as aid to those affected by the earthquake in Nepal which has killed thousands.

An initiative of News1st, Sirasa and Shakthi, the programme is being assisted by the Ministry of Disaster Management, the Disaster Management Center, the security forces and the Police Environment Unit.

The Ministry of Foreign Affairs is assisting in the Coordination of this endeavour.

Relief items are being collected at the Harrisons Building, 330, TB Jaya Mawatha, Colombo 10.

As roads in Nepal have been ruined by the earthquake and as the Katmandu Airport is only open for relief services, we can only accept items on the list of essential items provided by the Nepalese authorities.

Donations that are required are blankets, warm clothing, drinking water, milk powder, canned fish, dry rations, first aid kits, tents, baby products and women’s sanitary items.
