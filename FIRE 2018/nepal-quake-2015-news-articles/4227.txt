Out of the tragedy in Nepal as a horrific earthquake has claimed the lives of thousands of people comes the uplifting news that a 4-month-old baby was found buried alive in the rubble. The rescue came 22 hours after the devastating earthquake shook the Asian nation.

Sonit Awal was pulled to safety Sunday morning by the Nepalese army at 10 a.m. and news of the rescue has gone viral online this week as people around the world who are mourning with the Asian nation look for any glimmer of hope. The infant boy’s father, Shyam Awal, called rescuers after their house collapsed from Saturday’s deadly earthquake.

Soldiers from the Nepalese army searched for the infant until Midnight Saturday night but made no progress and called off the search. The father was losing hope until he heard his baby cry the next day and soldiers returned and found him alive. He was taken to a hospital and was found to not be injured.
