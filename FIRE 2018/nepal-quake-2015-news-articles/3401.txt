Team to travel from North Texas to Nepal to give supplies, medical help to quake survivors

Power lines are down, communication is shoddy and the roads are treacherous. People are living in the open or staying in crowded tents -- that's what the news stories say, at least.A group of Nepalis from North Texas will see the damage and the desperation firsthand when they travel to Nepal this week to provide medical assistance to survivors.The journey to Nepal, however, isn't easy. Relief groups have had limited access to impacted areas because of damaged roads and poor weather conditions.The team of 15 medical professionals -- doctors and nurses -- will leave town Wednesday and take 22 hours of connecting flights to Kathmandu, Nepal's capital.Once there, they will board helicopters provided by the Nepalese Army to get to the Gorkha district, the 7.8-magnitude quake's epicenter.They plan to set up a medical camp where they will also distribute food and clothing, said Bal Joshi, vice president of the Irving-based Nepalese Society of Texas.The volunteers realize their plan won't be easy to execute, but they all speak Nepali, are familiar with the country's geography, and have contacts who can help get supplies from neighboring India if needed, Joshi said.While the team establishes its workflow in Nepal, the Nepalese community here in the Dallas area will continue collecting money and supplies to send to them.The requested items: surgical disposables such as dressing sets and gowns; tourniquets; portable suction units; laryngoscopes; portable stretchers; hand-held pulse oximeters; rechargeable torches and back up systems; portable ultrasound machines and hand sanitizer in bulk.The items can be dropped off at the Nepali Cultural and Spiritual Center in Irving. Monetary donations can be made at the Nepalese Society of Texas' website As of Monday, the Nepalese Society of Texas had collected $32,000, Joshi said. An earthquake relief committee, which has representation from more than a dozen local South Asian organizations, is directly overseeing how the money is spent."We want to make sure every penny goes in the right place," Joshi said.An overwhelming number of people have also asked to join the volunteer team bound for Nepal.But, Joshi said, sending too many people at once could hamper recovery efforts. The relief committee plans to send another group of volunteers next month, when the first team is ready to return to North Texas."We have to make sure they can take care of themselves, and secondly that they can be productive when they get there," Joshi said.
