Jaipur: The Rajasthan government today said 123 people from the state who were stranded in earthquake- ravaged Nepal have been evacuated from there and 120 others would also return soon.

"We have sent our teams headed by two senior officers to coordinate relief works in earthquake-hit Nepal. One team has already reached Kathmandu by road. So far 123 people have come back and 120 will also return soon," Parliamentary Affairs Minister Rajendra Rathore told reporters.

A meeting was chaired here by Chief Minister Vasundhara Raje to discuss earthquake relief works undertaken by her government.

The Minister said the state government has sent 5 buses to bring back people stranded in the Himalayan nation and Raje was reviewing the relief works.
