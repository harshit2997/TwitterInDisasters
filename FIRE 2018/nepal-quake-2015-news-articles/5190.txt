Kathmandu: Two fresh tremors were felt in Nepal on Friday, triggering panic among the people still reeling from the impact of the devastating earthquake that has claimed nearly 8,000 lives. Aftershocks continued to rock Nepal with two more mild tremors being felt in central Nepal on Friday morning. The epicentre of the tremors being Sindhupalchowk and Dolakha districts, east of Kathmandu.

A 4-magnitude tremor was felt at 2.19am this morning with the epicentre at Sindhupalchowk district, according to National Seismological Centre. Another tremor measuring 5 on the Richter scale was felt at 6.17am with the epicentre being at Dolakha. However, no damage was reported from the tremors.

About 150 aftershocks measuring 4 or more on the Richter scale have been reported after the 25 April quake. The death toll due to the earthquake has reached 7,885 so far while the number of injured has shot up to 16,390, officials said. Sindhupalchowk is the worst-hit district with nearly 3,000 people dead while 1,209 have been killed in Kathmandu.

Meanwhile, the Indian Embassy here strongly refuted a media report in a national daily that said all the rescue and relief operations carried out by the Indian Air Force were not done in coordination with Nepal authorities. “The fact of the matter is that the Indian military aircrafts are operating in full coordination and consultation with the Nepalese Army. A liaison officer of the Nepalese Army accompanies each flight,” the Indian Embassy spokesperson said.

“All Indian Air Force flights take place in accordance with the decision of the Nepalese Army. Indian Air Force and Army do not have any direct linkage with chief district officers and district authorities,” the spokesperson added. Indian helicopters carry relief material of various countries including India, handed over by the Nepalese Army, the Embassy stated. “So, the presumption in the news report that the Indian helicopters are carrying relief material without coordinating with the Nepalese authorities is completely baseless,” it said.
