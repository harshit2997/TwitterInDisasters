Medical staff of the Chinese National Earthquake Rescue Team will spend their festival in Nepal on May 12, International Nurses Day. For those working overseas, rather than celebrating they will have a very different experience during this year's festival.

Those in Nepal are too busy to enjoy their May 12, as they are working as hard as they did recently. The medical unit of the rescue team consists of 70 staff from the Chengdu Military General Hospital in southwest China's Sichuan Province. They arrived in the capital, Kathmandu, on the night of April 27 and have since camped in the yard of the Premier House of Nepal.

At least 8,046 persons were confirmed dead in the April 25 devastating quake in Nepal, according to the country's Ministry of Home Affairs on May 11.
