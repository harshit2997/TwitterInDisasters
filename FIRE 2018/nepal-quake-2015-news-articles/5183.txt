Israel, which is currently offering medical aid to quake victims in Nepal through its field hospitals, has acknowledged India’s logistical support to it in carrying out rescue and relief work.

Ambassador of Israel to India Daniel Carmon on Friday said except for landing permission for its aircraft in Kathmandu, Israel sought the help of Indian authorities for arranging its operations to carry out the relief work.

Even as the Indian media faced criticism in Nepal for its reportage from the quake-hit ground, and there were murmurs about Indian authorities being on an overdrive to publicise relief efforts, the Israeli Ambassador said the world admires the swiftness with which India moved in with an impressive force to help the quake-hit country. “All government departments approached by us went out of their way to help us,” Mr. Carmon said.

He was, however, quick to point out that despite the geographic distance, Israel wasted no time in reaching Nepal, offering its expertise in rescue and relief, just as it has done in 2001 when an earthquake ravaged Gujarat. “Within 96 hours [of the quake] our field hospital was running and our search and rescue people were on the ground,” Mr. Carmon said. He added that the Nepalese authorities have asked Israel to continue its medical services for some more time. Israel flew in 11 tonnes of relief material, including medicines, food and water supplies that were all procured from India.

Israel has also announced that it will adopt a village, which will be reconstructed and rehabilitated, just as it had done in Turkey. “Our Foreign Ministry has already declared that we would be adopting a village for reconstruction. We will identify our fellow partners in this reconstruction and rehabilitation work as soon as things begin to settle down,” Mr. Carmon said.

The Israeli Ambassador said it was part of Israel’s policy to offer help wherever needed. “It is a part of our DNA, our Jewish value to help out. There is hardly any place where we have not helped out, whether it is Armenia, Argentina, Mexico or Turkey,” he said.
