The Rotary Club of Murray Bridge has given a helping hand to earthquake victims in Nepal, sending three emergency aid ShelterBoxes to the country.

The Rotary Club of Murray Bridge has given a helping hand to earthquake victims in Nepal, sending three emergency aid ShelterBoxes to the country last week.

Valued at about $1000 each, the boxes assist up to 10 people by providing them with a family tent, blankets, waterproof ground mats, a solar light, mosquito nets, a tool kit, water containers, cooking utensils and items specifically required for the area.

Having the boxes strategically located around the world, the Rotary's three ShelterBoxes arrived in Nepal within 24 hours along with about 500 others funded by clubs world-wide.

Tents inside the boxes have been able to provide privacy to hospital patients after buildings were lost in the disaster and medical staff were left with no option but to treat them outside.

They have also been used for carrying out minor operations, changing dressings and as mobile health clinics.

Rotary Club of Murray Bridge vice-president John Scarvelis said this year alone the club had sent ShelterBoxes to three countries - Vanuatu, Philippines and now Nepal.

He said being able to help those in need during times of disaster and distress was such a rewarding feeling.

"This is one of the reasons Rotarians join Rotary," he said.

"We feel we are doing something good that you can't do in any other way.

"It's great to work together to make a difference locally and also internationally."

Rotary clubs' rapid responses after natural and manmade disasters often see their supplies being the first to aid victim, providing families with emergency shelter and other vital items when they need it most.
