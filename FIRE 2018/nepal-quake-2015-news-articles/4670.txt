A TEAM of volunteers from the Royal Charity Organisation (RCO) has begun relief operations in Nepal in collaboration with the Art of Living Foundation and the International Association for Human Values, two groups which have been working with Nepali authorities to bring aid to survivors of an earthquake.

Shaikh Isa bin Abdulla Al Khalifa, who is leading the Bahrain team and RCO secretary general Dr Mustafa Al Sayed visited the AOL-IAHV camp to start the work on the Bahrain Camp in Kathmandu.

"The morale and the sense of purpose of these two groups are very high and we are impressed with their commitment and focus," said Shaikh Isa. "We are sure that with their help we shall be able to achieve all our first line of goals in relief work."

The Bahrain Camp will be a centre with 200 tents for survivors. Dr Al Sayed said, "We are working closely with these two groups and the Nepali authorities to ensure that our support is properly focused. Right now, the time for search and rescue is past and the focus is on shelter and rehabilitation of survivors.

"The Art of Living Foundation's connections with other aid agencies have been most helpful, especially since the RCO has worked with the Bahrain chapter of AOL before and we trust their ability to achieve results through compassion."
