India is sending disaster-response teams, medical aid and food supplies to Nepal, which was hit by a powerful earthquake Saturday.

India’s foreign secretary, S. Jaishankar, said India would do “everything within its capability to be of help to Nepal in this difficult moment.”

Nearly 900 people have died, according to Nepalese police, who say the toll is likely to rise.

Mr. Jaishankar said Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who has made strengthening India’s relations with its neighbors one of his foreign policy priorities, has given Indian officials a “strong message to step forward.”

“Today’s Earthquake has made us all very sad,” a tweet from Mr. Modi’s official Twitter account said. “Nepal’s pain is our pain,” another tweet said.

Mr. Modi spoke to Nepal’s president, Ram Baran Yadav, and Prime Minister Sushil Koirala, assuring them of “support and assistance during this tough time,” Mr. Modi said in a tweet from his personal Twitter account.

Mr. Modi has made two visits to Nepal in his first year in office, one for talks with the Nepalese government and another for a summit of South Asian countries. The Indian premier is looking to bolster his country’s leadership role at a time when China has made deep in-roads into countries such as Nepal and Sri Lanka.

India’s Foreign Ministry said four air force planes – including a C-130 Super Hercules – were scheduled to touch down in Katmandu by the end of the day Saturday, carrying dozens of disaster-management personnel and a mobile hospital. Helicopters were also being prepared to help with rescue efforts and the distribution of food, the Foreign Ministry said.

Mr. Jaishankar said more aircraft would fly to Nepal in the coming days carrying ready-to-eat meals, specialized engineering teams, tents and blankets. India will also be working to bring Indian nationals home from Nepal, he said.
