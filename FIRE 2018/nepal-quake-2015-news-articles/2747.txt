Canadian hiking couple's family waits for news from Nepal
</headline>

<text>
Several Canadian families with loved ones in earthquake-ravaged Nepal are overwhelmed with worry at the lack of news.

One of those is Vancouver man Adam Smith who is doing everything he can to try and locate his aunt and uncle. His cousins are also overseas trying to organize some kind of rescue effort.

"Really what we're trying to do here is just make sure we coordinate our efforts as best as we can," Smith says.

Bruce MacMillan, 62, and his wife Kathy, 57, had left for a seven-day trek in the mountainous region of Langtang National Park — just three hours north of Kathmandu — on April 20. The pair hasn't been heard from since the earthquake.

"They would be trekking essentially from teahouse to teahouse, so they're not going to be carrying any tents. They're going to have very light camping gear," Smith said.

MacMillan's two sons are also overseas trying to track down information.

"One is located right now in Delhi, India. He's working with the embassies, and I have another cousin who's actually in Kathmandu, so he's been in contact with Canadian officials on the ground there," Smith says.

Smith says the family is frustrated a Canadian rescue mission wasn't launched immediately.

"What we need to see is as many resources as possible to push up north to these kinds of remote regions," Smith said.

"We have reports of a number of Canadians from what we've been able to gather on social media that are potentially stuck in the region with no signs of ability to get out with road erosion."

Canada's Foreign Affairs Department says there are 462 Canadians registered as being in Nepal, but that's only an estimate because registration is voluntary.
