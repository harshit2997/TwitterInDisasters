Medical team treats 1,500 during trip to Nepal

A team of area medical professionals returned Thursday from a week-long medical relief trip to Nepal, just two days after experiencing a 7.3-magnitude earthquake that struck the country — its second major quake in less than a month.

While in Nepal they set up camp about 45 miles northeast of Kathmandu, the Nepalese capital, and traveled to surrounding villages. Mobile teams traveled three to five miles into the mountains to reach even more remote areas. Students from Kathmandu University, including medical and nursing students, accompanied them and translated.

Dr. Kris Brickman, chairman of the emergency medicine department at the University of Toledo Medical Center, estimates the team treated 1,500 patients over six days. They set broken bones, cleaned out wounds, and treated infections while a thick haze of dust hung over the villages, he said.

The team of 16 included professionals from ProMedica and UTMC, the former Medical College of Ohio Hospital, as well as doctors from elsewhere in the Midwest and Northeast.

The trip’s most dramatic moment came Tuesday, its second-to-last day, when the second major quake struck with an epicenter near the villages where the Ohio team had been working, though they were not in the villages at the time. By then they had returned to Kathmandu and were meeting with officials from the local university when everything around them began to shake.

At first, they didn't realize it was an earthquake, Dr. Brickman said.

They’d felt aftershocks regularly during the trip, but soon realized it was the real deal when the Nepalese officials fled the building.

Dr. Brickman described the experience as surreal, knowing they had been near the epicenter 12 hours earlier. He hasn't been able to confirm how much additional damage occurred in the area where they worked.

“It's impossible to run during an earthquake. You don't know where to put your feet,” he said. “It’s something we will never forget the rest of our lives.”

Jet-lagged and a little weary Friday as he recalled the trip, Dr. Brickman praised the warmth and perseverance of the people he met.

“It was an amazing experience, based on the shock and trauma they had been through,” he said. “Most of these families had someone die in the earthquake, or someone injured. They lost their homes or livestock, but they were surviving and they were rebuilding.”
