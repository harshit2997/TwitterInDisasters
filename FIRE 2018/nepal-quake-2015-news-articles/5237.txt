Nepal villages without quake relief, as UN says appeal fund slow
</headline>

Kathmandu - Residents of remote villages in Nepal said on Friday they had still not received any government aid since the earthquake which struck last month, as the UN said the response to its flash funding appeal was slow.

"Even after two weeks, we have not received government assistance," said Rajesh Katuwal, a resident of Sindupalchowk province north of Kathmandu, where 3 000 of the estimated 7 800 deaths nationwide occurred in the quake on April 25.

Many other villages cut off by the 7.8-magnitude earthquake have reported a similar lack of official help, while some others have reportedly received duplicate aid.

The government said it would dispatch five-member teams to 500 affected villages to improve relief allocation.

The UN said that its appeal for flash funding for the Nepal crisis had only received 6% of the requested $423m.

Another $93m had been made available for longer-term funding of development and reconstruction in the country.

Nepalese Prime Minister Sushil Koirala on Friday called for national unity.

â€œThis is the time for all to be enthusiastic and committed and support each other so that we can get through this disaster," Koirala said.

Government estimates say 500 000 homes were destroyed by the quake, which has added to pressure to provide arrangements for shelter.

Foreign aid has been pouring in since the quake, but delivery on the group has appeared low.

On Friday, the British government said it had already provided emergency shelter for 65 000 people and aimed at delivering 20 000 more shelters, enough to house 100 000 people.
