(ANSA) - New Delhi, May 1 - The emergency for Italian citizens in Nepal during the devastating 7.8-magnitude earthquake that hit the capital Kathmandu and its surrounding areas on April 25 is "practically over", Italian diplomatic sources in New Delhi told ANSA on Friday. Two groups of Italian nationals had been having difficulty getting out of the cities of Lukla and Dunchee. "Almost all of them have now arrived or are about to reach Kathmandu," said the source, Another group of Italians who were in Nepal at the time of the quake are expected to land at Pratica di Mare airport near Rome on Friday afternoon on board a military plane, the Italian foreign ministry said. The flight is also carrying some 30 EU citizens under a cooperation deal among crisis units from different countries intervening in Nepal's emergency. Four Italians have been confirmed dead in the earthquake that is feared to have killed as many as 10,000 people, and Italy's foreign ministry has sent civil protection and Red Cross units to help out in the disaster-struck country. Earlier on Friday, four Italians and a Spanish national were evacuated from Kathmandu with a helicopter through Italian ministry personnel on the ground. The bodies of two of the Italians who died in the quake - Oskar Piazza and Gigliola Mancinelli - were also transported to the Nepalese capital by helicopter. Seven other Italians made it to Kathmandu on their own and will be repatriated with crisis unit and embassy assistance.
