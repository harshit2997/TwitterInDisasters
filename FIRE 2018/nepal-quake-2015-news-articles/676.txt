NZ family endures 'frustrating' wait for news of missing loved one in Nepal

A young New Zealand woman is missing in Nepal after the fatal 7.8 magnitude earthquake that rocked the country on Saturday.

Alicia Scroggins is one of 14 New Zealanders the Red Cross lists as unaccounted for in the Himalayan nation.

When the quake struck the 21-year-old and a friend were trekking through the Langtang Valley with a guide.

On April 18 Scroggins posted on her Facebook page "In Nepal enjoying unlimited masala tea with ambie, life is so good".

Ms Scroggins' sister Annie Wood told The Press newspaper it was "frustrating" waiting to hear news of her sister but she said her family was hopeful she was safe.

Ms Scroggins lived in Auckland with her parents before embarking on the seven day trek, but spent her childhood in Canterbury before moving to the United States with her family while at intermediate school, The Press reports.

A New Zealand Red Cross team of three telecommunications specialists will head to Nepal today to help fix broken network infrastructure.

Today Nepal's Home Ministry said the country's death toll had risen to 4,010 people.
