Mumbai, April 25: Bollywood megastar Amitabh Bachchan on Saturday expressed his horror over the massive damage that Nepal suffered in an earthquake measuring 7.9 on the Richter Scale.

Bachchan posted a picture on Twitter showing a temple in Kathmandu badly damaged in the earthquake and said he and actress Zeenat Aman had shot a song sequence of 1983 film Mahaan there. The structure lied in ruins after Saturday's earthquake.

Over 150 people were feared dead in the Himalayan nation as a result of the disaster. A number of traditional sites were also destroyed.

India extended help to Nepal at the time of the crisis. National disaster relief teams and Air Force personnel were dispatched to Nepal to help the government carry out its relief operations.

Bhutan, another Himalayan neighbour of India, was however, not much affected.
