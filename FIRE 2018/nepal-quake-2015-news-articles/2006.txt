Nepal earthquake: '90% of his village was destroyed before his eyes'

Writing from the remote district of Gorkha in Nepal, Matt Darvas is contributing to aid efforts by the Australian non-governmental organisation World Vision after a devastating earthquake on Saturday

Hundreds of villages in the central Nepalese district of Gorkha were among the hardest hit by a 7.8-magnitude earthquake that struck the country on Saturday. The remote and mountainous region, home to an estimated 270,000 people, is struggling to evacuate survivors, with rescue efforts hampered by landslides.

On Monday, I arrived in the district’s main village, also called Gorkha. Under normal circumstances the outlying villages are one or two days’ walk from the government headquarters, but many have been cut off by the quake. Local officials coordinating the relief effort need help, but do not know how or from whom to get it.

The day before, I witnessed the first survivors arriving by helicopter to the Western Regional hospital at Pokhara, nearly 50 miles west of Gorkha.

My wife and I have been living in Pokhara for the past two years, and at 1pm on Saturday, when the earthquake struck, our house started to shake. We picked up our nine-month-old daughter and ran straight out on to the street, much like our neighbours, sitting in the brace position as the shaking continued for two to three minutes. Since then there have been up to 30 aftershocks, including a large one registering 6.4-magnitude almost 24 hours after the initial quake.

At the hospital I met a 75-year-old man with a deep laceration and fracture of his leg. He told me 90% of his village, or about 1,100 households, had been destroyed before his eyes. He was overcome with emotion and struggled to speak. He had been born in that village, Barpak, and had spent his entire life there. When the earthquake struck he said it was like a volcanic explosion, with rocks flying everywhere.

Brought in on the same helicopter, and also from Barpak, was a nine-year-old girl with her mother and younger brother. The girl said her house had fallen on top of her and she had dislocated her hip. Another older brother pulled her to safety.

The villagers remain anxious about the fate of their family, friends and others in the community. The current death toll in Barpak is 11, but many more villagers remain trapped under the rubble and are yet to be accounted for.

This is the story of just one village in the Gorkha region, of a possible 1,000, according to locals, and may be indicative of the scale of the disaster across the area. Many of these villages are likely to be without clean water, adequate food, shelter and basic medical supplies.

It could be days before some of the residents are reached by rescue teams. Many villages are on the steep slopes of precarious mountains and hillsides, where there remains a risk of landslides.

Helicopters have been struggling to conduct surveillance flights around these mountains due to heavy cloud cover, which has made it even more difficult for them to land and deliver any aid.

World Vision aims to assist 100,000 people across Nepal in the initial emergency response. Distributions of tarpaulins and blankets started two days after the earthquake and the most immediate needs are expected to be water, food, household supplies, temporary shelter and protection for children.
