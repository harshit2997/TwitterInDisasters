PETALING JAYA: Malaysians travelling to Nepal have been advised to contact the embassy in Kathmandu for assistance, following the second major earthquake to hit the country on Tuesday.

The Ministry of Foreign Affairs said it was in the midst of identifying whether any Malaysians were involved in the latest quake, which measured 7.3 on the Richter scale.

"The Ministry wishes to reiterate that it is important for all Malaysians who intend to undertake a visit to the country, to contact the Embassy of Malaysia in Kathmandu.

"This will assist the Embassy in providing the required consular assistance to Malaysians abroad," it said in a statement Tuesday evening.

The fresh earthquake in Nepal occurred just two weeks after the previous 7.8 magnitude earthquake that left more than 8,000 people dead.

At least 37 people have been reported killed as Tuesday's quake spread panic around Nepal and unleashed landslides in the Himalayan valleys near Mount Everest.

Most of the reported fatalities were in villages to the east of Kathmandu, only just beginning to pick up the pieces after the Apr 25 disaster.
