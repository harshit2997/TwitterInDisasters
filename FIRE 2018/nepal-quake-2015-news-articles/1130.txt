The students plan to stay for 10 more days to help any way they can.

Back in Omaha, members of the Nebraska Nepalese Society are doing what they can to help from other other side of the world.

"The place we're staying, it's pretty bad," said Brandon Grant, a Nebraska Christian College student who spoke with KETV Newswatch Seven over Facetime. "Everybody had to sleep outside last night because of the aftershocks."

The college students felt the quake from about two hours outside Kathmandu

"For about 30 seconds, it was just I mean, everything was shaking, people were freaking out," Grant said. "We were seeing buildings start to fall and some of it up on top of the mountain just totally destroyed."

All of the students are safe and have made contact with their families since the earthquake happened.

Members of the Nebraska Nepalese Society in Omaha spent the day following social media reports and trying to contact their families.

"Luckily we don't have any casualties that we know of so far," Amrit Kandel said. "But this could really change as we get more updates."

Members of the society watch the devastation on their phones and computers, and relay firsthand accounts from the calls that get through.

"I even talked with one of our other family friends and he said that they have many hospitals there and they are getting over-flooded," Kandel said. "Even the hospitals are damaged. He said he walked by and he saw 16 bodies laying there in a row."

The men banded together Saturday night in Kandel's La Vista living room, trying to cope with the pain and heartbreak that spans across continents.

"The families from there who are living in here -- nobody can sleep in the night," said Deav Kandel, the president of the Nebraska Nepalese Society. "They wake up and then just tears."

The Nebraska Nepalese Society is trying to raise money for victims. They have a GoFundMe page set up http://www.gofundme.com/nepaliearthquake
