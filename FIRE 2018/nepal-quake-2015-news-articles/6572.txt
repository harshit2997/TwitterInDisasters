Nepal's only international airport, the vital entry point for flights bringing in aid, was today briefly shut down after a massive 7.3-magnitude earthquake jolted the country, affecting flight operations.



The Tribhuvan International Airport was closed for flights for about two hours as major tremors rocked Nepal following today's quake that killed over people and brought down many structures.



At least three major jolts measuring between 6.3 and 5.0 on the Richter Scale followed the initial 7.3-magnitude quake.Incoming international flights were diverted and outbound flights were delayed when the quake rocked the country at 12: 50 PM local time, ekantipur reported.The services resumed at 2:50 pm after frequency of jolts subsided.Relief teams from around the world are still in Nepal working to provide water, food and medical aid to victims of the April 25 quake.Nepalese authorities had earlier banned large aircraft from landing after the runway at the five-decade-old-runway was damaged in the quake.More than 8,000 people have died, while over 18,000 people have been injured in the quake on April 25.
