BERLIN, April 27 (Xinhua) -- Germany has provided 2.5 million euros (2.73 million U.S. dollars) for meeting the basic needs of victims of the Nepal earthquake, the German government said in a statement Monday.

Staff members of German Red Cross and German technical relief agency THW are expected to bring relief items to Nepal on Monday, including tents, blankets, hygiene kits and a system for processing potable water.

In addition, a number of aid organizations in Germany have sent medical care personnel and rescue experts to the quake-hit country.

Nepal was devastated by a massive 7.8-magnitude earthquake on Saturday. The death toll from the quake has so far climbed to 3,815, with 7,046 sustaining injuries, according to Nepal's Ministry of Foreign Affairs Monday.
