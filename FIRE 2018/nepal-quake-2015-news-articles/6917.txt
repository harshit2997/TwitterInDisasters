PM congratulates SL tri-services contingent in Nepal

For their laudable efforts in helping quake victims

Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe telephoned Major General Maithri Dias of the Sri Lanka Army to congratulate him and his team for their remarkable work in helping victims of the earthquake in Nepal.

Maj. Gen. Dias is leading the Sri Lankan humanitarian effort in quake-ravaged Nepal, with troops drawn from the Sri Lanka Army, Navy and Air Force.

The premier thanked every member of the Sri Lankan team for their dedicated service to ease human suffering in a friendly country devastated by a natural disaster of an unprecedented scale.

The Nepalese government has also expressed its appreciation and gratitude to the tri-services Sri Lankan contingent for their profound commitment towards helping thousands of victims in the nation's darkest hour.

General Gaurav Shumsher Jung Bahadur Rana, the Army Commander of Nepal, invited Maj. Gen. Dias and Brig. Jagath Gunawardena to the military headquarters to personally convey his deep appreciation of the good work done by the Sri Lankan contingent.

The Sri Lankan team was the only foreign contingent in Nepal to be invited by the army chief to convey his gratitude for the services rendered.

Heavy vehicles and equipment required for clearing the debris and related relief work were hired by the Sri Lanka Army without asking the Nepalese government to bear the costs.

The Sri Lankan team is engaged in clearing operations and relief work in the most remote, difficult and dangerous areas of Nepal hit by the disaster.

The Lankan contingent was also hosted to breakfast at the Panchikal army training camp on May 7 in appreciation of their efforts. The team is expected to return to Sri Lanka aboard a SriLankan Airlines flight on May 11.
