California urban search and rescue team sent to Nepal

• To aid in earthquake response • To help those that are still being impacted by this terrible event

LOS ANGELESApril 26, 2015 9:05pmOne of Californias eight urban search and rescue teams has been dispatched to earthquake-ravaged Nepal to help in the response to the devastating 7.8 magnitude earthquake that struck central Nepal.

Urban Search and Rescue Task Force 2, which consists of 57 personnel, will assist local emergency operations in and around the hardest hit areas of the country conducting search and rescue operations.

"Our thoughts and prayers are with the Nepalese people and we are eager to get our world-class first responders on the ground to help those that are still being impacted by this terrible event," says Office of Emergency Services Director Mark Ghilarducci.

The earthquake struck Nepal at approximately 11:11 p.m. PST on April 24 at a depth of about nine miles. The epicenter is northwest of Kathmandu, the nation's capital. Aftershocks have been significant in number and intensity, continuing to cause further damage.

The California rescuers are expected to arrive on Monday in Kathmandu, Nepal.

CA-TF2, sponsored by the Los Angeles County Fire Department, is one of eight such teams that make up the California Urban Search and Rescue Program. The teams have specialized skills and equipment to assist during major disasters. CA-TF2 alone has six canine search handlers. They also carry survival and rescue kits that contain anything from heavy concrete cutting equipment, chainsaws, search cameras and sonar to locate victims, specialized communications and generators.

California Urban Search and Rescue teams have been deployed for duty during Hurricane Katrina, the 2010 Haiti earthquake, the 2011 Japanese earthquake and tsunami, the 2013 Oklahoma tornadoes, the 2014 Washington State mudslide and many other of the world's major disasters.
