Japan wraps up search and rescue mission in Nepal

Japan’s disaster relief team wrapped up its search for earthquake survivors Thursday in Nepal as Kathmandu shifted priority to supporting the survivors.

“The Nepalese government has expressed appreciation for what could not be measured in figures,” said Foreign Ministry bureaucrat Shigenobu Kobayashi, who led the relief team.

Around 70 members of the Japanese team, drawn from various agencies, are scheduled to leave the South Asian nation on Friday while a separate Japanese medical team remains to help those wounded by last month’s powerful earthquake.

The team did not find any survivors during its 10-day stay.

Kobayashi also said it was difficult to coordinate with other foreign relief teams because Japan’s was delayed partly by congestion at the local airport.
