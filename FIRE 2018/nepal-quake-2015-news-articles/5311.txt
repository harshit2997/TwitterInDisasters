Things have returned to normal for Australian actor Hugh Sheridan after his visit to devastated Nepal to search for his younger brother.

The former Packed to the Rafters star had his reunion with his brother Zachary televised on Channel Seven’s Sunday Night program.

• ‘Wish I was dead’: Nepal survivor



After successfully finding Zachary and spending nearly two weeks in Nepal doing charity work to repair damage from the 7.8-magnitude earthquake, the 29-year-old has gone “back to life as it was”.

Sharing a photo of himself lounging in front of the Eiffel Tower in Paris on Thursday, Sheridan wrote: “Je me sens très chanceux d’avoir une passion qui me mène au bout du monde”.

The phrase roughly translates to, “I feel very lucky/fortunate to have a passion that takes me to the end of the world”.

Sheridan also hashtagged the words “back to life”.

The actor has been the subject of backlash in recent weeks after many criticised him for his decision to broadcast his journey.

When news emerged that Channel Seven was seeking a much-needed helicopter in order to transport Sheridan to his brother, social media commentators slammed the star for being “self-absorbed”.

Sheridan was forced to defend his trip on Instagram, writing: “Just to update everyone, last week Zachy declined help from myself or anyone else saying ‘please do not come for me, I am fine, there is so much pain everywhere else’.

“While waiting on his return, I’ve been working with our brother Tom and locals in Kathmandu clearing wreckage. I feel privileged to be here helping, if it wasn’t for Zach I wouldn’t have booked my ticket (silver lining).

“We’d like to thank 7 for sending a crew out to tag along incase my brother was in danger, THANK YOU GOD we never needed reinforcements, can’t imagine anyone in our position would pass on the opportunity for additional aid to a loved one in a disaster zone.

“Our family hope sharing our story helps others understand what people with missing loved ones are still facing, and the desperate need for aid here, prompting others to donate to this beautiful country.”
