UCF's Pi Delta Psi fraternity has opened its arms in support of those affected by Nepal's recent natural disasters.

Nepal was struck by two high-magnitude earthquakes, one on April 25 and the other on Tuesday, and the fraternity is raising money to help those who have been impacted.

The members of Pi Delta Psi are selling T-shirts and fundraising alongside chapters from the University of Florida and the University of South Florida, as well as local businesses, such as Impress Ink Tees and the TastyChomps food blog, according to a press release.

"The latest earthquake is definitely concerning and shows the urgency of the need for humanitarian aid," said Ricky Ly, a UCF graduate of 2008 and one of the founders of UCF's Pi Delta Psi chapter. "We are making more shirts so that people can buy the day of [distribution] and support the people of Nepal, and the recent victims as well as the past victims."

The fraternity will donate 100 percent of the proceeds to Nepal through Direct Relief, a nonprofit and nonpartisan organization that provides medical assistance to areas worldwide that are experiencing natural disasters, poverty or civil unrest, according to its website.

The gray T-shirts that feature an illustrated picture of Mount Everest with the phrase "Pray for Nepal" are being sold for $12.

Donations are accepted on the Direct Relief website, said Jon Chee and Sabik Mahmud, the Pi Delta Psi philanthropy co-chairs.

"The end date [for fundraising] will probably most likely be once we disperse all the shirts because, while we're dispersing shirts, we'll also have donation boxes set up," said Mahmud, a senior electrical engineering major.

The date and location of the distribution have yet to be decided, but will be updated on the Facebook event page.

A shipping fee of $6 allows students the option to have their T-shirts shipped to places outside of the UCF, UF and USF campuses.

The fraternity has the fundraising tactics under its belt as it is no stranger to selling T-shirts for natural disasters.

In 2008, the fraternity raised more than $2,000 for the victims of the Sichuan earthquake in China for the American Red Cross, the release states.

"This is the third time we've done a similar setup. Previously we did 'Hope for the Philippines' about a year ago. That went to relief for the typhoon that happened," said Chee, a junior aerospace engineering major.
