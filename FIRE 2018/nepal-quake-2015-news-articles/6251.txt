U.S. military officials have announced that for the second day, there has been no successful discovery of the U.S. military helicopter that went missing while delivering aid in Nepal on Tueday.

A spokesman for the U.S. Marines confirmed Wednesday that search efforts carried out by the U.S. military and the Nepalese Army have yielded no signs of the Marine Corps UH-1Y Huey helicopter, which lost contact with ground control shortly after its pilot complained of a fuel issue.

The helicopter had been carrying six U.S. marines and two members of the Nepalese Army to deliver aid to the town of Dolakha, while also transporting injured residents out of the town to the capital of Kathmandu.

"There is no positive confirmation of any sighting of the aircraft, and we have no communication with them at this moment," Marines spokeswoman Captain Cassandra Gesecki told Reuters in a statement, adding that search teams have found no evidence that would suggest a crash.

Aid teams were delivering materials, such as rice and tarps, to areas most affected by this week's 7.3 earthquake in Nepal. This week's earthquake is the second in less than a month to ravage the Asian country.

The first earthquake on April 25 had a magnitude of 7.8 and killed over 8,000 people, while injuring over 18,000.

The U.S. Pacific Command has shot down reports from some foreign news agencies that suggested the location of the helicopter had been found.

"There are a lot of reports floating around, none are attributed to anyone and most have been investigated by DoD and determined to be fake," Army Maj. David Eastburn, a spokesman for U.S. Pacific Command, told the Military Times on Wednesday.
