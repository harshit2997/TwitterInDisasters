Here in Alabama, one family has a special connection to the disaster in Nepal. A Montgomery woman says her family was in the earthquake and is now living in the devastation.

"Nepal is a beautiful country," says Sara Khanal.

Khanal was born and raised in Nepal and now lives in Montgomery.

"This is home to me but my heart is back in Nepal," says Khanal.

Her family is also back in Nepal, including her mother, father and older sister.

"When this incident happened, I received a text from my sister, 'we're alive but we don't know'," remembers Khanal. "It was scary. I didn't know how to react. It took me two days to get in touch with my mom and dad and it was very scary."

For five days her parents lived in a tent, riding through the monsoon downpours. Now they are at home with a roof over their head, but they still are without electricity, water, and have very little food only rice and lentils.

Her father just recently had heart surgery and her mom is a diabetic.

When talking about the devastation, she said," my dad took a walk, just a 20 minute walk and he was petrified. He saw dead bodies every where and just laying there and people are not knowing what to do."

She's concerned the death toll will only continue to rise.

"It's not just one or two people, it's thousands of people and there's no bathroom, no sanitary, so that could be a big problem because of diarrhea and cholera spreading."

Known for it's beautiful mountains and historical landmarks and temples, she says half of the country's revenue is derived from tourism. Many of those tourists sites are now in ruins.

Khanal says the people and country are resilient and will bounce back, but says it's going to take years for the country to get back to what it once was before the quake. She believes the only way it's possible is for others to lend a helping hand.

"Every penny counts, $1, $2, it doesn't matter. Just donation, donation, donation, "claimed Khanal.

You can help. The Troy University Nepalese Student Association has started a go fund me account. According to the association, "Nepal, being a developing country with the second lowest per- capita spending power in Asia, does not have enough resources to fight back this sudden emergency. Hence, we are starting this campaign."

Currently more than $1,900 has been raised, but they say every bit helps. The association says $1 USD is equal to roughly 100 Nepalese Rupees, so even a $1 can make a big difference.

We're told the money is monitored by Troy University, and the collected amount will be donated to Red Cross Society in Nepal.
