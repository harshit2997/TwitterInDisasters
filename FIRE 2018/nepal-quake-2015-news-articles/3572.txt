Bendigo Nepalese to hold vigil for countrymen
</headline>

<text>
THEY might be more than 8000 kilometres away, but the connection to home has never been stronger for Bendigo's Nepalese community.

The community of 16 families have watched on in disbelief at the destruction from this week's earthquake, fearing for the lives of friends and family.

Fortunately, none have reported the loss of life of relatives.

Despite being far from home, the community wants to do all it can to help rebuild after countless schools, hospitals and homes were destroyed in the earthquake.

Bendigo's Nepalese community will hold a candlelight vigil on Thursday night to pray for the victims, and to raise funds to rebuild at least one school.

Community member Umesh Shrestha said they wanted to donate $20,000 to the cause.

"We invite all people from Bendigo to come and participate, and to bring a candle to pray with us for the victims," he said.

"A lot of money and goods are flowing in from all over the world, but when the emergency rush stops and there's a gap, that's when victims suffer the most.

"We want to help them rebuild. It won't be an easy task - they need us to help."

Mr Shrestha was among the first Nepalese people to move to Bendigo, when he came to the city nine years ago.

Since then, the community has grown steadily to between 30 and 40 people.

He said the earthquake had been a shock to all.

"We always grew up with temples in the area - very old buildings that we're looked after as well as they could be," Mr Shrestha said.

"We won't be able to see these temples when we go back, it's quite shocking to think about."

The vigil will start at 6.30pm at the war memorial Pall Mall.
