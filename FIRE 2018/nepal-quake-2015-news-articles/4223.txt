It was a harrowing 48-hour wait for Gopal and his brother, Lal Singh, in Mysuru about the fate of their immediate family members and relatives in the quake-affected region of Nepal.

With the communication links completely disrupted and connectivity to rural areas yet to be restored, it was only on Monday evening that Gopal and Lal Singh learnt that their families were safe. Coming from a village in Baitadi district, the wait was unnerving for the brothers, who work with the People for Animals and Reaching Out To Animals in the city.

Lal Singh had returned from Nepal on April 21 after a short stay. During the last two days they have been in constant touch with their family members, but as the lines are busy it is indeed a herculean task to get the connection.

Though the community members are relieved that their relatives and friends are safe, the tragedy that has struck their motherland has affected them. “It is our Janmabhoomi. The relief that our relatives are safe has slowly given way to sorrow over the trail of destruction that the killer quake has left behind”, said Gopal.
