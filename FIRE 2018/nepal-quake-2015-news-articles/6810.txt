Marine from Altamonte Springs among those missing in Nepal chopper

Army helicopters have joined the search for the missing U.S. Marine Corps helicopter that vanished Tuesday in Nepal.

The chopper was delivering disaster aid following the earthquake that killed more than 8,000 people in the country.

U.S. Marine Sgt. Mark Johnson IV, an Altamonte Springs native and father of two, is believed to have been on board that helicopter.

"We said, ‘Love you, be safe,’ and (those) were the last words we said to him,” said Shirley Johnson, Mark Johnson’s mother. "We hoped he would be home by Mother's Day to be with his wife and children. Instead, he took the assignment in Nepal for the relief mission."

Shirley Johnson and her husband, Ward Johnson III, said they wait by their phones and the door for any indication that their son is OK.

"We were terrified the entire eight months he was in Afghanistan, but when he said he had to go to Nepal to deliver food, we were just proud of him,” Ward Johnson said.

Mark Johnson was due home last week, but at the last minute, his unit was sent to Nepal to help the people devastated by the earthquakes.

"We delivered over 68,000 pounds of supplies to the outer villages," he said in a video recorded by the Marine Corps. That was the last time anyone outside of his unit saw or heard from him.

Moments before losing contact with the chopper, radio transmissions indicated a fuel problem.

By Tuesday evening, U.S. officials lost contact with the crew of six Marines.

“(I’m) worried sick, literally,” Ward Johnson said. "If they went down hard and they're alive, they'll survive because they're Marines."

At least four aircraft have been looking for the helicopter, according to officials.

“We want him home,” Shirley Johnson said.

The biggest hope the Johnson family is holding onto is that there is still a search and rescue mission and not a recovery mission.

“It's one of the things that gets us through,” Shirley Johnson said.
