No deaths in Nepal villages looked after by Geraldine trust

A local trust understands there have been no deaths at Nepalese villages where it funds a health service.

Geraldine's Forgotten Sherpas of Nepal Trust funds the Dali Sherpa Memorial Health Service which assists about 2500 people from 25 villages in Nepal's Okhaldunga district.

Trustee Marg Stocker said hearing there had been another 7.3 magnitude earthquake in Nepal was "absolutely ghastly".

Stocker said the trust had been in contact with the daughter of Ngima Sherpa, the trust's guide in Nepal.

"I've tried to get some communication with his daughter and she said that they haven't heard of any deaths. I don't know if there's been any more damage done," Stocker said.

Ten villagers from a village which was assisted by the service, Dorkharka, had died in the last earthquake.

Ngima would be "flat out trying to sort things", Stocker said.

"It's just unbelievable to have another magnitude 7,3. Everything was so unstable and the further worry is the monsoon season," she said.

The trust's New Zealand leader, George Hunter said, like the first earthquake, the second had not struck close to villages in the district where the health service was based.

"It's a serious quake of course, there seems to be some damage," Hunter said.

Hunter had been monitoring the earthquake site Iris for any updates.

"If it's near Namche Bazaar that would be a disaster," he said.

The region was "a favourite trekking area".

The trust had also sent pictures of damaged buildings in the area where its health service operated, to former mountaineer and engineer Norman Hardie, Hunter said.

Hardie had been able to produce engineering reports on the damaged buildings.
