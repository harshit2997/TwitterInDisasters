HYDERABAD: About 28 pilgrims and 15 film crew from Hyderabad were stranded in Nepal following the giant earthquake that shook the Himalayan nation and parts of India on Saturday. Fortunately, all of them are safe.

The pilgrims were on a pilgrimage to the Muktinath shrine in the valley of Thorong La mountain pass while the film crew were at Pokhra, the epicentre of earthquake, shooting for a film titled Yatakaram.

Some of the pilgrims rang up their families back home immediately after the quake. Among them were 15 women and eight men. They went on the pilgrimage on April 17. The trip organiser, Sai Baba Travels, in Malkajgiri also sent five of its employees to escort them.

At the time of the earthquake, the group were at a hotel near the Pasupathinath temple. “The conversation was not at all clear. We are happy that they are safe,” relative of one of the pilgrims said. According to him, the pilgrims, all from Vinayak Nagar in Neredmet and New Vasavi Nagar in Malkajgiri, are concerned about their return to Hyderabad. “The only cause of concern is their return. The roads are damaged and we do not know if they have enough food supplies and water. The government should do something to bring them back safe,” he said. Producer and director Veerendra Reddy and his wife Vanaja had gone to Nepal about 10 days back along with 13 crew members to shoot some scenes. Reddy rang up his father Satyanarayana Reddy, friend of director SV Krishna Reddy, in the evening and told him not to worry.

“He said everyone was safe. Since telephone network is destroyed, it has become very difficult for them to contact us,” Satyanarayana Reddy said.
