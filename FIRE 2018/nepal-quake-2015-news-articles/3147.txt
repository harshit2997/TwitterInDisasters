Four members of the police’s search and rescue unit will be flying to Nepal to help in the disaster relief operations being carried out in that country following a massive earthquake on Saturday

Police spokesperson Major Thulani Zwane said in a statement on Tuesday that Pietermaritzburg-based Lieutenant Jack Haskins and his dog Bear had been selected to join relief efforts.

Haskins told News24 from OR Tambo International Airport that four search and rescue specialists from the police would be flying out with the disaster response organisation Gift of the Givers on Tuesday.

He said the other three police officers – from the Free State, the Eastern Cape and Limpopo respectively – would be joining him on the trip to Nepal.

KwaZulu-Natal Provincial Police Commissioner Lieutenant-General Mmamonnye Ngobeni said: “We wish him good luck and we hope he returns home safely after the duration of the rescue operation.”

At least 10 South Africans are currently trapped on Mount Everest following the 7.8 magnitude earthquake that struck near Kathmandu, causing avalanches on the mountain, Netwerk24 reported on Monday.

The earthquake has so far claimed the lives of over 3 200 people, according to AFP, as well as many in India and Tibet. Thousands were injured and many are trapped under rubble.

At least 17 climbers have been confirmed dead following avalanches on the surrounding mountain ranges.

The group Ubuntu Everest has said that 10 climbers from South Africa were scattered between the base camp at Everest, and camps one and two further up, Netwerk24 reported.

A spokesperson for Ubuntu Everest, Schultz Sarieta, said it was possible that there were more South Africans trapped on the mountain that the group did not know about.

Some of the climbers who were trapped at camp one have already been rescued by helicopter, Schultz added.

Comment could not immediately be obtained from Gift of the Givers.
