WELLINGTON, May 11 (Xinhua) -- A New Zealand engineering team is traveling to Nepal to assess damage caused by the April 25 earthquake, Foreign Minister Murray McCully said Monday.

"The Nepalese government has requested assistance from New Zealand experts with damage assessments of critical public infrastructure, including government buildings and hospitals," McCully said in a statement.

"Four New Zealand engineers, with considerable experience in earthquake strengthening, have volunteered their time and they are en route to Nepal," he said.

"This group of engineers will be in Kathmandu for a week, and, in addition to undertaking damage assessments, they will also help determine whether a larger contingent of 10 to 12 engineers is required," he said.

"This later deployment would be for three months and would focus on assisting with stabilization and retrofitting of damaged buildings."

The New Zealand government had already given 2 million NZ dollars (1.48 million U.S. dollars) in financial assistance to Nepal following the earthquake.
