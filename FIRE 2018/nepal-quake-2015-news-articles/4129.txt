Longtime Chilmark summer resident and Pulitzer Prize-winning photographer Edward Keating made an offer on his Facebook page on Sunday, April 26 that is available to Islanders, in order to generate aid to Nepal earthquake relief efforts.

“Nepal is a very poor but beautiful country, where life is difficult,” he said in his Facebook post. “Three-quarters of its roads are not paved. More than half the country does not have running water. Anyone who promises to send $100 to a relief fund, I will send them an 11×17 inkjet print of any of these photographs.”

Some readers may have met him last summer with his wife, photo editor and photographer Carrie Boretz, at their Chilmark Flea Market booth. Those who have not already made a donation to help Nepal’s relief efforts after a 7.8 earthquake struck the country on Saturday, or who want to do more might want to consider Mr. Keating’s offer. You can see all the photographs at his Facebook page, or at on.fb.me/1OxcICa.

The devastating earthquake was Nepal’s worst natural disaster in more than 80 years. As of Tuesday, the death toll had reached 3,200 and close to 7,000 people have been injured.

Ed Keating has lived and worked as a photographer in New York City since 1981, first chronicling street life, then joining the New York Times as a staff photographer and covering national and international news, contributing regularly to the Sunday Times Magazine. He traveled to Nepal on assignment for the Times in 2007, and created the images he’s offering.

In addition to being one of the co-founders of the New York Times wedding column, Mr. Keating won a Pulitzer Press for his coverage of 9/11, and he is a regular contributor to Time, Rolling Stone, W, and New York Magazine, and photographs weddings on Martha’s Vineyard.
