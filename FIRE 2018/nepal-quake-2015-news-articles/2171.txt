Hundreds of Israeli troops and officers on a rescue mission to quake-stricken Nepal, flocked to Israel’s main Ben Gurion airport on Sunday but an Israeli commander said the mission was delayed by 12 hours in light of problems with Kathmandu’s airport tarmac.

Tens of thousands of people slept in the open air in case of aftershocks in Nepal’s capital city of Kathmandu on Sunday.

Local people were too scared to stay at home after an 8.1 magnitude earthquake rocked Nepal with devastating force on Saturday, killing more than 2,500 people and destroying thousands of homes and historic sites.

Kathmandu’s Tribhuvan International Airport reopened after being closed for about an hour on Sunday afternoon due to a powerful aftershock. Both military and commercial airplanes from other countries are waiting to evacuate their nationals.

International rescue teams have been deployed to help local authorities to search for missing people and save lives.

The 260-strong team, which includes 40 doctors, nurses and medical assistants as well as a group of 64 search and rescue experts, was initially set to leave Israel at 2230 in two commercial Boeing 747 rented by the army. The mission was expected to deliver almost 100 tonnes of supplies, set up a field hospital in Kathmandu and evacuate stranded Israelis.

Meanwhile the bodies of 17 climbers were recovered from the Himalayas, where a major aftershock sent boulders and ice crashing around camps in the high mountains.

There were nearly 1,000 climbers and sherpas on Everest when the first avalanche struck and claimed the highest toll of any disaster on the world’s highest mountain.
