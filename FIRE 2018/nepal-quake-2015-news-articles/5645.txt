Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has thanked his Indian counterpart Narendra Modi for helping Israel in its rescue work in quake-hit Nepal.

Netanyahu in a telephonic conversation on Friday thanked the Indian PM for providing helicopters to assist with the rescue of Israelis (from Nepal) and permitting Israeli relief planes to land in India, an official statement said.

Netanyahu also conveyed his condolences to the families of the Indian victims who lost their lives and were injured in the earthquake, it said.

Earlier, Netanyahu extended Modi an invitation to visit Israel through Maharashtra Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis, who called upon the Israeli leader on Wednesday during his four-day visit to the Jewish state to seek technological cooperation and investments.

Israel has been helping Nepal with relief and rescue operations by setting up a military field hospital to treat victims of the earthquake consisting of trained rescue officials from the Israeli army.

Israeli army sources here said that their rescue team will continue helping the locals for at least another two weeks till the situation comes under control.

Meanwhile, more than 200 Israelis travelling in Nepal have returned to their country since the earthquake, but some still remain missing.
