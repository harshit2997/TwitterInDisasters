A Summit High School graduate trekking in Nepal was reported safe Monday and is helping with the relief effort in the wake of a 7.9-magnitude earthquake there, according to his father.

Joshua Edwards, 19, posted on Facebook early Monday morning alerting his friends to his safety, said his father, John Edwards, on Monday. As of 6 a.m. PST, Joshua Edwards was in Tatopani, Nepal, northeast of the capital, Kathmandu.

“We’re very relieved, very relieved,” said John Edwards.

Joshua Edwards was trekking alone when the earthquake struck Saturday near Kathmandu. The death toll has steadily risen; thousands are believed dead.

John Edwards added the Facebook post was the first time after the quake that his son was able to access Wi-Fi.

The 19-year-old graduated early from Summit High School in January 2014 and arrived in Nepal about a month ago after visits to Laos, Thailand and Mexico. He hiked the Pacific Crest Trail last year.

“He’s on his own. He prefers to travel solo,” John Edwards said. “He doesn’t have to worry that way about leaving anybody behind.”

The last time Joshua Edwards’ family heard from him before the post was April 20, when he was trekking near the village of Muktinath in the Annapurna Conservation Area.
