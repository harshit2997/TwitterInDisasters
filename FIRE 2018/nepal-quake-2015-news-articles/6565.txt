NEW DELHI: The Delhi Police on Monday arrested a 50-year-old alleged Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT) operative, who was on the run for 15 years, from Bahraich in Uttar Pradesh, on Monday. According to the police Irfan Ahmad was involved in recruiting youths for Indian Mujahideen (IM) in India and Nepal.

Interestingly, Irfan was imprisoned in Nepal’s Sindhupal Chowk Jail for attempting to obtain Nepalese citizenship on forged documents. He had managed to escape after jail walls collapsed in the recent earth quake in Nepal.

“Irfan was directly involved in a series of bomb blast that took place in the country after the demolition of Babri Masjid and was arrested from Bahraich near Nepal border” Special Cell Delhi police Commissioner S.N Srivastava said.

Irfan had planted bombs in two Rajdhani trains, Delhi - Howrah and Howrah - Delhi, passing through Kanpur Railway Station, in December 1993 a year after the Babri mosque demolition.

Initially the Special Cell arrested Irfan in 1994 under TADA act and later handed over to the CBI, which was investigating the train serial bombings. Irfan was convicted in 1999 and shifted to jail in Ajmer.

In 2001 Irfan was given four-day parole to attend his brother’s marriage but did not come back after the term expired and went straight to Kolkata to meet Asif Raza Khan, one of the founding members of Indian Mujahedeen, whom he had befriended while in Tihar in 1996-1999.

He was given the task of looking after the IM in Nepal.

Recently Special cell got information of him hiding in Nepal, where he used to work as a jacket manufacturing and also owned a cyber café the police informed.

“He used to indoctrinate Indian youth and send them to Pakistan for receiving training in the handling of arms and ammunition and fabrication of IEDs. After completing the training, they were sent back to him in Kathmandu for further deployment in India. The transit point was Kathmandu” said Srivastava.
