An Auckland man died from a heart attack the night after the earthquake that has devastated Nepal.

Greg Kay, 61, was on a King's College reunion trip to Mount Everest's Base Camp with Peter Hillary, son of Sir Edmund Hillary.

Mr Kay was well known in the business community, having worked as a chief executive at Wrightson Limited and Coal Corporation of New Zealand, as well as a director at Telecom and Pacific Road Corporate Finance.

He is the son of the former Mayor of Auckland, the late Colin Kay.

Mr Kay's family is "shell shocked" to lose "such a special, special man".

He died in his sleep at a hotel in the village of Tengboche, where the group was staying the night.

He is survived by his wife Sudy, two adult sons and a granddaughter
