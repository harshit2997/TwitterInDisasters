Oakville resident sees Nepal devastation firsthand

Messenger recalled talking to one young man who said he liked school but didn’t want to go back because he was afraid that some of his friends might not be there, killed by the earthquake.

“That is a lot for a 13-year-old boy to handle and we’re coming across stories like this all the time. There are children who have just barely survived, others who have lost loved ones and friends and, of course, living with the panic that the disaster might happen again.”

Messenger said he visited a neighbourhood where he could see funeral pyres burning. He was told in that one area, 300 bodies, many of them under age 10, had been burned in the first three days of the recovery effort.

He said the fear of significant aftershocks or another earthquake is ever-present among the population.

“Families are afraid to go into their homes. Most people are continuing to live outside of their homes, even homes that haven’t been destroyed,” he said. “But the Nepalese people are very tight-knit and family-focused and we have families working together and staying together and supporting each other.”

Messenger said the best way for Oakville residents to help the people of Nepal is to make a donation.

“Oakville residents again and again have shown their generosity to people around the world,” he said. “There are children and families in need right now. Organizations like World Vision are ready to help.”

The Canadian government has pledged to match dollar for dollar donations dedicated to Nepal until May 25.
