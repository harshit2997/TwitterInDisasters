Six Welsh firefighters are battling to secure the roof of a hospital in the wake of the Nepal earthquake.

The officers from South Wales Fire and Rescue Service are part of a 67-strong team from UK International Search and Rescue (UKISAR).

Station manager Shaun Moody said the team is working with colleagues from Leicestershire and Essex in Kathmandu.

A collapsed water tower has damaged the hospital roof and is threatening three operating theatres.

The other five team members, Raza Prince, Chris Jones, Simon Comley, Trystan Bowen and Bill Leahy, are all specialists in urban search and rescue.

"If we can re-secure the roof over the next 24 hours, up to 200 operations a day could be carried out in the surgical theatres," said Mr Moody, who is normally based in Kenfig Hill, Bridgend.

"We've brought 12-and-a-half tonnes of rescue equipment with us and we have everything we need. The damage is catastrophic."
