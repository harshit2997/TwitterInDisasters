WLFD president returns to Taiwan from Nepal
</headline>

<text>
Taipei, April 27 (CNA) World League for Freedom and Democracy (WLFD) President Yao Eng-chi returned to Taiwan from earthquake-ravaged Nepal Monday, saying "it's good to be home."



Yao was in the Nepalese capital of Kathmandu for the launch of school buildings built with funds the WLFD raised from Taiwanese businesspeople around the world.



Yao said the 7.8 magnitude earthquake that struck 77 kilometers northwest of Kathmandu -- the strongest to hit Nepal since 1934 -- filled him with fear.



He described chaos at the hotel where he was staying and at the Tribhuvan International Airport.



Set to leave for Taiwan at 11:55 p.m. Saturday, Yao said he waited for 8-9 hours on Sunday before he was able to board a flight for Taiwan.



Yao said members of his delegation joked that they would think twice before traveling with him again, given this and a previous experience when he was in New York on Sept. 11, 2001 when the world trade center was attacked by terrorists.
