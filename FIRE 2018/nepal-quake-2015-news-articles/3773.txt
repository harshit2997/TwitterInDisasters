Foreign tourists trapped in a remote Himalayan valley fought with local people for places on evacuation helicopters as falling rocks and avalanches continued to threaten lives days after the earthquake in Nepal.

A Nepalese man was killed by the ­rotors of a helicopter sent to rescue Israeli trekkers from Langtang Valley. “The villagers demanded that they should be evacuated first, threatened the Israelis and rushed the helicopter,” reported Yedioth Ahronoth, an Israeli newspaper.

“One of the Nepalese was killed when his head was hit by the rotor and in another case several villagers grabbed the helicopter co-pilot and took him hostage to ensure they would be evacuated.”

Rescuers sent by Israeli insurance companies moved about 150 tourists on foot to an alternative landing spot.
