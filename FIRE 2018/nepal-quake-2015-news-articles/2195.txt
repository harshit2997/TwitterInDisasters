Nepal earthquake: Nepalese students in Tasmania without temple for prayer vigil

Posted

Nepalese students in Tasmania are planning to hold a prayer vigil on Friday, 1 May in the wake of the Nepal earthquake, however there is currently no temple to support the service.

Aarati Khanal is studying a PhD in Pharmacy at the University of Tasmania and spoke to Ryk Goddard on 936 ABC Hobart about what the vigil would mean to the students.

"We are calling out on all the Nepalese students studying at the University of Tasmania [UTAS] to come and join us because it's our cultural thing for Nepalese students to pray and we have come to realise that we don't have any temple or anywhere else to go," Ms Khanal said.

We'd like to see our families since we are really, really, really heartbroken. Student, Prava Khada

"We thought this is our best idea to vent out all our emotions because many students would like to go home but it's not quite possible.

"For students if there are any following Hindus there is nowhere for us to go; it's a really sad thing that we don't have a single temple or anything in Hobart at the moment.

"That was a concern that was raised by the students yesterday, that it's the way we heal ourselves, and it's not there," she said.

Ms Khanal is hoping UTAS can find a space to be used for the vigil.

While students are trying to remain positive, there is difficulty contacting their families in Nepal, and when they did get in contact there was not much they could do due to the distance between Tasmania and Nepal.

"My family are OK, but it's very hard for us to get connected. It's a really hard thing to realise that they're outside in the rain and we are warm and comfortable here," Ms Khanal said.

"So it's more like the same stuff – feeling helpless and not being able to help – that's what's bothering us," she said.

Ms Khanal said she was planning to organise a charity event within the university to raise funds to send to Nepal.

"One of the other students lost his family so it was very hard and the university tried to get in touch with the students and have a chat with the student and any financial help we could get for the student," she said.

"We are very happy with all of the support we are getting right now from the university."

Another student, Prava Khada is studying medicine in Launceston and has spoken to her husband and relatives in Nepal about how they are dealing with the disaster.

"In my city [Kathmandu] most of the houses are broken," Ms Khada said.

"At the moment I would like to go back to Nepal, back to my country. More than 60 students are nurses, they all are registered nurses and [it would be good to] go back to Nepal and give our service to Nepalese people.

"We'd like to see our families since we are really, really, really heartbroken. We really want to go back to our country at the moment."

The Nepali Society of Tasmania (NEST) is looking to find alternative ways to raise money to send to Nepal.

Pradip Dhungana has been working with NEST and is from Kathmandu, but has been living in Hobart for six years.

"We have around 200–250 [Nepalese] people in Tasmania right now. We are supporting the communities here in different ways," Mr Dhungana said.

"...A lot of the Nepalese community and students are trying to raise the funds in UTAS. We are just trying to get people to donate the salary of one day salary sacrifice.

"It is a very big earthquake after 18 years in our country so we don't have anything right now, everything is destroyed, and many people are homeless right now."

Mr Dhungana said there will also be a candlelit ceremony at Benjafield Park in Moonah at 6:00pm Friday, 1 May for those who lost their lives in the earthquake.
