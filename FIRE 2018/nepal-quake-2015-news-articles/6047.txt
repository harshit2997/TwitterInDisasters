'It was the end of the world' grief in Nepal - but Wellington helps

Dr John Bosanquet with Dr Bijay Pandey

Two local doctors have begun a campaign to raise funds for the heartbreak in Nepal.

More than 5200 people have been killed, thousands more have been injured, many more displaced as the crisis worsens in the earthquake ravaged Asian country.

Dr John Bosanquet and Dr Bijay Pandey, who is from Nepal and works at the Wellington Aboriginal Corporation Health Service, have banded together to start the appeal.

"Rotary locally is getting behind this appeal. We will send it to the places where it is most needed," Dr Bosanquet said.

"I volunteered for a year there in 2000 at the hospital and every year I go back there and help. While the quake hasn't directly affected the hospital, thousands of people need our help.

"We have set up points at Gersbach's Garage and Plasto Raine and Horne to help and we will give the money directly to the places where it is needed most."

Dr Pandey said his parents live near Kathmandu and they were fortunate to have missed the major tremor.

"They are fine, very lucky. We are so fortunate, we can't complain," he said.

"I was talking to my sister and she said there was a huge shake. Buildings were swaying to one side. She and many others thought it was the end of the world."

Dr Pandey says Kathmandu has no street signs.

"So it does make it difficult to actually locate many people, but people are doing the best they can," he said.

Dr Pandey is waiting on the arrival of a new baby and says it could happen at anytime, but is so pleased to be able help his country just when it needs him most.

Rotary has an account number at the Commonwealth Bank which has also been set up to help with donations from outside the town. The BSB is 082 922 Acct No 049060530.
