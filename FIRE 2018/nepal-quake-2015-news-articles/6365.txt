Fargo fire fighters responded to kitchen fire in an apartment Monday night. It happened at 909 University Drive North. Someone in the apartment had put water on the fire and then left. Fire crews finished extinguishing the fire shortly after they arrived at the scene. There were no injuries. The cause of the fire is under investigation.

An investigation continues at the Grand Forks Air Force Base after a call to 911 about a shooting. But the address was "not there." The airman associated with the call was "not listed" among personnel. Still, the base went into lock down.
