Philippine contingent to provide aid in Nepal







THE PHILIPPINES will send aid to Nepal, which experienced a massive earthquake that killed more than 3,000 over the weekend. A Philippine contingent will be traveling to Nepal to extend help to the quake victims, including Filipinos living there who were affected by the disaster.



“A team from the Philippine embassy in New Delhi, India is traveling to Nepal to meet the needs of our countrymen affected by the earthquake,” President Benigno S. C. Aquino III said in a statement read by Presidential Spokesperson Edwin S. Lacierda at a press briefing on Monday.



“The Philippine government will be communicating with our counterparts in Nepal to offer assistance. We are prepared to, and consequently taking steps to, render aid to the maximum of our limitations,” Mr. Aquino’s statement said.



More details will be released at a later time, Mr. Lacierda said.



On Saturday, a 7.9-magnitude quake struck around midday demolishing buildings and homes and triggering a monstrous avalanche in the country’s iconic mountain, Mt. Everest.



“In this time of great loss, Nepal is not alone. We are confident that, with the help of the entire world, they will be able to overcome this calamity,” said Mr. Aquino. “The Filipino people join the rest of the world in expressing sorrow and concern for our brothers and sisters in Nepal, as they contend with the destruction wrought by the earthquake.”



Citing figures from the Commission on Filipino Overseas, Mr. Lacierda said that there are 110 Filipinos residing in Nepal as of 2012. -- Alden M. Monzon
