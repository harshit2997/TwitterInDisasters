Pub quiz raises funds for Nepal

YVETTE BATTEN/FAIRFAX NZ Nepal Earthquake Quiz Fundraiser organiser Eloise Pollard with Red Cross Taranaki Service Centre co-ordinator Jess Burrows and The Good Home owner David Stones.

As soon as New Plymouth woman Eloise Pollard found out about the Nepal Earthquake she was on the phone trying to organise a fundraising event.

A magnitude 7.8 quake struck the country killing about 9000 people on April 25. Another 7.3 magnitude one hit on May 12 killing more than 125 people.

On May 14 she held a quiz with the support of The Good Home and raised $4400, which went towards the Red Cross Nepal Earthquake Appeal.

"I'm over the moon," she said of the outcome. "I think it's wonderful. I was just so stoked with how many people turned up and the spirit of it all."

Pollard was spurred into action because she has friends in Nepal. Ten years ago she volunteered in a orphanage in Kathmandu.

"Then I went back a couple of years later to visit. So I lived there for a few months with a local family in their home."

"I've still got some connections with some young people and my family over there. It is a personal thing for me and that's why I organised it [the fundraiser]."

She keeps in touch with the Sidgel family through Facebook. "They're safe. My family and the young people that I worked with are all safe.

"Their homes are a little bit damaged. They're sleeping outside and the young people who aren't from Kathmandu are all leaving to go back to their villages because of the fear of the spread of disease.

"I really do worry for their future back in the villages. There's no communication with them so there won't be a way of knowing how they're doing and they haven't heard from their families in the villages because of that."

She fears for the future of the people. "I experienced first-hand the lack of resources that families have there for the children, to clothe them and feed them and educate them.

"I can't really imagine the devastating effects of this earthquake on top of what already was a really tough situation for people."

Pollard and her friends are also supporting a 21-year-old young man in Nepal through university. He's studying to become an engineer.

About 150 people attended the quiz where donation buckets were passed around.

Taranaki Arts Festival donated two three-day passes to Womad 2016 and Joe's Garage donated several $50 vouchers for an auction.

She was grateful to The Good Home for their support. "They were really keen to support it because of a personal connection that they had with a staff member."

"I just want to say thank you to everyone who was so generous," she said. "I'm really humbled by the support."

Red Cross Taranaki Service Centre co-ordinator Jess Burrows, who attended the event, was pleased with the outcome.

"A hundred per cent goes towards Nepal," she said.
