Elderly Woman Rescued From Nepal Earthquake Rubble
</headline>

<text>
Rescuers saved an elderly woman from rubble on Tuesday following last week's deadly earthquake in Nepal.

It took volunteers more than a half hour to dig the woman out from under a collapsed building in Bhaktapur. It was not immediately clear how long she had been trapped beneath the fallen debris.

The woman suffered only minor injuries and is recovering well, The Guardian reported.

Other amazing rescue stories have emerged in the wake of the disaster, including a man who was trapped for 80 hours and a 40-year-old mother who was rescued after 36 hours.

The 7.8-magnitude earthquake and several aftershocks have claimed more than 5,200 lives. Hundreds of survivors protested in Nepal on Wednesday, demanding more recovery efforts from their government.
