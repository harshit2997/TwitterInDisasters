Members of Boston's Nepali community gathered in Copley Square Sunday night for a candlelight vigil to pray for the victims and survivors. The disaster hits close to home for many of them who still have relatives in Nepal.

"We are distraught…we are crying everybody," said Sot Ajay.

Deepak Dangol, who lives in Arlington, said his family back in Nepal is safe, but many can't go back to their homes. "The main thing is…national monuments are gone," he said.

Sandhya Ghimire says she has no idea what's happened to her distant relatives in the more remote villages, but she has been able to get in touch with her immediate family members in Kathmandu. And it's not easy for them. "They are in the ground, under the sky…noodles, dry food," she said.

Boston Mayor Marty Walsh told the crowd the city is showing solidarity with New England's Nepali community, which is estimated at some 40,000 in Massachusetts.
