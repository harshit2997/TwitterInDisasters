Liberman lauds ‘glorious Israeli’ seen in Nepal

Foreign Minister Avigdor Liberman says during a press conference on Thursday that Israel is helping the Nepalese people following the devastating earthquake last week “in every possible way.”

Liberman sends his “condolences and sympathies” to the Nepalese people, and said Nepal was “a very friendly country.”

The foreign minister thanked India and China, which, he said, helped in the efforts to rescue Israelis stuck in the country.

The foreign minister then referred to recent media reports that highlighted Israeli tourists in various places acting crassly and abusing staff at hotels and planes: “We talk a lot about the ugly Israeli. I want to talk about the glorious Israelis. We [have seen] the Jewish people at its best, Israelis acting responsibly toward one another.”

“How they helped each other, Magen David Adom, the Foreign Ministry, the Defense Ministry, the IDF and insurances companies: All cooperated and really did an outstanding job. The field hospital is a point of pride for Israel,” the foreign minister said.

The foreign minister boasted that other countries, including major powers, did not do “even a quarter” of what Israel has done so far to help both its nationals in Nepal and the locals hurt in the quake. He ended his comments with a wish that the last Israeli still missing, Or Asraf, will “come home safely.”
