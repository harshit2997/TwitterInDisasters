KATHMANDU, April 30 (Xinhua) -- The Armed Police Force (APF) of Nepal on Thursday managed to rescue a boy who was trapped inside a guest house of the capital for 120 hours.

Two teams of APF rescued Lama at 11:56 a.m. local time Thursday morning, exactly 120 hours after the 7.9-magnitude quake jolted Nepal on Saturday. The 15-year-old was found under the rubble.
