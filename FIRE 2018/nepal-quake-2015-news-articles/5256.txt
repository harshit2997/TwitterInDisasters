MUMBAI, May 8, 2015 /PRNewswire/ --

Waaree Energies Ltd. has dispatched over 1000 solar lanterns to be freely distributed to the earthquake affected families in Nepal. Once completely charged, these solar lanterns can work up to eight hours and they can also be used to charge mobile phones. This would provide the much needed respite to those who are stressed due to non-availability of power. Most of the earthquake affected areas are still under darkness, while power restoration work is underway.
