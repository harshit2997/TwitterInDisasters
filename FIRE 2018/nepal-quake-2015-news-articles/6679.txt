DEC Nepal Appeal funds can assist people affected by latest quake The DEC has this morning confirmed that its Nepal Earthquake Appeal will allow its member agencies to provide support to people affected by today’s [Tues 12 May, 2015] earthquake. Donations to the appeal will be accepted until 31.05.15 via www.dec.org.uk or by telephone on 0370 60 60 900.

The reported 7.3 magnitude quake (USGS – as of 10am BST) struck a relatively remote area 47 miles east of Kathmandu at 8.05am BST. DEC member agency staff in Kathmandu reported strong shaking in the city. There is a risk that some buildings already weakened by the 25 April quake will have collapsed.

The border town of Kodari was significantly closer to the epicentre and may have experienced very strong to severe shaking.

DEC Chief Executive Saleh Saeed said:

“We are very concerned about the potential impact of this latest quake on the people of Nepal and on the efforts of our member agencies to respond to the devastating 25 April quake.”

“DEC member agencies are now urgently seeking to assess the needs of those worst affected by today’s quake. They are also taking stock of any disruption that may have been caused to existing aid efforts.”

DEC member agencies and their partners have already reached over 300,000 people affected by the 7.8 magnitude 25 April earthquake. To date, the DEC Nepal Earthquake Appeal has raised £50m.

DEC member agencies that have confirmed this morning that they have spokespeople in Nepal available for interview and contactable via their UK offices include:

Concern - 020 7801 1855 Save the Children - 020 3215 3278 Tearfund - 0208 943 7986 Christian Aid - 020 7523 2460 British Red Cross - 0207 877 7095 CARE International - 0207 091 6047 Islamic Relief - 020 7593 3251 ActionAid – 020 3122 0635

Notes to editors:

· The fundraising total includes funds raised by the DEC secretariat and also funds raised by member agencies as part of the appeal. The DEC will regularly update the fundraising total on its website: www.dec.org.uk.

· The DEC is already publishing regular updates on the work of its members in Nepal: http://www.dec.org.uk/appeals/nepal-earthquake-appeal. The first major update on how DEC funds have been spent will be produced six months on from the earthquake on or just before 25 October 2015.

· The DEC brings 13 leading UK aid charities together in times of crisis: ActionAid UK, Age International, British Red Cross, CAFOD, Care International, Christian Aid, Concern Worldwide, Islamic Relief, Oxfam, Plan UK, Save the Children, Tearfund and World Vision; all collectively raising money to reach those in need quickly.

· All DEC agencies will support the appeal and are responding in Nepal.

· To make a postal donation make cheques payable to ‘DEC’ and mail to ‘PO Box 999, London, EC3A 3AA’.

· Donations can be made at any high street bank and at post office counters. To donate £5 by text, send the word SUPPORT to 70000. The full £5 will go to the DEC Nepal Earthquake Appeal. Donors must be 16 years or over and have bill payers permission. Texts are free and donations will be added to the bill.

· Aid delivered by DEC members and their partners has been paid for with DEC funds and money from other sources. Some people will have received different kinds of help from more than one DEC agency. For example it is likely that separate schemes - one providing shelter assistance and another providing food packages - will have reached some of the same people.
