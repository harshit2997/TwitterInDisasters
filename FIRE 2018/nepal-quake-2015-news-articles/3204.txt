Japan to dispatch SDF to Nepal, part of multifaceted aid effort
</headline>

The government said Tuesday it is sending 110 Self-Defense Forces troops to Nepal to carry out medical work as part of a multifaceted aid effort to the nation struck by a devastating earthquake on Saturday.

An initial party of around 20 personnel was due to leave Japan for Kathmandu late on Tuesday evening.

Other specialists already dispatched include around 70 personnel from the National Police Agency and the Fire and Disaster Management Agency, who tried but failed to reach Kathmandu Monday.

Separately, around 45 doctors, nurses and pharmacists were also due to depart Japan on Tuesday.

Meanwhle, in Tokyo, the Foreign Ministry announced a grant of ¥1 billion yen in emergency aid.

On Monday, a plane carrying the team of first responders tried twice to reach Kathmandu but failed to secure permission to land because of congestion.

On both occasions, it returned to the eastern Indian city of Kolkata, the Japanese embassy in Kathmandu said. Officials say they hope the team will be successful Tuesday.

The congestion was the result of aircraft heading to Kathmandu from around the world. The Japanese team’s aircraft had to circle in a holding pattern for some time, and when fuel became a concern it returned to India.

There are signs that Nepal’s government is having difficulty carrying out certain functions. This creates obstacles to foreign rescue teams setting up and carrying out their work.

Monday’s team of roughly 70 individuals is Japan’s first large-scale rescue mission abroad since February 2011, when Tokyo dispatched personnel to help after a powerful quake in Christchurch, New Zealand.

Meanwhile, the death toll in Saturday’s magnitude-7.8 quake continues to climb, with at least 3,500 casualties reported so far. There was a strong aftershock on Sunday.

Japan’s Embassy in Nepal said it has so far confirmed the safety of fewer than half of some 1,100 Japanese nationals living in the country.
