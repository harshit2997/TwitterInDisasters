After seeing thousands of people killed and injured we thought of helping the affected people. I put a word to my husband Pramod, a businessman, about our interest. Soon he sent mails to various hospitals in Kathmandu where injured are undergoing treatment. Chirayu National Hospital in Kathmandu replied to our mail seeking medical help. They requested us for specialist like surgeons, orthopaedicians, pediatricians, general surgeons and other specialists. Soon I contacted my friends and likeminded doctors immediately agreed. Some others will come in the second batch. A few are also coming from Kalaburagi, Vijayapura and Bengaluru."So far three doctors are in Nepal while nine will leave on Thursday and two others on Friday. They will be there for 10 days. The doctors will also be taking free medicines offered by many pharmaceutical companies.
