<text>
The Vietnamese Red Cross (VRC) has provided initial aid worth 30,000 USD to Nepal in order to support the country overcome the devastation caused by the 7.8 magnitude earthquake which struck on April 25.



The VRC announced the aid package on April 30. It will be transferred to the Nepalese people via the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies.



The VRC also plans to mobilise donations, aid materials and volunteers to join the rescue and humanitarian operations in Nepal.



On April 29, two missions from the Vietnamese Embassy in India left for Nepal in a bid to support and bring home Vietnamese nationals stranded in the country.



According to Vo Thi Kim Anh, a Vietnamese expatriate in Nepalâ€™s capital of Kathmandu, her family has supported 13 Vietnamese tourists who were stuck after the earthquake. Nine of them left the country safely on April 29.



Currently, Kim Anh is striving to contact other groups of Vietnamese travellers to confirm their condition and whereabouts.



The Nepal disaster has left more than 4,800 people dead and over 9,200 injured, while eight millions people have been affected across Nepal, according to an official report.-VNA
