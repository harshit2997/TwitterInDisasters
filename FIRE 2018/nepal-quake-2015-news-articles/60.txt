BK Rastogi, Director General of Institute of Seismological Research today said that people in Gujarat don’t need to worry about the earthquake in Nepal or even its aftershocks.

Rastogi said, “The magnitude of earthquake Nepal has witnessed can cause damage to 300 km area around the epicenter. Beyond 300 km, there can be impacts of earthquake but not damage. Gujarat is far away from Nepal, and people here don’t need to worry about either today’s shock or aftershocks.”

Rastogi said it has been observed in the past that aftershocks are lower in intensity compared to the original shock.

He however said that areas of Nepal, Uttar Pradesh and Bihar should take care for at least two days during which aftershocks can be experienced.

“Suppose if the main shock has caused some damage to weak buildings, the aftershock can cause further damage to same buildings, and therefore those living in weak such structures should leave them for at least two-three days in Nepal, UP and Bihar.”

Rastogi said, the earthquake in Nepal will not trigger activation of other fault line, so far as Gujarat is concerned.

Rastogi however said that Gujarat is vulnerable land so far as earthquakes are concerned and therefore buildings should be properly designed.
