Kolkata artists played silently inside the Rabindra Sarobar Lake at Jadavpur, showing solidarity with the Nepal earthquake victims. At around 5:00 pm, artists from across the city converged at the Lake and sang songs and hymns in memory of the people who died in the earthquake.

Just a day ago, artists had assembled at the Dakshinapan-Dhakuria and Jadavpur, and sang songs. They lit candles and silently remembered the lost in Nepal.

The Facebook page, ‘Kolkata 4 Kathmandu’ has been raising funds from across the city and have begun an initiative to send relief materials to Nepal.

The admin had earlier launched a drive to collect biscuits and other edibles to send them to Nepal.
