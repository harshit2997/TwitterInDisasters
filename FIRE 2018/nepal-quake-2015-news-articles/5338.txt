Medical teams and relief goods continue to be sent to quake-stricken areas, as search-and-rescue teams from 34 countries leave Nepal.



Wang Ping is the head of the International rescue team of the Red Cross Society of China.



Wang says local residents injured in the quakes need help, and his team has started medical services in areas around Katmandu that were severely damaged.



"From Labour Day, May 1st, we started to visit and offer medical services in areas that suffered much devastation from the massive quake. The medical team has aided over 700 wounded persons."



Wang adds that local residents have shown their kindness and strong will in the aftermath of the disaster.



"My deepest feeling is through the rescue work the friendship between China and Nepal has grown deeper. Also, I think Nepalese people are very kind, optimistic and strong-minded."



More non-governmental organizations will go to Nepal with relief goods.



Cai Peng, head of an NGO in Beijing, says the first priority in participating in the relief work is "offer help..."



"At present I'm preparing relief goods in Lhasa and I'll bring them to Katmandu tomorrow. And more will be transported to the city in several days. I'll also bring some cash. I will visit some places to see what help do they need. The aid work should be consistent. We have made a plan before joining in the relief efforts. Our principle is never mess up."



The United Nations said 8 million people were affected by the quake. And at least 2 million need tents, water, food and medicines over the next three months.
