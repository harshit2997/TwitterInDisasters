MANILA, Philippines–Heeding the call of Manila Archbishop Luis Antonio Cardinal Tagle, parishes under the archdiocese held a second collection during Masses on Sunday for thousands of quake victims in Nepal.

At the same time, Tagle also appealed to parish priests, rectors and chaplains to immediately remit the collection to the Manila Archdiocese’s accounting office or its social arm, Caritas Manila.

Earlier, the social action arm of the Catholic Bishops’ Conference of the Philippines (CBCP) launched a solidarity appeal for survivors of the deadly quake that hit Kathmandu on April 25, killing more than 6,000.

Caceres Archbishop Rolando Tirona, chair of the CBCP National Secretariat for Social Action, requested all 86 dioceses in the country to send help in the form of shelter kits, food and nonfood items, potable water and medicines as the need for these was growing in Nepal.

He added that donations may be sent to the CBCP’s Alay Kapwa account at the Bank of Philippine Islands (BPI): CBCP Caritas Filipinas Foundation Inc. with account number 4951-0071-08.
