India, Japan plan to restore Nepal’s cultural heritage
</headline>

A Japanese delegation arrived in India recently to discuss the restoration of Nepal’s cultural heritage following the recent earthquake.

Led by Kentaro Sonoura, Japan’s Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs, the delegation met with India’s Minister of Tourism, Culture & Civil Aviation, Dr Mahesh Sharma, for talks on a series of issues, including reconstruction projects.

Following the meeting in Delhi, Dr Sharma revealed that Japan had agreed to lend its support to the Archaeological Survey of India (ASI) to jointly assess the damage and help restore temples in Nepal. The ASI has already started restoration work on the Shri Pashupatinath Temple near Kathmandu, which was damaged by the quake.

Much of Nepal’s cultural heritage, including the UNESCO-listed landmarks at Kathmandu’s Durbar Square, was left in ruins by the 7.8 magnitude quake that rocked Nepal on 25 April.

Relations between India and Japan are currently on a high, following the recent state visit of India’s Prime Minister, Dr Narendra Modi, to Japan.
