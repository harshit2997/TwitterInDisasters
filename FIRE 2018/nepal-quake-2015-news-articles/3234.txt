This was followed by a presentation by LN Sharma, associate professor on "Earthquakes; A natural phenomenon: What's humanly possible".He spoke about how people can be more prepared before, during and after for calamities such as earthquakes and gave technical insights into the natural processes which trigger earthquakes. He said as much as 56% of India's land and the complete land area of Nepal are vulnerable to seismic activity. "The entire Nepal area is under the zone and prone to a high magnitude earthquake.
