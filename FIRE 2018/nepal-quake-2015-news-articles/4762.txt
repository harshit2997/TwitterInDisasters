KUALA LUMPUR: Authorities confirmed that the body found in Langtang on Tuesday evening is that of Sai Jaya Raj Anthony, one of the two Malaysians who went missing in Nepal.

Anthony’s brother Augustine flew to Kathmandu yesterday evening and has identified the body.

Malaysian embassy in Kathmandu charge d’affairs Fadli Adilah said closed consultations were conducted with family members since the discovery was made.

“Anthony’s brother has identified and claimed the body,” he said in a statement, adding that the embassy was assisting the family “in every way possible”.

“The family has not yet made a decision,” he said when asked if the body would be brought back to Malaysia.

Fadli added that there was an option for the body to be cremated.

Fadli said Anthony’s body was not found with his passport. The passport is missing.

“The embassy has notified the Nepali authorities and also reported the missing passport to the Malaysian Immigration Department,” he said.

Fadli said Interpol would be alerted to prevent Anthony’s passport from being misused by others.

“Our prayers and deepest condolences to the bereaved family. May his soul rest in peace, God bless, amin,” said Fadli.

Anthony, 38, a local award-winning DJ known as DJ Headmasta had gone missing four days before the 7.8-magnitude earthquake hit Nepal on April 25.

He was on a six-month holiday with friends and had visited India before splitting from the group and heading to Langtang Valley to trek.

The other Malaysian who remains missing is businessman Dennis Lee, 47, who travelled to Nepal to trek with a group of Filipino friends. He has not been heard from since April 5.
