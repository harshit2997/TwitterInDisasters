HK joins global relief efforts for quake-hit Nepal

The Hong Kong government and local charities and community organizations are seeking to do their bit in the global relief efforts for quake-ravaged Nepal.

The Leung Chun-ying administration announced Tuesday that it plans to donate HK$50 million to the Himalayan nation following the 7.9-magnitude earthquake last Saturday.

A proposal would be put forward to the Legislative Council’s Finance Committee to facilitate the donation, the government said.

Meanwhile, local charities and community groups are also pitching in with their own initiatives.

The Nepalese community in Hong Kong has initiated a donation campaign to assist those affected by their nation’s deadliest natural disaster in more than 80 years.

In other efforts, the Li Ka-shing Foundation has contributed more than US$1 million to Nepal, routing the donation through the nation’s consulate here, the Hong Kong Economic Journal reported.

Consular officials have sought donations of tents, blankets, medicines, food, water, water filters and face masks, among other contingency materials, to the affected areas.

The country also needs more rescue professionals and medical staff, they said.

A representative for the Hong Kong Integrated Nepalese Society was quoted as saying that they have received more than 30 cartons of clothes and other materials, including new blankets.

Hong Kong’s Nepalese population is estimated at around 30,000. Many of them have families and businesses back home.

Some have lost contact with their loved ones.

About 5,000 people are confirmed dead in the Nepal disaster, according to the latest figures. Officials have said the toll could reach as much 10,000.

Meanwhile, several thousands have been injured, missing or left homeless. Among the missing are eight Hong Kong citizens.

Christian organization Life Time has set up a hotline (8100-8012) to provide counseling services in Nepali language. The special service is available from 7 pm to 10 pm, Monday to Saturday. [www.life-time.org]
