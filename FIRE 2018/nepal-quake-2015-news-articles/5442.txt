Founder Sarah Griffith said it has been 'non-stop' as they research and monitor the situation after the devastation hit the country following an earthquake.

The total raised by yesterday afternoon was £69,718 and she believed it would reach £70,000 by the evening.

She and a team are leave Guernsey on Monday heading to Istanbul, where they will meet a team of medics from Seville who she has worked with before when helping in the Philippines. Then they will go on to Kathmandu.

Ms Griffith was 'really chuffed' that Channel swimmer Roger Allsopp would be joining her team, as well as architect Oliver Westgarth.

'I was specifically looking for an architect so they can look at buildings that are compromised.'

She said that the team would be doing aid work while it was there, but would also look for other projects that it could assist with in the long term.
