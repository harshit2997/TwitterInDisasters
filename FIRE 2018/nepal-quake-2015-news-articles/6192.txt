A U.S. helicopter with eight soldiers on board has still not been found, the government said on Wednesday. The helicopter, with six American and two Nepal Army personnel, had gone to Dolakha, epicenter of Tuesday’s aftershock, on a search and rescue mission.

It last came into contact with Kathmandu airport at 3 p.m. The strong tremor, of 7.4 magnitude, according to US Geological Survey, occurred at 12.50 p.m. Tuesday. The number of those killed in its aftermath rose to 65. Over 1900 have been injured.

Earlier Wednesday, Ujyaalo Online news portal said that the chopper had been spotted at Sunkhani village in Dolakha district. It subsequently quoted Home Ministry Spokesperson Laxmi Prasad Dhakal who said the U.S. helicopter is still missing. A search team has been dispatched from Kathmandu, Nepal Army said.

Nepal Police urged people not to share any “baseless” information. “We urge all (to) stop sharing/posting (earthquake) related baseless information on their social networks and prevent them going viral,” it posted on its official Twitter platform.

Rumors of stronger quakes did the round on Wednesday as well, adding to the panic. Many people stayed outdoors, with or without any shed or tent.

People had been staying in makeshift tents for over a week right since the earthquake of April 25. The quake and its aftermath has claimed more 8,000 lives and left over 17,000 injured.
