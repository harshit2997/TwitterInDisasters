The Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade is yet to confirm the death of an Australian among 19 people killed at Mount Everest's base camp.

Australian officials are trying to confirm reports a citizen is among 19 people killed at Mount Everest's base camp in an earthquake-triggered avalanche.

"The Australian embassy in Kathmandu is urgently seeking to confirm these reports," Foreign Affairs Minister Julie Bishop told ABC radio on Monday.

Temba Tsheri, a sherpa from the Dreamers' Destination Treks and Expeditions, says an Australian was part of his group on the mountain.

"I have lost four team members in the avalanche - two Nepalis, one Chinese and Australian," he said on Sunday.

A DFAT crisis response team has been deployed to Nepal to help establish the welfare of Australians unaccounted for.
