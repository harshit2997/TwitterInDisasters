Lefty Journo: Israel Visits Nepal Quake to 'Learn How to Kill Better'
</headline>

<text>
Leftist journalist Rania Khalek calls herself an "independent journalist" who writes for "Al Jazeera America, The Nation, Salon, AlterNet, Vice and more." She truly fits the name of her regular gig, the "Electronic Intifada."

.@MaxBlumenthal Did you ever consider that maybe Israel is heading to Nepal to learn from the earthquake how to kill better? â€” Rania Khalek (@RaniaKhalek) April 26, 2015

Commenters were pretty unsparing in response. One said "That maybe the most ignorant thing ever written on Twitter." Blumenthal was linking to an Agence France-Presse article on Yahoo:

Israel said Sunday it plans to airlift 25 infants from quake-hit Nepal born to surrogate mothers, along with their Israeli parents, most of them homosexual couples. Officials said Israel was sending a military delegation to offer aid and help repatriate its citizens from Nepal following the quake that has claimed more than 2,500 lives. The foreign ministry said there were 600-700 Israelis in Nepal, as well as the 25 babies recently born in Kathmandu -- four of them prematurely -- to surrogate mothers from India.
