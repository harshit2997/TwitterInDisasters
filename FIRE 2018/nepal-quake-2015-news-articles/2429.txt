Relief supplies from Taiwan to reach Nepal Tuesday: official
</headline>

<text>
Taipei, April 27 (CNA) A first batch of relief supplies from Taiwan will arrive in Nepal on Tuesday to contribute to relief efforts in the Himalayan country devastated by a magnitude-7.8 earthquake last week, Foreign Minister David Lin said Monday.



After checking with Nepalese authorities, Taiwan will be sending blankets, water, dried foods and medical supplies to areas recovering from the aftermath of the strongest quake to strike Nepal since 1934, Lin said at a press briefing.



Vice Premier Chang Shan-cheng said an eight-member advance team of medical and foreign affairs experts will also be on the plane with the humanitarian assistance to get a better feel for Nepal's medical needs.



Two medical teams organized by the Ministry of Health and Welfare and non-governmental organizations are ready to depart for Nepal at a moment's notice, Chang said.



Taiwan's representative to India, Tien Chung-kwang, who happened to be in Kathmandu at the time of the earthquake, has stayed on there to coordinate Taiwan's assistance both to its own nationals and to the victims, according to the vice premier.



The latest tally shows that 183 Taiwanese in Nepal at the time of the earthquake have been confirmed safe and 21 remain unaccounted for.



Because airports in Nepal have resumed operations, the Executive Yuan said it saw no need to launch a special operation to bring all of Taiwan's nationals home.



Foreign Ministry officials said they have been in contact with an international aid agency now working in Nepal, and Taiwan's NGOs will be informed when to depart once the international aid coordinator sees a need for the supplies.
