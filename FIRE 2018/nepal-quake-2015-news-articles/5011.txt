A Londonderry woman who was caught up in the Nepal earthquake has described how she narrowly escaped injury.

Amy Webster, 24, flew into Belfast on Monday afternoon to spend time with her parents.

Ms Webster was in a village three miles from Everest base camp when the earthquake struck.

"A lot of people were killed at base camp - I was so relieved that my boyfriend fell ill and we'd left there," she said.

More than 7,000 people died in the magnitude 7.8 earthquake. More than 10,000 people were injured.

The epicentre was in the Gorkha region, and many roads to the hilly district are impassable due to landslides.

Ms Webster said the moment when the earthquake struck was terrifying.

"The ground started shaking and someone shouted 'avalanche'," she told BBC Radio Foyle.

"We looked up and just saw a wall of snow coming towards us.

"It was terrifying. You don't know how solid it is when you see it coming towards you in a distance.

"At one point I thought that was it.

"The walk down the mountain was scary because we knew we were going down a path we weren't familiar with."

Ms Webster said they were relieved to have left the Nepalese capital Kathmandu on Monday "because aftershocks were still happening".

"We felt awful leaving the Nepalese people but we aren't the volunteers they need," she said.

"They need doctors to help them rebuild their lives.

"It's really nice to be back home to see my parents."
