Nepal, famous for its ancient religious culture and rugged human landscape, has long been regarded as a photographer’s creative paradise. After the devastating earthquake many have taken a fresh look at past photos of Nepal to again feel the warmth of the beautiful land. China Daily, together with China Photographers Association, has invited five renowned photographers to “return” to Nepal. Let us take another look at that stunning place, those clear eyes, while praying for the country. May all turn out well for those smiling faces in the photos. (Photo: China Daily/Zhang Yanhong)
