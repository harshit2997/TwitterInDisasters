The DDA has received a request to reconstruct a school building that was destroyed in the earthquake.

A team of 15 DDA officers which went to Nepal on May 5 returned home on Tuesday after providing relief material and assistance to the victims at a camp set up in Dhading village.

DDA Vice-Chairman Balvinder Kumar appreciated the efforts made by the officers and desired that these efforts should be continued and more officers should volunteer to go for relief work in the earthquake-hit areas.

He had earlier mooted the idea of DDA constructing houses for the quake victims in Nepal.

The DDA team had set base camp at Shree Ijara Lower Secondary School in Dhading and from there the relief material was distributed to the residents of nearby villages at Bagmati Zone like Bhulbhule.

Their efforts were appreciated by area in-charge Shanti Kumari Shrestha, the principal of Shree Ijara Lower Secondary School in writing. She has requested the DDA to construct the Lower Secondary School at Izara which has been completely destroyed in the quake.
