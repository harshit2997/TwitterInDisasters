Red Cross role for Rosevears woman
</headline>

<text>
ROSEVEARS woman Kym Blechynden will fly out of cold Launceston today bound for tropical Malaysia.

But the jaunt will be far from a relaxing holiday – Ms Blechynden will instead start work as the Asia Pacific emergency health co-ordinator for the International Federation of Red Cross.

Her role will largely focus on supporting Nepal following last month’s devastating earthquake which left more than 7500 people dead and about double that injured.

Ms Blechynden said she was called in to the Red Cross Kuala Lumpur office to co-ordinate a response to the basic healthcare needs of the population as well as disease prevention, disease surveillance and psycho-social support.

The nutritionist and public health expert received a phone call telling her of her deployment last week.

She said Nepal’s mountainous terrain provided unique challenges in providing aid.

‘‘We’ll be using helicopters,’’ she said.

‘‘A strength of Red Cross working in Nepal is that we have 6000 volunteers.

‘‘We have 300 staff providing support and many of those were working prior [to the disaster].’’

Ms Blechynden is no stranger to providing emergency assistance.

The University of Tasmania lecturer has clocked up 19 deployments to locations in Asia, Africa and the Middle East including stints in Syria, Chad and South Sudan.

She urged people to donate to the Red Cross appeal to help the organisation provide long-term assistance in Nepal.

‘‘The needs are going to be great for many years,’’ Ms Blechynden said.
