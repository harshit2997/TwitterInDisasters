Nepal Quake Death Toll Nearing 4000: Reports

The death toll of the massive earthquake that struck Nepal on Saturday has risen to more than 3800, reports quoting the Himalayan nation's authorities said.

More than 6,500 people have been injured, Nepal Home Ministry's national disaster management division chief Rameshwor Dangal was quoted as saying Monday.

In addition, thousands of people are reported to be without food, water or shelter.

The Guardian quoted an aid worker as saying that he feared that as many as 15,000 have been killed by the worst earthquake to hit Nepal for more than 80 years.

The earthquake of 7.8 magnitude hit Nepal with the epicenter about 60 kilometers outside the Kathmandu Valley. A total of 30 out of 75 districts of the country have been affected, the worst affected are Gorkha, Lamjung, Sindhupalchowk, Kathmandu, Bhaktapur, and Laltpur districts, across rural and urban areas. The Government has officially declared a state of emergency and asked for international humanitarian assistance.



The impact in capital Kathmandu includes collapsed buildings and walls, especially historical buildings in the city center, but overall less damage than what was predicted, WFP said. In the Kathmandu Valley, hospitals are overcrowded, running out of medicine, doctors and beds for the injured. Nepal's oldest hospital, Bir Hospital, has been treating people on the street.

The majority of the people are staying outside at night in order to avoid being injured from the aftershocks.

At least 940,000 children living in areas severely affected by the quake in are in urgent need of humanitarian assistance, says UNICEF.
