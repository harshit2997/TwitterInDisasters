WA teens missing in quake-hit Nepal

Three teenage boys in Nepal are believed to be the only West Australians who have not made contact with family back home.

Raoul Poncin, 19, Rin Hutcheson, 18, and Jalada Wilson, 18, from Fremantle have not been heard from since last Tuesday when they were hiking in Lampang National Park.

Freddy Poncin, Raoul's father, posted on Facebook on Monday that a man from Kathmandu trekking company Dal Bhat Power, who supplied the boys with equipment, was expecting them to return by mid-week.

The company is also sending people to find the trio and other trekkers in the region.

Jalada's mother Ida is expected to arrive in Kathmandu on Tuesday to help search for the teens.

Ian Wilson, Jalada's father, said on Facebook he hoped the boys were just stuck somewhere without access to a phone or the internet.

Dozens of West Australians registered as missing by loved ones on a Red Cross website have made contact with family and friends.

Lisa Anne Mirtsopoulos, 45, who was on the Monk for a Month tour, is still registered as missing but on Tuesday the company posted on Facebook that it believed all of its guests were accounted for.

Angus McDougal Caithness, 36, has also been reported by his trekking company as being safe at Mt Everest Base Camp.

Blake Penson, 34, managed to call his parents in Perth with a satellite phone from Mount Everest Camp 2, about 1000 metres above the first base camp, soon after the first tremor struck on Saturday.

His father Michael Penson said avalanches had destroyed the route between the bases but his son was OK.

Ballantyne Paige Forder, 22, Callumn Shally, 21, Shannen Wynne, 20, Brooke O'Keefe, 31, and Karen Lee Jury, 44, are also among those from WA who have been able to get in touch with family back home.
