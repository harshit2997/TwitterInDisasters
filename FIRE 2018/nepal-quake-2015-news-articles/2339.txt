Nepali family in Windsor worried about relatives in Kathmandu

<text>
A Nepali man who moved to Windsor with his family seven months ago is relieved his relatives are safe, but says the past two days have been extremely unsettling.

"I was trying to call my family, my in-laws no one was available," said Bhanu Dhungana, who is from Kathmandu. "Phone was very difficult to get in touch, like maybe there was a problem with the network."

After staying by his lap top looking for any news he could find, Dhungana said he confirmed both his and his wife's families are ok.

But an orphan who lived with them for several years is in critical condition.

Dhungana said he was told a wall fell on top of the child, leaving him with several broken bones and internal bleeding.

"Nothing is good with him...he is not well," he said.

People were reported dead in the house next to his family's.

"Two babies and one mother," he said.

Dhungana is also concerned he doesn't know the entire truth about how his family really is doing.

"They know I'm worried, okay, they know I'm worried about them so they will try to hide everything from me," he said. "I'm not sure, there's definitely something wrong going on, I feel like that."

For now, his family is staying in tents, behind his in-laws' house, and other family members are living in their cars to wait out the aftershocks and flooding.

Other Windsorites are safe

CBC News has also been indirectly in contact with a couple from Windsor who are in Nepal. The two are safe and hope to return home soon.

A mountain climber born in Windsor who was reported missing has also been found safe.
