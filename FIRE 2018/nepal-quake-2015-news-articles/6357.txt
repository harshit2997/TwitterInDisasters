Bahrain sends BD10,000 to quake victims
</headline>

<text>
NEARLY BD10,000 in cash has so far been donated by people in Bahrain to support victims of last month's devastating earthquake in Nepal.

This is in addition to 30 tonnes of humanitarian aid that Bahrain has sent with a team of volunteers, who are currently on the ground in Kathmandu.

Royal Charity Organisation secretary-general Dr Mustafa Al Sayed held a meeting yesterday to discuss further aid shipments in coming weeks.

He said the Bahrain rescue team was able to reorganise its priorities after touring the most badly affected areas.

"We have a second consignment of food ready to go, but we are waiting to purchase waterproof tents for shelter because this is the need of the hour," said Dr Al Sayed.

"The people of Nepal are resilient and brave - they were so full of praise for the effective care we could provide."

Meanwhile, Dr Al Sayed received a donation of BD1,500 yesterday from Bahrain's Soni community and another BD501 from the Rajasthani community.

The death toll of the 7.8 magnitude earthquake on April 25 now stands at 8,019, with 17,866 people injured and 366 still missing.
