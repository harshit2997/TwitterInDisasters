A year ago today, Matt Carapiet died when the 7.8 magnitude quake sent a piece of a glacier careering down a mountainside, causing rocks and boulders to crash down on to the village in the Langtang district in Nepal where he was staying.

Twelve months on, the 23-year-old’s family is looking to the future and planning ways to keep his memory alive.

Dad Greg said: “His loss was so sudden and unexpected that it left us reeling, not believing that something like this could ever happen to us. But it did and we are still trying to come to terms with it.

“This past year has been a very tough 12 months for all the family.

"It has been emotional and sad, but we have got through it, helped by looking forward to the happier events, which will be happening later on in the year.

“Our lovely daughter Chrissy gets married in August, to a terrific chap, Rob, and we couldn’t be more pleased.

“We are also planning a trip to Cambodia, to visit the school in Siem Reap where Matt volunteered and helped lay the foundations for a new school building.”

Family and friends raised £14,000 to help enable the school to be completed, and are now paying for a perimeter fence, a new drainage system, landscaping and training for the teacher who will run the school when the founder and current director retires.

Within the next few months the Carapiet family, including mum Jill, will publish a book detailing Matt’s travels around Asia during his gap year with his photos, sketches, extracts from his journal and tributes from friends and fellow travellers.

Profits will help those still trying to rebuild their lives in Langtang, which the family plans to visit next year.

Mr Carapiet added: “Thank you once again to all the kind and thoughtful people who have helped us during this past year, to the many organisations and businesses who have arranged fundraising events, and most importantly to those who have donated so generously during these events.”
