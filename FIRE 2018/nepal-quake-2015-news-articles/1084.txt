ALGIERS, April 26 (Xinhua) -- Algeria has sent medicines and 70 disaster relief rescuers to the quake-hit Nepal, APS news agency reported on Sunday.

The APS quoted Colonel Mustapha El Habiri, head of the country's firefighting department, as saying that 200 tents, 2,000 blankets and four tons of drugs have been sent to Nepal.

A staggering 7.9-magnitude quake, the worst to hit the nation in over 80 years, shook central, western, mid-western and far-western parts of Nepal at midday on Saturday, leaving tens and hundreds of people injured and causing damage to properties worth over billion U.S. dollars.

Nepal authorities said on Sunday that more than 2,430 people were killed in the massive earthquake.

Algerian rescuers are due to join international teams deployed in the devastated capital of Kathmandu in the hope of finding those who are still breathing under the rubbles.
