Nepal update

Teams are in or arriving in Lukla (Everest, Grand Journey, Mera & Island Peak) or Jugapani (both Dhaulagiri Circuit teams). There is a backlog of people waiting to fly out of Lukla to Kathmandu. As they have internet in Lukla, there is an appreciation of the scale of this disaster and Jagged Globe leader, Alex Langdon, says that everyone is being patient. The Dhaulagiri Circuit teams report little evidence of the earthquake on their journey from Italian Base Camp via Dobang.

Now we have some clarity, we can report that one of our Everest Sherpas, Chhimi Gurung, sustained a serious head injury and is currently being treated in Kathmandu. All of us here are very concerned about him, and as with all our team members we will give his family our assistance.

You can donate to Jagged Globe's charity, Sherpa Aid UK, to help the families of Sherpas who have been affected by the Earthquake. Please donate here.
