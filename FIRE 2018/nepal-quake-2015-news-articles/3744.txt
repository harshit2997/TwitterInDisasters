“India enlarges rescue operations in Nepal; sends Gorkha soldiers of Indian Army to Himalayan nation,” PIB retweeted an All India Radio tweet.

Tapping its 38,000-strong force of Gorkha soldiers, the Indian Army has sent “quite a few of them” to various parts of Nepal to ascertain the requirements in remote places.

Additional Director General of Military Operations Maj Gen Ranbir Singh said, “We have got a large number of Gorkha soldiers in the Indian Army who belong to Nepal. Quite a few of them have been sent to Nepal, to their areas, to physically go and ascertain what are the requirements,”.

Meanwhile, IAF helicopters evacuated 19 mountaineers from Nepal’s Lukla, even as 251 were rescued by land.

Nepal was hit by a devastating earthquake measuring 7.9 on the Richter Scale on April 25. The quake sent tremors across India as well. (IANS)
