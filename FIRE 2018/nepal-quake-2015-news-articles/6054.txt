GNWT commits $25,000 to Nepal earthquake relief efforts
</headline>

The GNWT has donated $25,000 to the Canadian Red Cross to assist with relief efforts after Saturday’s devastating earthquake in Nepal.

The 7.9 magnitude quake killed more than 6,200 people and left nearly 14,000 injured.

But officials say those numbers are conservative at best, and that the fate of thousands more remains unknown.

Earlier this week, members of the Canadian Red Cross were dispatched to Kathmandu, near the quake’s epicenter, to provide emergency assistance.

Premier Bob McLeod says it’s important for northerners to support those efforts.

“Northerners have consistently shown their compassion in times of crisis around the world,” said McLeod in a statement Friday.

“The Government of the Northwest Territories is proud to support the humanitarian relief efforts of the Canadian Red Cross in Nepal.”

The federal government meanwhile, says it will match individual donations and funds raised specifically for Nepal until May 25.
