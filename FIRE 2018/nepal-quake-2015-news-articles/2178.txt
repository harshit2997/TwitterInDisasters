Caritas Poland, The Polish Humanitarian Organization (PAH) and UNICEF Poland are collecting money to cover the costs of water, food and medicine.

By 2.15 pm Polish time, the death toll had risen to 3726, while more than 6500 have been declared injured.

UNICEF has estimated that at least 940,000 children need help as a result of the quake.

Besides those that are injured, many have been left homeless both in Kathmandu and the countryside.

81 firefighters from Warsaw, Gdańsk, Nowy Sącz, Łódź and Poznań have now arrived in Nepal as part of a HUSAR heavy search and rescue team.

They followed a six-man rapid response team of Polish medics, who arrived early this morning.

Those keen to donate for the Nepalese cause can make a transfer to Caritas Poland (Bank no: 70 1020 1013 0000 0102 0002 6526, with the reference 'Nepal'), PAH (Bank no:12 1140 1010 0000 5228 6800 1012, with the reference 'Pomoc dla Nepalu) and UNICEF Poland (Bank no: 41 1020 1013 0000 0702 0005 9055 , with the reference 'Pomoc dla Nepalu).
