The Foreign Office reportedly sent in the team by helicopter after the family of Matthew Carapiet from Bearsted, Kent, complained that the government was not doing enough to find him.

The 23-year-old had been hiking in the Langtang Valley north-west of Kathmandu, before the earthquake struck killing more than 7,000 people in Nepal and over 100 in India and Tibet.

A Foreign Office spokesperson told the Star: “We are in close contact with the Nepalese government.

“The British Embassy in Nepal is offering our assistance to the authorities and is providing consular assistance to British Nationals.”

The main team of Ghurkhas has reportedly been told that finding Mr Carapiet is a “high priority”.

They are receiving support from a second unit, containing officials from the Foreign Office’s emergency unit and more Ghurkhas, that is based in a town further down the hillside, Nuwakot.

Mr Carapiet graduated last year from the University of Nottingham and had been interning at Zaha Hadid Architects before completing his training.
