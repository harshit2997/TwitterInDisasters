A massive 7.4-magnitude aftershock jolted Nepal on Tuesday following the powerful 7.9-magnitude temblor on April 25, which has left more than 8,000 people dead.[Special coverage]

The latest earthquake, which occurred at 12:50 p.m. local time (0705 GMT), is centered 18 km southeast of Kodari with a depth of 15 km, the U.S. Geological Survey said.

Two aftershocks, including a 6.3-magnitude one, followed the major quake.

Panicked people rushed to open places and streets in the capital of Kathmandu.

Shristi Kafle, 24, tried to hold her tears while running out of a house.

"In the beginning, I thought it was just another small aftershock, but when I saw things on the table start to fall, I realized how powerful it is. I'm so scared and worried about people living in cracked houses," she said.

The tremor was one of the strongest aftershocks of the April 25 quake, which has killed 8,046 people and injured 17,866 others as of Tuesday.

The strong tremor was also felt across northern and eastern India.
