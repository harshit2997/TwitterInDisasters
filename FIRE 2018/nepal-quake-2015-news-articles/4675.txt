KUALA LUMPUR: The body of award-wining local DJ Sai Jaya Raj Anthony, who has been missing since the devastating Nepal earthquake, may have been found.

The authorities have found a body with Anthony’s passport in Langtang Valley, one of the worst-hit mountain villages, about 130km north of Kathmandu.

It was learnt that family members were informed of the discovery late Tuesday evening and his brother was scheduled to arrive in Kathmandu today to identify the body.

“I would like to confirm that a body from Langtang is being flown into Kathmandu. The body is believed to be that of Malaysian national Raj Anthony,” said a Nepal police official, adding that the body, believed to be that of the 38-year-old DJ, would be taken to the Tribhuvan University Teaching Hospital in Maharajgunj, Nepal.

The authorities also found another tourist, a 51-year-old German woman in Langtang.

A Malaysian embassy official in Kathmandu Fadli Adilah said the mission would assist the family in making any arrangements needed to send the body back to Malaysia.

All communications with Anthony were lost about four days before the 7.8 magnitude earthquake hit Nepal on April 25. He was on a six-month holiday with friends and had visited India before splitting from the group and heading to Nepal.

His last Facebook post indicated that he had planned to trek up the mountains in Nepal from April 21 to April 28.
