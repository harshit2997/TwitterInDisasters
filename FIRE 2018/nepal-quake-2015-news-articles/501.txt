News1st and the MTV/MBC media network have come forward to initiate a relief programme for the people of Nepal, who have been stricken by a major earthquake and its aftershocks.

Director of Public Relations at MTV/MBC Priyantha Wijeysinghe, elaborated on the initiative during the main news bulletin at 7 p.m. on Sirasa TV.

He said that they have witnessed the tragedy the people of Nepal are currently experiencing. He went on to state that it is an emotional time for all. He said that thousands have lost their lives owing to this earthquake while many have been rendered homeless and destitute.

Priyantha Wijeysinghe also noted that as a Buddhist country we consider Nepal as the birthplace of Lord Buddha. While the people of Nepal are facing much hardships at this juncture we cannot help but remember the catastrophic Tsunami incident which took place in 2004. He stated:

When we face such hardships many countries came to help us in order to get our country back on its feet.

Speaking further, he noted that The Capital Maharaja Organisation together with News 1st have organised a relief effort under the title Sri Lanka for Nepal adding that this relief effort came about at the last moment therefore they have partnered with several government institutions and diplomatic offices and are currently carrying out discussions to identify what items the Nepalese people urgently need at this movement.

Priyantha Wijeysinghe pointed out that they are ready to fly these items as as soon as possible with the assistance of Sri Lankan government officials.

Priyantha Wijeysinghe added:

Tomorrow we will inform you of the items we need. Be prepared. Do not bring these items to our head office: instead you have to bring these items to No 330, T.B. Jayah Mawatha. This is the very location that we collected goods during the Tsunami tragedy. No 330, Harrison’s Complex along Darley Road.”
