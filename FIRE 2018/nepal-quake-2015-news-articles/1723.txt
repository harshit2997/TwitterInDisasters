A Hoole woman has lost her mum in the earthquake that has killed thousands of people in Nepal.

Maya Shyangba Hyolmo, 30, is originally from a village called Sarka Thali Helambu which is in the Sindhupalchok region of the country, a few kilometres north east of the capital Kathmandu.

The Coleg Cambria hairdressing student says lots of the villages in that area have been completely destroyed by the earthquake and her mum Jangmu Sherpa was one of thousands to lose their lives in the tragedy.

The last time Maya spoke to her was via Skype on April 18 – the Nepalese Mother’s Day.

Maya says her dad Kaji Lama luckily managed to escape the 7.9 magnitude disaster, but has been left homeless.

She said: “My dad is lucky but he is not in (a) good condition. He has no food and no clothes and is living outside.

“I managed to speak to him this morning.

“He told me some people are still missing.”

Maya, who has a brother and sister living in Dubai, and another brother and sister in India, says she was told by her uncle not to go back to the country yet.

She said: “I would like to go and see my family but I’ve been told it’s not suitable. There are no roads and everything is broken.

“My younger brother who lives in Dubai flew back to Nepal this morning to be with my dad. I will go too when things settle down.”

Now Maya's friends, classmates and colleagues are pulling together to try and raise money for the victims of the earthquake.

Samantha Jones, of Flint , studies hairdressing with Maya in Connah's Quay.

At 10am on June 7, she will host a walk up Moel Famau for Community Action Nepal to help those like Maya’s dad who have been affected by the disaster.

More than 30 have already signed up for the event’s Facebook page and Maya says she has been overwhelmed by the kindness shown.

She added: “It is so kind of people to do this and I will be walking too. I’m really happy that everyone is trying to help and I know the people over there will really appreciate it.”
