Nepal earthquake survivor delivers healthy baby boy

A Nepalese woman who survived last month’s devastating quake now has one more miracle: a healthy baby boy.

The survivor — who was heavily pregnant when she was forced to dig herself out of the rubble after the April 25 earthquake — gave birth Wednesday, according to the British Red Cross.

Both mom, identified only as Dolma, and baby are doing well.

“This baby being born healthy is a sign of hope and second life for our whole family,” Dolma said in a statement posted to the organization’s Facebook.

The massive 7.8-magnitude quake, deemed the most divesting in 81 years, killed more than 8,000 people, injured thousands more and left many in the Asia nation homeless.

Dolma’s home collapsed in the quake, leaving her trapped and injured in the ruins, aid workers said.

"I was so worried about the baby that I did not care about my own health, even though I had wounds everywhere and had trouble breathing,” she said.

Miraculously, she was able to dig herself out, the Red Cross said. She moved into a temporary shelter and went into labor Wednesday. Aid workers drove her to a clinic, where she gave birth to her baby boy.

"Even though we lost almost all of our belongings and live in a temporary shelter, I could not be happier and more thankful for this little miracle,” she said.

Representatives from the British Red Cross could not immediately be reached for comment.

Two weeks after the April 25 quake, a second earthquake hit Nepal. That Tuesday tremor killed at least 42 people and injured another 1,100, officials said.
