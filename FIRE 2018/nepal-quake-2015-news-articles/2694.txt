How Delhiites can support relief efforts in Nepal

<text>
Everyone has seen the heart-breaking images of the aftermath of the powerful earthquake that shook Nepal. Three days after the devastating earthquake, which has displaced millions, people are suffering from the lack of basic amenities such as food, safe drinking water and shelter. Most of the citizens are living outside under the open sky in rain, or in camps/hospital tents, without access to food and clean drinking water.

Now, you the empowered citizen of India can also help our neighbour nation in crisis. 25-year-old Nikita Parmar has started a citizen’s initiative to collect food, drinking water and medical supplies, which will be sent to those ailing in Nepal and its inaccessible valleys. A lawyer by profession, Nikita has set up pick and drop facilities all over Delhi NCR where packaged food, water bottles and medical supplies can be dropped and picked up from.

“We are looking at sending packaged items, water bottles and medical supplies. We have already sent about 100 blankets and 2000 water bottles. But this is nothing in comparison to the numbers required there. So, every person can help make a contribution,” she said when contacted over the phone.

These supplies will then be sent to General VK Singh’s office and will be air-mailed to citizens of Nepal. According to the United Nations, about eight million people are in need of humanitarian assistance and about 1.4 million from these need immediate access to food.

You can contribute by sending:

Flash lights, solar lanterns

Packaged non-perishable food items like biscuits, nutrition bars

Blankets, water bottles

Hygiene products such as soaps, disinfectants, band-aid, bandages, sanitary napkins etc

If you are residing in New Delhi and want to contribute to relief measures in Nepal, you can do so by sending in your donations to any one of these centres (Lajpat Nagar, Mandi house, Sangar Vihar, Asaf Ali road and Ghaziabad) across Delhi NCR. For further details, please contact: 9811773216
