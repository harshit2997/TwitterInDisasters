Kathmandu: People from outer districts are unable to leave Kathmandu Valley due to a shortage of vehicles.

Harimaya Thapaliya, with her three daughters in tow, waited for nearly eight hours at Kalanki on Monday, hoping to catch a bus to Biratnagar, her hometown. A few buses drove past but none stopped.

“All the buses were already full,” said the 37-year-old mother.





“I lost all my belongings in the earthquake and now I would like to go home and be with my family.”

Harimaya and her three children were at Central Zoo in Jawalakhel, Lalitpur, when the quake struck on Saturday. The house she was renting in Ason was reduced to rubble.

Harimaya and her children spent two nights at Tundikhel under the open sky, scared for their lives as a series of aftershocks continued to rattle Kathmandu Valley and the districts nearby.

“We left Tundikhle and headed for Kalanki early in the morning to board a bus to Biratnagar, where my husband and in-laws are waiting. But not a single bus stopped for us,” said Harimaya.

Like her, scores of people from outside Kathmandu Valley waited in vain at Kalanki for passenger buses to take them home.

Suraj Khanal, 25, of Fujel, Gorkha, could not get a bus either.

He said his parents and younger sister had been out of contact for the past two days and he was worried about their wellbeing.

Sapana Kharel, who had come to Kathmandu to prepare for the IELTS test from Palpa, said she could not even get a taxi, let alone a bus.

“My parents are worried and I am scared,” said the 21-year-old.

Following the earthquake, the number of people trying to leave the area has increased dramatically.

But many of them are unable to leave because many buses that were supposed to arrive in Kathmandu from different parts of the country cancelled their scheduled trip in the wake of the earthquake.

Tulasi Prasad Sitaula, secretary at the Ministry of Physical Infra­structure and Transportation, said most taxi drivers in Kathmandu were from places affected by the earthquake and they had left to be with their families. — The Kathman­du Post / Asia News Network
