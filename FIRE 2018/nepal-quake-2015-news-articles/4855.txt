A New Zealander feared missing in Nepal after a large earthquake struck the nation has been found, but two more are still unaccounted for.

Doug Erin Sealy (31) from Wellington, was feared to have been in Nepal when the 7.8 magnitude earthquake hit the region, devastating large areas of the country on April 25.

Mr Sealy's mother Marie Grant contacted the New Zealand Herald to say the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade (Mfat) had told her her son crossed the border on April 26 into India and was thought to currently be somewhere in India.

"I am so relieved he missed the quake," she said.

Mr Sealy was volunteering as a teacher in India, and had travelled to Kathmandu to renew his visa.

Ms Grant said Mfat had been "great" and keeping in contact with her once or twice a day with the latest updates.

Peter Joseph Curreen, 63, from Marlborough, and Peter Donald McLeod, 62, from Taupo, are still believed to be unaccounted for, but Mfat said it "does not hold grave concerns" for the missing men.

"We have now confirmed the wellbeing of around 260 New Zealanders in Nepal with only a few New Zealanders unaccounted for," a ministry spokesman said in a statement.

"For privacy reasons we are not releasing details of individuals.

"With respect to New Zealanders unaccounted for, the ministry is in touch with family members who have provided us with contact details.

"Consular staff are actively engaging with local authorities in Nepal and continue to follow up leads including those being provided by families."

Anyone who has concerns about a relative believed missing in Nepal, and who is yet to inform Mfat, is asked to contact 04 439 8000.

The ministry advised against all tourist and other non-essential travel to Nepal.
