S. Korea to send disaster response officials to Nepal By KH디지털2 Published : May 13, 2015 - 09:20

South Korea will dispatch a "rapid response team" Wednesday to Nepal reeling from a new earthquake and aftershocks, officials said.



The three-member group will gather information on damages there to help determine whether South Korea needs to send another batch of search and rescue workers.



It will also check the safety of around 600 South Koreans residing in the Himalayan country.



"So far, there have been no reports of any South Korean victims," a Foreign Ministry official said.



A 7.3-magnitude quake struck Nepal Tuesday, killing dozens of people and more than 1,000 others injured, according to local authorities.



South Korea earlier sent a 54-member disaster response team of rescue workers and medics to Nepal shortly after it was devastated by a powerful quake late last month. (Yonhap)
