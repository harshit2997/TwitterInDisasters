Nepalese students held a vigil to mourn those killed and to pray for survivors of the Nepal earthquake.



TOLEDO -- The Nepalese Student Association at the University of Toledo held a candlelight vigil Monday to mourn those killed in the Nepal earthquake.





The students were joined by other members of the local Nepalese community plus students from many other backgrounds. Most of those at the vigil said their families are safe. They used the gathering the encourage an international effort to send aid to the stricken country.







"I feel helpless," said Niraj Gupta of the student organization. "I need to do something but I cannot offer anything except my prayers."









"One of our friends' uncle was (killed)," said Dr. Naba Raj Poudel, a postdoctoral researcher at UT. "It's a very difficult situation."









Many of the participants at the vigil held pictures they had printed from the chaos in Nepal.









The organization is urging the community to donate to relief efforts.
