KATHMANDU: A third batch of medical volunteers of senior doctors and specialists have arrived in the Republic of Nepal to work within the UAE medical volunteers' team, who are providing therapeutic services for people affected by the earthquake that killed about 8,000 people and injured other 17,000.

The move follows the initiative of the Zayed Giving Initiative, Saudi German Hospital and Dar Al Ber Society, and with the strategic partnership of Kathmandu University Hospital.

Dr. Reem Osman, Executive Director of the Saudi-German Hospital, and ambassador of humanitarian work, said that the third batch of medical volunteers reached Nepal to join the UAE-Nepalese joint medical team, which has been operating for several weeks to ease the suffering of hundreds of people affected by the quake.

She stressed that none of the UAE volunteers were affected by the strong new quake that hit Nepal yesterday, measuring 7.3 on the Richter scale.
