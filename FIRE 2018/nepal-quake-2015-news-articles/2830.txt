Kathmandu, Nepal (KRON) — Two Bay Area men hiking in the Himalayas are victims of the Nepal earthquake that claimed the lives of thousands on Saturday.

On Sunday, Google identified one of the victims as Dan Fredinburg, and executive at the company and Mountain View resident. On Monday, Vinh Truong of Sunnyvale was identified by the State Department as the second victim.

As the death toll climbs, four Americans–including Fredinburg and Truong– at the base camp of Mount Everest are confirmed victims of the 7.8-magnitude quake, according to the U.S. State Department.

A friend of Truong’s for a decade, Michelle Fennessy, said today he was an avid outdoorsman who dreamed of hiking the Himalayas.

“I’m almost envisioning him getting up on that mountain at base camp at awe of himself that he actually made it,” Fennessy said.

Fennessy and Truong met at the University of Chicago where they were both doing cardiovascular medical research. The two remained close throughout the years, even after Truong returned to the bay area to care for his family.

Truong, who was in his late 40s, worked at Kaiser Permanente Medical Center in Santa Clara, the hospital confirmed today.

A statement released by Kaiser stated, “Vinh Truong was a Kaiser Permanente employee and our hearts go out to his family and friends, and to everyone who is affected by the terribly tragedy in Nepal.”

Kaiser spokesman Karl Sonkin said, “Kaiser Permanente has extended its condolences and sympathy to the family.”
