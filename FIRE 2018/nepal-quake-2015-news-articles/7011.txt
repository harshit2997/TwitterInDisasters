NBC News crew briefly detained in Nepal for using a drone

An NBC News crew was briefly detained and questioned in Nepal for using a drone.

The crew, led by correspondent Katy Tur, was using a drone while reporting on the disappearance of a U.S. Marine Corps helicopter that had been delivering aid to earthquake victims, a network spokesperson told the On Media blog on Thursday.

In the video above, forwarded by an anonymous source, a Nepalese policeman apprehends an NBC News cameraman holding the drone and takes him to a police van. The crew was released shortly thereafter.

"The team was released without incident. They were not arrested or fined. The drone was returned to the crew," the spokesperson said.

The crew continued reporting after the incident and produced a package that ran on NBC's "Today" show on Thursday.
