Body Of Missing Israeli Hiker Found In Nepal
</headline>

<text>
Jerusalem — The last unaccounted-for Israeli following the earthquake in Nepal was found dead in the remote Langtang area.

The body of Or Asraf, 22, was located Sunday morning, the Israeli ZAKA rescue and recovery organization announced. It likely will not be recovered until Monday, when a “complex extraction” will be attempted on a rocky mountainside, according to ZAKA.

Asraf had been traveling with members of his former Israeli army unit, but left for a hike on his own shortly before the quake hit on April 25. The death toll as of Sunday morning was over 7,000. Hundreds of Israelis were in the area at the time of the quake.

Prior to finding Asraf’s body, rescue workers found documents belonging to him. Asraf had been traveling for several months since his release from army service with the elite Egoz unit. He was injured during last summer’s Israeli military operation in Gaza.

His father, Patrick, and several army comrades had arrived in Kathmandu last week to join in the search. Patrick Asraf had vowed not to leave Nepal without finding his son.

Israel’s Foreign Ministry has not been able to confirm the discovery of the body. It reportedly was identified by his army commander, who was taking part in the search.

Meanwhile, three people were pulled alive from the quake’s rubble, including a 101-year-old man. Aftershocks from the 7.8 magnitude temblor continue to roil the area.
