Eighty tourists from the State who were stranded in earthquake devastated Kathmandu will be reaching their native places by Tuesday afternoon.

Of them, 60 medicos already boarded Yeswanthpur-Gorakhpur and would be reaching by tomorrow morning while travel arrangements have been made for another 20 people from Guntur, who are staying at Gorakhpur, according Disaster Management Director K. Dhanunjaya Reddy.

In all, 33 people returned to their natives places from Nepal since Sunday.

“We booked air tickets to 14 tourists, including five from Visakhapatnam and sent them to their hometowns on Monday,” he said adding that 19 of them already reached their homes on Sunday. A four-member group from Gandhinagar in Vijayawada will reach the city by Tuesday evening.

Mr. Reddy said the government would continue its efforts to bring all the tourists stranded in Nepal. Even as control room set up by the State Disaster Management Department continue to receive distress calls from worried families, the government is leaving no stone unturned in identifying the people stranded in Nepal, said another official.

More than 400 people could be still trapped in Nepal and owing to problems in communication network, the administration was unable to trace them, another official added.
