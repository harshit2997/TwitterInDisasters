Bengaluru, May 1: The Advanced Light Helicopters (ALH) Dhruvs, from the hangars of Hindustan Aeronautics Ltd (HAL) have once again proven their mettle as a mean machine during emergencies and hostile conditions.

"Once again Dhruvs are standing up to its reputation as a very effective flying machine during emergencies. Our Dhruvs so far have cumulatively completed close to 50 sorties clocking around 80 hours," Raju said.

He said the sturdy choppers have been used for movement of equipment, logistics and evacuating people from the earthquake affected areas.

"We are extremely happy to see how the Nepalese Army is using the Dhruvs for undertaking various missions. If you see the track record of Dhruvs in the last 10 years, they have played extremely critical role during all natural disasters in India," Raju added.

India had recently handed over a Dhruv to the Nepalese Army as well.

A company spokesperson said that the Dhruvs have stood apart from other rotor platforms during tsunami missions in Tamil Nadu (2004), the flash floods in Leh (2010), the earthquake in Sikkim (2011), the massive rains in Uttarakhand (2013) and the flash-floods in Jammu & Kashmir (2014).

Over 140 Dhruvs are currently in operation.
