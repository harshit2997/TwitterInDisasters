Dillingham Marine travels to Nepal on humanitarian mission
</headline>

<text>
A U.S. Marine from Dillingham arrived in Nepal last week as part of a humanitarian mission to help the country recover from the 7.8 magnitude earthquake that struck April 25, killing nearly 8,000 people and injuring 17,000 more.

Dillingham's Lance Corporal Sheldon Nelson is a tactical switch board operator with the 7th Communications Battalion, which is attached to the third Marine Expeditionary Force in Okinawa, Japan.

Lance Cpl. Nelson said in an interview via satellite phone that his unit's mission in Kathmandu is "to get communications up and running so we can contact and interact with other units, so they can go out and provide humanitarian aid to the Nepalese."

Nelson's family reports that when a second, magnitude-7.3 earthquake hit on Tuesday, he did feel the tremors from his station at the embassy in Kathmandu.

He expects to be in Nepal as long as necessary to provide aid to those affected by the natural disaster.

"I'm more than proud to come out here and do what I can," he said. Nelson added a greeting to his family and friends back in Dillingham: "I love and miss you guys, and I'll see you soon."
