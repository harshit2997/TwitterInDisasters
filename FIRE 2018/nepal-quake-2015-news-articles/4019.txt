A 7.9 magnitude earthquake struck Nepal’s Kathmandu valley on Saturday, the death toll has crossed 5000 and is still counting, Nepal PM said the toll may cross 10,000. India instantly took action, Prime Minister Narendra Modi had called Nepal’s President Ram Baran Yadav and Prime Minister Sushil Koirala to offer help and support. And four hours after the quake struck, four Indian Air Force planes were on their way to Kathmandu’s Airport with blankets, a mobile “field hospital” and search and rescue teams, India launched operations Maitri.

Ambassador-designate of Nepal,Deep Kumar Upadhyay also expressed concerns on “congestion on Kathmandu airport” that was hampering taking aid to the victims. He thanked India, saying “India took the initiative in relief operations, which other countries followed. We are thankful to the government of India that it was kind enough to extend a ‘blank cheque’ after the shattering earthquake. It has done tremendous work to provide help,”

Operation Maitri is about relief, rescue, rehabilitation and evacuation of not only the local Nepalese or other foreign nationals, including Indians, affected by the earthquake but its major component also happens to be evacuation of stranded Indians.

China too has stepped in with aid and relief for the Nepalese and so has Pakistan. Western powers like the US, UK, Canada and European Union too have sent aid to Nepal worth millions of dollars.
