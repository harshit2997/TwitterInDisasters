HISAR: A native of Hisar safely returned to his hometown from the earthquake-ravaged Nepal along with his wife and children. Narendra Bansal, who had been into trading clothes in Nepal for the past one year, returned to India after being airlifted by the Indian Air Force.Talking to TOI, Bansal said, "I was on way to Pashupatinath temple for paying obeisance on my bike when I felt the ground shaking. I saw people running out of their houses shouting ï¿½bhukamp aya bhaago' (run, its an earthquake). I stopped my bike and ran to a flat surface and started thinking of my family. When I reached home, I found no one inside the house. My wife Rinku Rani, my son Aman, 8, and daughter Ambika, 5, were sitting in a park along with other families."Bansal said he and his family spent two days in the open in Nepal ate only noodles. "I am staying with my family in Nepal from the last year. After earthquake, everyone was moving towards Nepal's airport. I also reached there on April 26 at about 10 am. An IAF plane rescued us."
