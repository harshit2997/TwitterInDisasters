quake relief pm appreciates cooperation of states

New Delhi: Prime Minister Narendra Modi today appreciated the cooperation of states and the role of the NDRF, media and other agencies in the wake of the devastating quake in Nepal that also hit India.

“To all those saying #ThankYouPM- appreciate the sentiment...real thanks should be to our great culture, which teaches us ‘Seva Parmo Dharma',” he tweeted.

“If we want to thank anyone, it should be the 125 crore people of India who have made Nepal's pain their own & extended all help,” Modi said.

The Prime Minister also saluted the resilience of “our sisters & brothers in Nepal & parts of India, for their courage in the face of disaster”.

Thanking the state governments for their cooperation, he said it is a major asset in such times. The Prime Minister also appreciated the role of the armed forces, NDRF teams and the media.

“We must thank our armed forces, NDRF teams, doctors & all those volunteers who are overcoming every obstacle to restore normalcy in Nepal.

“Mention must be made of the media. They are bravely covering the disaster from the ground. Thanks!” he said.
