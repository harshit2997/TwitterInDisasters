New Delhi: Less than a month after a devastating earthquake hit Nepal, another earthquake measuring 7.1 on the Richter scale, epicentred in the neighbouring country, shook Delhi, most of northern and eastern India, including Bihar and West Bengal, and even some places in the south. It left 17 persons dead, including 16 in Bihar, and injured 39 others while triggering panic.

Indian Meteorological Department director-general L.S. Rathore has said that the aftershocks could continue for weeks or even months. The Centre activated the national helpline number 1078 and put the National Disaster Response Force and the Indian Air Force on full alert and on standby to respond to any emergency call from Nepal.

In contrast to Indiaâ€™s swift response to the April 25 Nepal quake, New Delhi has decided to wait for Kathmandu to seek its help through diplomatic channels. However, India has decided to give visa-on-arrival, both at airports and land entry points, and establish a mission desk at its embassy in Kathmandu to coordinate aid and relief work. Home minister Rajnath Singh spoke to Indian ambassador to Nepal Ranjeet Ray and took stock of the situation in Nepal.
