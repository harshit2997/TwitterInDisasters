Iceland offers humanitarian assistance to Nepal

Mr. Gunnar Bragi Sveinsson, Minister for Foreign Affairs, has decided to donate 10 million Icelandic kronas to humanitarian assistance through the International National Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies in response to the devastating earthquake that struck Nepal yesterday.

The Nepalese government has declared a state of emergency in the affected areas and requested assistance from the international community. It is clear the earthquake has caused considerable loss of life and destruction. The death toll has reached over 1500 and the number of dead is likely to continue to rise. Many people are injured and in urgent need of medical care. There is also an acute shortage of all basic necessities, such as food, access to clean water and emergency shelters.
