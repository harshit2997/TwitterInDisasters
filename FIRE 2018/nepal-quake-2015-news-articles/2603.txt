EUREKA, Calif. - A Humboldt County man who was in Nepal during a 7.8 magnitude earthquake on Saturday is in good health.

His wife, Jill Creech, said Dave and his friend Neal Carnam left for a backpacking trip two weeks ago and were on the trails when the earthquake hit.

"So when the earthquake hit they were out here, and had to trek back," Creech said. "But luckily they, you know, these, these guides are good and then they've got everything they need on their back, you know, 'cause they're backpacking."

Both Humboldt County men could be home as soon as Thursday.

Governor Jerry brown approved the deployment of the Urban Search and Rescue Task Force.

Fifty-seven Californians will travel to Nepal to assist local emergency operations in and around the hardest hit areas there.
