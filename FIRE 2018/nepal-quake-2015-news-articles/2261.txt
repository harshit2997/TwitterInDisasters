Nepal tries to recover as aftershocks keep tensions high

Traumatized Nepalese cremated the dead and dug through the rubble searching for survivors Sunday following a cataclysmic earthquake that killed more than 3,000.

Ongoing aftershocks terrified people in Kathmandu, many of whom opted to sleep in the streets rather than risk reentering buildings that remained standing.

With each mega-tremor — some of which hit a magnitude of 6.7 — howls of terror echoed throughout the devastated capital city.

“The aftershocks keep coming . . . so people don’t know what to expect,” said Sanjay Karki, Nepal country head for global aid agency Mercy Corps.

“All the open spaces in Kathmandu are packed with people who are camping outdoors. When the aftershocks come, you cannot imagine the fear. You can hear women and children crying.”

Tens of thousands of Nepalese spent Saturday night outside under chilly skies, or in cars and public buses.

They were jolted awake by strong aftershocks early Sunday, which did not result in reports of any injuries or deaths.

“There were at least three big quakes at night and early morning. How can we feel safe? This is never-ending and everyone is scared and worried,” said Kathmandu resident Sundar Sah.

“I hardly got much sleep. I was waking up every few hours and glad that I was alive.”

The relief effort was underway as aid workers from neighboring countries struggled to do their jobs given the poor Himalayan nation’s decimated infrastructure. Most areas were without power and water. Hospital were overcrowded and running out of supplies and space to store corpses.

With search and rescue efforts far from over, it was unclear how much the death toll would rise.

Authorities feared they would discover even worse devastation closer to the earthquake’s epicenter about 50 miles northwest of Kathmandu.

Roads to that area were blocked by landslides, hindering rescue teams.
