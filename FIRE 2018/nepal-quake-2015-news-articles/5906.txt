Dramatic footage of the Nepal Earthquake emerges

Sydney Morning Herald Various security cameras around Kathmandu reveal panic and carnage as buildings collapse under the force of the earthquake.

Dramatic footage has emerged of the moment Nepal was struck by the 7.8 magnitude earthquake that has since claimed more than 5000 lives.

One video, taken in Kathmandu, shows the front of a temple collapsing on at least one passing motorist, who attempts to jump from his open-air vehicle at the last moment. The falling structure spreads debris and dust over the busy street.

Another collection of clips reveal the instinctive response of the Nepalese to an earthquake, with locals stopping their vehicles and resting motorbikes on the ground as soon as the rumblings begin. People then huddle in the middle of the street, away from buildings.

The Age A tourist in Bhaktapur, a short distance from Kathmandu, films the moment the devastating earthquake hits the city causing thousands of deaths and widespread damage.

And in another film, a shrine in the middle of a roundabout collapses, while people cling to a gate for stability.
