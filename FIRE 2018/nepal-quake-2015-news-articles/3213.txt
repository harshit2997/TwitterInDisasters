MENLO PARK, Calif. (CBS) — Facebook is encouraging its nearly two billion users to donate to relief efforts in Nepal.

The social networking site has added a message at the top of its news feed urging its members to donate funds to help the hundreds of thousands of people affected by Nepal’s 7.8-magnitude earthquake.

The company says 100 percent of donations will go to International Medical Corps and their work in response to the Nepal earthquake. Facebook will also donate $2 million to local relief efforts.

Over the weekend, Facebook activated “Safety Check” to help people in affected regions inform others on the site about their safety.

Facebook says “Since then, millions of people have been marked safe and tens of millions of people were notified that someone they know has been marked safe.”
