With the deployment of Indian Army in the rescue efforts in Nepal, the paratrooper brigade of Agra has also dispatched its jawans to assist in the relief mission. A group of these elite soldiers reached Nepal on Monday in IL-76 and AN-32 aircraft, flying from Agra Air Force Base.

The 50th (I) Para Brigade of Agra is one of the finest paratrooper units of the country and has participated in many wars, including the 1965 and 1971 wars with Pakistan and the Kargil war. The paratroopers of Agra were also instrumental in preventing the overthrow of Maldives President Abdul Gayoom's government by the LTTE. These jawans are specially trained in relief efforts and are occasionally called in on relief missions across the country.

According to the local army sources, the entire rescue operation is being monitored from the Hindon Airbase in Ghaziabad. On Sunday, the military officers, doctors and field hospital members were dispatched to Nepal from Agra and an AN-32 aircraft was also sent, filled with necessary stuff like medicines and food. However, the flights had to turn back due to bad weather and then again left for Nepal at 5pm.

Meanwhile, schools in Agra remained closed on Monday and will be closed on Tuesday as well, with the concerned administration of the city declaring a two-day off for all schools in the district.

Talking to India Today, Ashish Goswami of Belanganj area said most of the houses in old Agra are old and in serious need of repair and restoration, but their owners are not in a condition to afford this repair. "In such condition, an earthquake of 6 scale or above could be deadly for the entire old city. It was a miracle that there wasn't much damage and no lives were lost directly due to the quake," Goswami said, adding that although the shaking of the ground has stopped now, the locals are still afraid to sleep in their houses and are taking all possible measures to protect themselves from a night quake.

Rajesh Goyal of Tajganj said a lot of old houses in Tajganj are currently serving as tourist homes and guest houses. "Tourists living in such houses are especially vulnerable to a quake of 6 magnitude and above as the entire building could collapse in such cases and rescue efforts in the narrow lanes of Tajganj are next to impossible," he said.
