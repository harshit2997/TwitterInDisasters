Candle-lit vigil for Christchurch Nepalese community

Celebrated Kiwi mountaineer Mark Inglis will speak at a candle-lit vigil to support Christchurch's Nepalese community tonight (Friday).

The local Nepalese community will host the vigil at Victoria Square starting at 6.30pm with the Christchurch City Council and Student Volunteer Army.

They will pay tribute to the 5858 people have died after a magnitude-7.8 earthquake devastated the region on Saturday (NZ time), leaving thousands more injured and homeless.

Inglis, a double amputee who conquered Mt Everest in 2006 after losing his legs to frost bite in a 1982 expedition on Mt Cook, will speak at the event.

He will be joined by professor Rajesh Dhakal, president of the New Zealand Nepalese Friendship Society, and mayor Lianne Dalziel.

Candles will be available for lighting at the vigil.

The Student Volunteer Army will collect donations for recovery work in Nepal.
