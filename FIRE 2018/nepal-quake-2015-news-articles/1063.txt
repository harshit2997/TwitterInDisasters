Israeli Defense Force Delegation En Route To Assist Nepal Earthquake Victims
</headline>

<text>
Following the tragic earthquake which shook Nepal yesterday claiming the lives of thousands and leaving many injured in a swathe of destruction, Israel is joining the international effort to offer relief to victims of the quake, as an Israeli Defense Force delegation heads out to Nepal.

Ahead of the team heading out for their mission, Brig. Gen. Dr. Dudu Dagan of the IDF Medical Corps spoke at a briefing about the field hospital his forces plan to build at the disaster site.

The Jewish State is world-renowned for dealing with emergencies, as well as for setting up small and effective field hospitals just about anywhere and fast.

As Dagan said, the field hospital the IDF intends to set up would be a tertiary hospital, “meaning we can operate, we can have intensive care, we can hospitalize, and even escort…the injured to Israel.”

At the same time, Col. Yoram Laredo, the commander of the Israeli delegation to Nepal said that even arriving safely to assist will be a challenge as Kathmandu airport was heavily damaged in the earthquake.

Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu spoke with Laredo on Sunday, telling him “you are being sent on an important mission. This is the true face of Israel – a country that offers aid over any distance at such moments. Good luck. We are counting on you.”

The President of Israel, Reuven Rivlin also spoke with various members of the delegation, which will see 260 Israelis going to Nepal to do what they can to assist.

“My blessings go to all the team undertaking this brave and humanitarian mission. I am proud of you and your staff for their speedy and impressive enlistment at such a time of need. This delegation of ‘messenger angels’ represents the universal values, in the spirit of our people and our country, and through you, I wish to thank each and every one of them.”
