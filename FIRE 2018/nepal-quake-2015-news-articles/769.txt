Fifty five tourists from Telangana and Andhra Pradesh, who were stranded in Nepal after the devastating earthquake were evacuated from Kathmandu by a special Indian Air Force rescue aircraft on Sunday morning.

These tourists including 35 from Telangana were brought to New Delhi early Sunday morning. All of them were brought to Telangana and Andhra Pradesh Bhavans in New Delhi where the Resident Commissioners of TS and AP were making arrangements for their onward journey to Hyderabad.

Telangana Resident Commissioner Shashank Goel told The Hindu over phone on Sunday that 35 tourists from Telangana including a group of 25 booked by Saibaba Travels from Hyderabad have been brought back safely. “We also had some other Telugu tourists, who did not go in groups,” he said adding that all of them managed to reach the Kathmandu airport and boarded the special flights to New Delhi.

“We are in the process of booking air tickets for the tourists. In all likelihood they will be sent back today itself in all available flights,” Mr. Goel said.

In the meantime, the two Resident Commissioners released a list of tourists, who had come back to New Delhi. They include 35 from Hyderabad and 19 from Andhra Pradesh. There are tourists from Maruteru, Ravulapalem, Velaguleru in Andhra Pradesh.
