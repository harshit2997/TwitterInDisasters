WICHITA, Kansas – It’s been just over a week since a massive earthquake hit the country of Nepal.

The death toll has now reached more than 7,000 people.

Nepal native and Wichita State grad student Nayan Shresta received a call from a friend Saturday morning after the earthquake hit.

“It was so devastating knowing that Kathmandu infrastructures were down, the next immediate response was getting a hold of my family,” said Shresta.

Shresta says the cell phone network in Nepal was jammed up from everyone trying to reach their family members.

“It was like the most terrorizing three hours of my life, not knowing how your parents would be, not knowing how your family members would be,” said Shresta.

For Nepal native Jay Maineli, he says his wife was in downtown Kathmandu when the quake hit.

“She’s still shocked, and she still hasn’t talked to me about all the details she saw,” said Maineli.

In hopes of bringing awareness to the destruction to their homeland and to raise funds for relief efforts, the Wichita Nepalese Community, along with the American Red Cross held a candlelight vigil at Wichita State University Sunday evening.

More than 350 people, most made up of the entire Nepalese community were in attendance.

Candles were lit to honor those affected by the earthquake.

T-Shirts and candles were sold to patrons and donations were taken, something volunteers like Shresta say will help will the long-term repairs to the country.

“Most of the funds would be required for the reconstruction part so our goal is to help doing the reconstruction of the country,” said Shresta.

The Wichita Nepalese Community with the support of the Red Cross say 100 percent of the proceeds will go to the relief effort in Nepal.

If you would like to donate to the relief efforts, the Wichita Nepalese Community has an account set up on their Facebook page.
