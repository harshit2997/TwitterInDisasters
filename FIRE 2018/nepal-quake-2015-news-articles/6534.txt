Nepal earthquake: US Marine helicopter missing in aid mission
</headline>

<text>
A US Marine Corps helicopter providing aid assistance in Nepal has reportedly gone missing, confirmed US officials.

The Huey UH-1 Marine Corps helicopter disappeared while conducting disaster relief operations in the aftermath of the Nepal earthquake near Charikot on Tuesday (12 May), Navy Capt. Chris Sims told AP News.

Charikot, located about 131 kilometers from Kathmandu, is one of the areas worst hit by Tuesday's (12 May) earthquake.

Six US Marines and two Nepalese soldiers were on board the missing helicopter that was a part of the Marine Light Attack Helicopter Squadron 469, said US officials.

Investigations are currently underway to determine the whereabouts of the missing helicopter, however due to nightfall, search has been put on hold at the moment.

US Army Col. Steve Warren said a nearby helicopter had overheard on radio the Huey UH-1 helicopter to be having possible fuel problems.

The likelihood of a crash is currently not being considered since no smoke has been detected.

Death toll on the rise

A second major 7.4-magnitude earthquake hit Nepal on Tuesday (12 May) killing an estimated 37 people and injuring several thousand others days after the 7.8 magnitude earthquake that killed an estimated 8,046 people.

The National Emergency Operation Centre in Nepal reported on the casualties following the second earthquake.

The second strong earthquake has further left residents terrorised with several people reportedly taking shelter in tents and pipes, too scared to stay indoors.

Meanwhile, Brian Baptie, head of Seismology at BGS, told IBTimes UK: "We can't predict earthquakes.

"We can make forecasts for the probability of earthquakes over longer periods of time, so this is long-term forecasting or seismic hazard. But in terms of being able to say exactly where, when and how big the next earthquake at any place is going to be we're a very long way from that at the moment."
