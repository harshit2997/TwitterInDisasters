"Volunteers are working day and night for the rehabilitation of the earthquake victims. The first phase of providing relief is going on and the second phase, in which we will rehabilitate the victims, will start soon," he said.On how Khalsa AID is providing relief in Nepal, he said they are providing the victims medicines, water, food and other things needed daily. "Our volunteers belonged to Punjab, Jammu, Delhi, and even the UK," he said. "Our team had 25 volunteers."Gursahib said they were providing temporary structures for housing right now, but would help build proper houses in the long run. Asked about the areas in which they had worked, Gursahib said their teams had reached some of the worst-hit areas around Bhaktapur. "Now, it's vital we strengthen our relief teams present in Nepal.
