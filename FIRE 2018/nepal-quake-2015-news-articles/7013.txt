A worker in Peterborough has spoken of the devastation he saw during his week as part of a humanitarian rescue effort following the Nepal earthquake.

Adam Turner, who works at Cotswold Outdoor, Peterborough Road, Eye, was part of a 16-strong charity Search and Rescue Assistance in Disasters team, based in Kathmandu.

Adam (23) from Spalding said: “I was part of a logistic support team helping with the communications between teams tasking, home and the United Nations.

“The scenes of devastation were overwhelming. There are a lot of displaced people living in the streets.”

Dad Kevin (pictured) was especially pleased to see Adam home earlier this month.

He said: “I’m relieved but very proud.”
