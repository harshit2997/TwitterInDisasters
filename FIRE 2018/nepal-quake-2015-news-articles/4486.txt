Fear disease outbreak: Dr Mridul Deka

Dr Mridul Deka of DFY, in a telephonic interview, tells dna's Maitri Porecha the challenges faced by the doctors conducting relief work in Nepal.

1. What were your first impressions while landing in Nepal on Monday?

On my way to Kathmandu from the airport, I noticed 90% percent of the buildings were damaged. Number of affected people has risen to 80 lakh. People are still living outside of their homes for fear of another quake. Tremors are being felt every day. Most injured have fractures or lung injuries due to smoke or dust inhalation.

2. What are the living conditions of the people?

Filthy. Thera are barely any sanitation facilities. Most Kathmandu go to public toilets or nearby schools. In rural areas, open defecation is rampant. Bouts of viral diarrhoea and fever are breaking out, aggravated by unseasonal rains. Tuesday saw torrential rains for an hour and drizzle for two hours. We fear measles outbreak due to shortage of vaccines and contamination of water resources. Nights are as cold as 11 degrees Celsius. The ground is damp. Children are falling ill.

3. What is the Nepal government's response?

Some 30 of Nepal's 75 districts have been hit, with 11 needing relief on priority. In Kathmandu, Lalitpur, Gorkha and Sindhupalchok, people are disillusioned, with no coordinated response. While on paper, the government has deployed local doctors, doctors have not reached the camps. There are no medicines, bleaching powder, chlorine tablets for decontaminating water. Health staff and equipment are in short supply.

4. How are international agencies helping?

Rescue workers, doctors and paramedics are pouring in from all over the world, and have to register with the Nepal government. International associations are awaiting instructions from WHO and the government for deployment. After I submit the ground report, we will ask for 10-15 doctors from India to be deployed for relief work.
