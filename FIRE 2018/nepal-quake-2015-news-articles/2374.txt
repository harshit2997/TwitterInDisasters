MANILA - "My heart breaks."

This were KC Concepcion's words in appealing to Filipinos to help survivors of the 7.8 magnitude quake that devastated Kathmandu, Nepal, last Saturday, which left at least 3,200 dead as of Monday.

A National Ambassador Against Hunger for the United Nation's World Food Programme (UNWFP), Concepcion visited the impoverished nation in 2012 -- a mission she recalled fondly in an Instagram post Monday.

"To the beautiful people of Nepal: You deeply touched my heart in so many ways, when I spent days and nights there 2 years ago," she said. "My heart breaks as I see the news of the aftermath of this earthquake."

The 30-year-old actress added: "To all the children and mothers we met on our U.N. mission, to the families and survivors of this tragedy, please know that my thoughts, condolences, prayers & love are with you all.

"Also, to our UNWFP friends I am so relieved to know you are safe! To the rest of Nepal, our team is on the field and we will take care of you best we could. Stay strong. Stay gentle, kind, hopeful. God bless you, Nepal. You are beautiful."

Concepcion, who just recently launched with Chameleon Philippines a new campaign to help girl survivors of sexual abuse, also appealed to her million-strong audience on Instagram to support relief efforts for earthquakes victims in Nepal, including UNWFP's emergency operation.

Amid news of devastation in Nepal, Concepcion and photographer Mark Nicdao, who documented her visit to the Himalayan nation, on Monday shared photos of "the most gentle people" during the 2012 UN mission. Here are some of them:
