MUMBAI: Ghatkopar's Brahman Samaj Hall has been teeming with activity ever since a massive earthquake rocked Nepal on April 25. Thousands of 'theplas' and tonnes of 'sukhdi', both Gujarati delicacies with long shelf lives, are being dispatched from this central suburb to Kathmandu every day.Soon after the earthquake struck, Gokul Vraj Foundation started to roll out its relief package. Mangal Bhanushali, a member, said, "Since food was scarce in Nepal, we appealed to people through Whatsapp to provide theplas and sukhdi as an extension of India's Operation Maitri to help Nepal. Food items are transported to cargo centres and railway stations in tempos or personal vehicles more than thrice a day. Customs officials are helpful and the airlines too fly out the food for free."In all, nine centres have been opened across Mumbai and people can pick a drop-off point for their food parcels at a centre closest to their house. In the northern suburbs, Pawan Dham, Kandivli, collects the parcels which are dispatched to the main centre at Brahman Samaj Hall in Ghatkopar (E). Here these parcels are sorted, packed and dispatched via cargo through air. In Nepal, the food items are collected and distributed via Seva Bharati.Bhanushali said that as many as 8,000 households in Mumbai were supporting the endeavour. Gayatri Bhadra, a volunteer said, "We spend close to 8-9 hours a day sorting out the parcels. They are packed in waterproof material to prevent rain damage."
