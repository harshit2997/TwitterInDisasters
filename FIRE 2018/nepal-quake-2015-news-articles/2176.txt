How Tough Is It Reporting From Remote Or Disaster-Ravaged Areas?
</headline>

<text>
A Saturday earthquake in Kathmandu, Nepal, left thousands dead and leveled many homes and buildings. Government aid workers and non-governmental organizations have swooped in to assist survivors and clear wreckage as aftershocks subside.

Charlie Sennott, head of the GroundTruth Project, joined Boston Public Radio to talk about the Kathmandu quake, as well as the CIA's drone program, the 1915 Armenian genocide, and the Clinton Global Initiative.

All answers edited where noted [...], and questions are paraphrased.

How do reporters cover the Kathmandu earthquake, given the tough terrain and adverse circumstances?

It's not easy, particularly there. You're dealing with some of the most remote terrain in the world. People are doing a good job covering this story. [The] skillset you need to go do that reporting and to do it on the ground is difficult. You have to be not only trained in technology — so you can get your SAT phone working, you can actually get communications going because communications systems are largely broken down — you have to know how to do things like operate a generator, because there's no energy.

Nepal is a particularly poor nation — we hear about destitute sherpas accompanying Mt. Everest expeditions.

Nepal is struggling to get from the global category of least-developed nation to a developing nation. They're not even there as a developing nation. [...] The country itself is so poor, so remote. [...] There's this vast income inequality. I'd argue though that that is probably part of the tradition of mountaineering and climbing and expeditions, [...] and it has been for a very long time, for generations.

We've seen this in other parts of the world during natural disasters, like Hurricane Katrina disproportionately affecting New Orleans' poor.

Right now the thing to question is other vulnerabilities. Where else are we not paying attention? [We see] vulnerabilities in a scattering of islands throughout Asia and through the Pacific that need great attention to what is going to happen if — God forbid — another tsunami [hits].

What did you make of Pres. Obama's admission that US drone strikes killed an American and an Italian citizen in Pakistan?

I was very surprised. [We're dealing with] the morality of using drones to target people as extra-judicial killing when a long time ago [Pres. Carter said,] 'no more assassination or extra-judicial killing.' We're back 100 percent. We just call it a drone strike instead of an assassination or a coup. [...]

I've spent a lot of time in Afghanistan, I've spent a lot of time in Iraq. We've seen the darkness we face. [...] I think that we are in a war that requires enormous thought, and it requires great challenges. It's going to absolutely challenge every fiber of the way we think about who we are.
