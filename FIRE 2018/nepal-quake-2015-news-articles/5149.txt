The devastating earthquake in Nepal literally brought their world crashing down.

Members of the Buduga Jangala community, who had migrated to the Himalayan country where they eked out a living in astrology, as sellers of gemstones and herbs, and even as labourers, have returned to their village in the district.

. Some of them do have their homes here, and others live in those of their relatives. But, around 30 families have no roof over their head. The men go out into the forests and collect firewood and the womenfolk cook food under the shade of the trees.

The district administration has provided each family Rs.1,000 in cash and 50 kilograms of rice. Even this, only the first batch of returnees was entitled to, and the others denied.

Gandham Ramaswamy, who returned from Kathmandu, said he had migrated along with his family and to eke out a living as an astrologer. After witnessing the devastating earthquake, he decided to return home.

The community is now seeking the government’s help in restarting their lives all over again. They have urged the government to allocate houses and also employment opportunities in the village. Sarpanch K Saraiah said he had conveyed the plight of the community to the revenue authorities and urged the administration to provide them shelter and employment.
