</headline>

<text>
ALEXANDRIA, Va., May 4, 2015 /PRNewswire/ -- FedEx has just announced they will provide $50,000 to The Salvation Army following the devastating Nepal earthquake that occurred April 25. The financial support will allow experienced Salvation Army emergency response teams to continue delivery of shelter, food, hydration, and emotional and spiritual care to survivors.

"During times of disaster, it is crucial for our response teams to provide relief as quickly as possible, and supporters like FedEx ensure that we have the means to do so," said Lieutenant Colonel William Mockabee, Executive Director of The Salvation Army World Service Office (SAWSO). "Monetary support of this kind not only goes toward providing relief immediately following a disaster, but allows us to serve long after to make sure that communities are rebuilt. Our efforts in Nepal will likely span the coming months and even years."

FedEx has a 14-year history of supporting The Salvation Army during national and international disasters. Previous gifts have included transporting relief supplies, emergency equipment and other disaster-related materials. FedEx has also provided 20 canteens, or mobile feeding units, through the years â€“ valued at $100,000 per canteen.

Monetary donations are the most critical need for survivors. The Salvation Army has set up a designated fund for relief efforts in Nepal.
