A 47-year-old Northern Illinois University professor teaching at Kathmandu University of Management in Nepal for a semester as a Fulbright Scholar escaped Saturday’s devastating earthquake unharmed.

Mark Rosenbaum, who lives in Naperville, was sitting inside his apartment when the massive 7.8 magnitude earthquake hit around noon local time.

Rosenbaum told WGN News that he sprinted outside his building. His building was not leveled, but was badly damaged.

Prior to going to Nepal in January to teach, Rosenbaum told WGN via Skype that the Fulbright program prepared scholars for the possibility of a major earthquake. So when the earthquake hit, he didn’t panic but grabbed his laptop and flash drive.

Conditions in Nepal were already difficult but the devastation from the quake has made conditions for the people living there harder.

Unlike many of the citizens, the U.S. State Department, which oversees the Fulbright Scholar program, found new accommodations for Rosenbaum and the other scholars at a nearby hotel.

The death toll in Nepal now stands at over 4,000.

Rosenbaum hopes to finish his teaching commitment before returning to the United States in June.

Watch Rosenbaum tell his fascinating tale to WGN.
