Grim sights as earthquake aid worker pitches in
</headline>

<text>
Dead bodies and crushed vehicles are commonplace among the debris that has become Whangarei aid worker Donna Collins' workplace in Nepal.

The women's health nurse and midwife left the country on May 1 as a New Zealand Red Cross aid worker and she is part of an assessment team visiting remote areas around Kathmandu Valley.

A powerful earthquake two weeks ago killed more than 4000 and injured thousands more in the low-income economy.

There are 261 Red Cross aid workers from around the world and more than 7000 volunteers from Nepal Red Cross.

On Wednesday, Ms Collins' team tried to get to Tatopani in the district of Sindhupal near the border with China but the road was blocked by rock fall.

Instead, they got to another village by walking a few kilometres. "We passed a crushed vehicle in which three people had been killed.

"The locals had buried them temporarily there until their families in Kathmandu could make funeral arrangements.

"Sadly, we also spotted a waterlogged body in the river caught in rocks on the far side, so we took GPS coordinates for the police to recover him.

"We traversed enormous fallen boulders, and saw across the river from us the massive valley sides continually slid miles down into the river, causing masses of dust clouds."

Ms Collins said damaged buses, four-wheel-drives, cars and motorbikes showed people were going about their usual business when the quake struck.

She said many people and families were walking out with meagre belongings on their backs and were eager to share their experiences and local knowledge with the assessment team.

People were going into their dangerously unstable housing to collect bedding and precious items, she said. "Resulting from our assessment, today (Wednesday) a team from the Canadian Red Cross team will set up a health post there and the road is now accessible, so these devastated people will get much needed and appropriate support," she said.
