Nepal's Prime Minister Sushil Koirala was in Thailand when the 7.9-magnitude earthquake rocked his country. He came to know about the temblor though the tweets of his Indian counterpart Narendra Modi.

This was revealed by none other than Prime Minister Modi himself when he was speaking to mediapersons in Madhya Pradesh.

Modi had also called Koirala in Thailand, offered his condolences over the loss of lives in the earthquake and offered all help to overcome the crisis.

In an unofficial and casual chat with journalists that continued for 25 minutes, Modi said when Nepal was struck by the massive earthquake, PM Koirala was in Thailand.

Modi said he has been a 'pracharak' for the last 40 years and he comes to know about several developments through this network.

Koirala went to Bangkok from Indonesia after participating in an international conference. He was to return to Kathmandu after a stopover for medical treatment in a hospital in Bangkok.

As soon as he landed at the Bangkok airport, Koirala saw Modi's tweets on the quake.

"Then we started seeking details," Nepal's Minister for Foreign Affairs Mahendra Bahadur Pandey said.

"We called Nepal and got updates regularly. I was also informed about the quake after going through Modi's Twitter account," he said.

"We really appreciate what Modi is doing for us. The kindness and affection he is showing to us is amazing," he said.

India was the first country to send aid and relief materials in Nepal.
