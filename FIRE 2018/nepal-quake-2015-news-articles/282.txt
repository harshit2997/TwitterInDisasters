Four Muhlenberg College students studying in Nepal were safe and fine Saturday after a 7.8 magnitude earthquake left about 1,000 people dead in the region.

All of the students had made contact with the college or their families by Saturday afternoon, said Donna Kish-Goodling, economics professor and dean of global education at the Allentown school.

The quake, centered outside the capital, Kathmandu, rattled parts of Nepal, India and Bangladesh. It also toppled buildings and triggered an avalanche on Mount Everest.

Three of the Muhlenberg students — a woman and two men — were in Kathmandu at the time, Kish-Goodling said. The fourth, a man, had traveled to India on an assignment. They are spending the spring semester in Nepal through a program of the School of International Training. Three are studying Tibetan and Himalayan studies. One in a program called Development and Social Change.

The United States is sending a disaster response team and $1 million in aid to Nepal. The White House and Secretary of State John Kerry are offering condolences along with the support.

Kerry said USAID is preparing to deploy the response team and activating an urban search and rescue team.

A powerful earthquake struck Nepal Saturday, killing at least 1,180 people and triggering a deadly avalanche on Mount Everest. It was the worst quake to hit Nepal in decades.

On Mount Everest, where climbing season is at its height, at least 10 people were killed and others were stranded at the perilous Khumbu Icefall, Nepalese officials and climbers reported.

"Running for life from my tent," Romanian climber Alex Gavan said via Twitter, describing the avalanche as huge.
