KATHMANDU: There may still be time to save lives — that’s why governments, including that of Pakistan, and aid organisations rushed doctors, volunteers and equipment to Nepal on Sunday without waiting for the dust to settle.

Substantial logistical hurdles remained, but there were hopeful signs as Kathmandu’s airport reopened after Saturday’s crushing earthquake.

Rescue and medical teams were deployed or were being deployed, among others, by governments of Pakistan, India, United Arab Emirates and Israel and aid organisations of the United Kingdom, Germany and France.

For its part, Pakistan sent two C-130 aircraft carrying doctors and paramedics, search and rescue teams, and relief goods. The two aircraft were also carrying a 30-bed hospital, medicines, tents, water and dry food.

The Pakistani ambassador to Nepal and other staff of the embassy were present at the airport to extend logistical support to the Pakistani relief assistance team.

In Islamabad, Foreign Office spokesperson said the Pakistan Army, Pakistan Air Force, National Disaster Management Authority, the embassy of Pakistan in Kathmandu, the embassy of Nepal in Islamabad and the Nepalese authorities were all cooperating in this regard.

Another two C-130 aircraft carrying relief goods would reach Kathmandu on Monday, an official said.

The International Search and Rescue Germany said a team of 52 relief workers, including doctors, experts trained in searching for people buried under rubble and several dog squads, were flying to Nepal on Sunday. The team would bring a mobile medical treatment centre.

Spokesman Stefan Heine said the priority was to get to the scene of the quake as quickly as possible to find those still alive.

The United Arab Emirates deployed an 88-member search-and-rescue team, and the Emirates Red Crescent also sent a team.

The Israeli military said it was sending a 260-member mission to Nepal to provide immediate search-and-rescue help and medical aid.

European nations deployed missions as well.
