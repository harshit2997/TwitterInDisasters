People of Nepal desperately need your help, says party’s Crisis Relief Squad chairman Lua Choon Hann.

KUALA LUMPUR: MCA’s Crisis Relief Squad has set up the “Nepal Earthquake Relief Fund” and has urged generous Malaysians to donate to help ease the plight of the victims there.

“The Malaysian government is doing its part by sending medical and rescue teams to Nepal and we too can play a role,” said Crisis Relief Squad chairman Lua Choon Hann in a statement yesterday.

The disaster is severe and the number of casualties is increasing, added Lua.

All donations will be handed over to the Nepal Embassy here.
