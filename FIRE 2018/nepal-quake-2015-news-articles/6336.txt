Kathmandu - The death toll from another powerful earthquake centred in Nepal has passed 80, authorities said early on Wednesday, with reports still coming in of landslides and further casualties.

Some 65 people were killed in Nepal alone by the 7.4-magnitude quake and aftershocks which hit after midday on Tuesday, authorities said, as the country struggled to deal with the mass deaths and damage caused by a 7.8-magnitude quake last month.

About 17 people were reported to have died in India, mostly in the state of Bihar on Nepal's southern border, and one person was dead in China after the latest quake.

Nearly 2 000 people were injured, police spokesperson Kamal Singh Bam said, with the worst-hit areas being Dolakha and Sindhupalchowk districts north-east of the capital, the border of which was measured as the epicentre.

Many villages in Sindhupalchowk district were flattened by the April 25 quake, which killed over 8 000 people and destroyed an estimated half a million houses.

Rescue workers were removing debris in the town of Chautara in Sindhupalchowk, the UN reported. Many people spent the night outside for fear of further aftershocks, the UN's Office for the Co-ordination of Humanitarian Affairs said on its Twitter feed.

Tuesday's quake set off at least a dozen landslides in six districts, raising fears that the death toll would rise.

"I held on to the kitchen door, but it rattled like it would fall," said one survivor in Kathmandu, Geeta Khadka. "Then I ran out to see the buildings swing," she said.
