WASHINGTON â€” U.S. officials say a U.S. Marine Corps helicopter providing assistance in the wake of the Nepal earthquake is missing.

Navy Capt. Chris Sims says the Huey was conducting disaster relief operations near Charikot, Nepal, on Tuesday.

The aircraft is part of Marine Light Attack Helicopter Squadron 469. U.S. officials would not say how many people were on board the helicopter. CNN reports the helicopter had as many as eight people on board at the time. Some 300 American personnel are on the ground in Nepal.

The incident is under investigation.
