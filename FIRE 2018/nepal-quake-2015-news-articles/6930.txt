Caritas PH calls for more Nepal aid

MANILA, May 10, 2015—NASSA/Caritas Philippines has renewed its plea to each diocese in the country to send donations for the families affected by the earthquake that hit Nepal recently in view of the increasing need for more shelter kits, food and non-food items, potable water supply, and medicine.

“The United Nations’ Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (UN OCHA), together with hundreds of other international humanitarian organizations, has already coordinated and deployed emergency rescue and relief efforts and activities,” shares Caceres Archbishop Rolando J. Tria Tirona, who also directs Caritas Philippines.

Growing need

“In response to the growing need of our brothers and sisters in Nepal, the Caritas Internationalis confederation has also launched an emergency appeal to support relief and recovery efforts,” he adds.

The 7.9 magnitude earthquake brought the Himalayan country on its knees on April 25, and left 4,200 people dead as of April 28.

Government authorities fear the number of affected people is bound to rise as aftershocks continue to strike.

Social action

Also known as the National Secretariat for the Social Action, Justice, and Peace (NASSA), the agency is the social action arm of the Catholic Bishops’ Conference of the Philippines (CBCP).

As a member of the global Caritas network of humanitarian agencies, donations it receives will be channeled towards Caritas response.

Caritas Internationalis, the international aid and development agency of the Catholic Church, said aid has already reached affected communities in Nepal in the form of emergency shelter, trauma counseling, food, clean water and hygiene materials.

Donations

Those who wish to donate may issue a cheque payable to “CBCP-Caritas Filipinas Foundation, Inc,” and have it sent to the following address:
