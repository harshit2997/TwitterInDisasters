Orphans Aid launches Nepal fundraiser

Food supplies are short, clean water at the best time times is hard to source and emergency aid is required urgently for the people of Nepal.

Orphans Aid chief executive officer Sue van Schreven, who has worked with the people of Nepal for over seven years, has launched a fundraiser to give some much needed relief.

On Saturday, while many of the Nepalese people were in church, a 7.8 magnitude earthquake struck, killing over 5000 people.

Van Schreven said emergency relief was a dire need.

"As the magnitude of the tragedy in Nepal unfolds our team in Northern India are receiving Nepali people who have fled their rural villages to find safety, food and water over the border. Urgent help is needed, both in Nepal and Northern India."

Fleeing Nepal was understandable, Van Schreven said.

"They want to get away from the shaking... The ongoing tremors must be terrible."

Van Schreven said the appeal would give immediate help, with funds being sent at the end of the week, as well as assisting with the organisation's long-term goal to help the country rebuild.

"One of our contacts runs a home for orphaned boys in Nepal. Currently they are all camped out on a field under the stars. This is just the kind of situation we want to help at this time. By working with locals on the ground, we can see real solutions brought to very large needs."

Cash donations can be made through any of Orphans Aid International's op-shops in Invercargill, Queenstown, Dunedin or Hastings, or online through Givealittle at givealittle.co.nz/cause/rebuildnepal2015. Donations could also be made through orphansaidinternational.org and facebook.com/Orphans.Aid.International.

Anyone wanting to help Nepal in the future could do so by buying Nepalese-made products that were sold in the stores, which would help the families of those who made them.

Last week a shipment of woollen socks, hats and slippers arrived from Nepal in Frankton, but another shipment, expected to arrive this week would not be coming.

Van Schreven said it would take a long time for Nepal to recover from the devastating earthquake and tourism, a key industry, was expected to dry up.

"It's going to have a huge effect on the local people," she said.

New Zealand builders had already been in contact with van Schreven about volunteering their skills.

"We've had quite a lot of builders approach us wanting to help."

"The rebuild is going to be absolutely massive."
