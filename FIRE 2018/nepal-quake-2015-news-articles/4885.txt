At least 300 St George residents made a huge effort on Sunday, May 3, to support Nepalese earthquake victims — spiritually and financially.



A buffet dinner at Coronation Hall at Arncliffe has raised $10,000 so far for the Nepal Earthquake Children’s Appeal after 160 people paid $60 a head.

Shaoquett Moselmane MLC and Rockdale Council organised the dinner.

Counting of more raffle tickets and pledges will see the $10,000 grow.

The candlelight vigil on Saturday night, May 2, in front of the Kogarah Library was about prayer and spirituality, and it inspired people to put their hands in their pockets.

Hurstville mayor Con Hindi said he would do his best to get the council to agree on a $10,000 donation; Rockdale mayor Shane O’Brien pledged $2500 and Kogarah mayor Michael Platt said the council would be happy to help out with fundraising activities.

Santosh Kumar, spokesman for St George Nepalese Club which organised the event, said the vigil could have been a washout but the 150 people who came, despite the rain, had made it a success.

A Hindu priest led the prayers and performed traditional mourning rites and the candle bearers organised themselves into a map of Nepal.

Mr Kumar said every dollar was a huge help as it could buy three meals in Nepal.

He said club members were collecting money at railway stations in two-to-three hour shifts.

Were you at either event?

From Rockdale Mayor Councillor Shane O'Brien: Rockdale has already contributed in excess of $2500.00 in resources to the fundraising initiatives. In addition I announced at the vigil on Saturday, and reiterated at the dinner organised by Council and Shaoquett Moselmane MLC last night, that I would be putting a mayoral minute to Council at our meeting this Wednesday requesting authorisation of a further donation of $10,000.00.
