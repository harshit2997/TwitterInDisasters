An Iowa man thought to be missing in Nepal has checked in on Facebook Monday morning.

Family and friends of the New Albin man had filed a missing person report with the U.S. Embassy in Kathmandu after losing contact with 30-year-old Cole Donahue.

Donahue's last known whereabouts were around Everest Base Camp the day before the magnitude-7.8 earthquake hit Nepal, triggering an avalanche on Mount Everest.

Cole Donahue's sister-in-law, Anna Donahue, told KCCI that Cole left for Kathmandu on April 15. She said the last check-in the family had with him was April 21 when he updated his Facebook.

Donahue checked in Monday morning with a message for family and friends, who were elated to hear from him.
