Police said the women were saved in the district of Sindupalchok, north-east of the capital Kathmandu. Two were buried under a mud house and a third was pulled from the earth after being swept away by a landslide. Meanwhile, a man aged 101 was miraculously pulled alive from the rubble of his home more than a week after the earthquake that devastated Nepal. The rescue came on Saturday – a day after the Nepalese government ruled out fi nding any more survivors. Funchu Tamang from Kintang, around 50 miles from Kathmandu, suffered only minor hand and leg injuries. Police offi cial Arun Kumar Singh said: “He was brought to the district hospital by helicopter. His condition is stable.” Eight Britons were airlifted from a monastery in a remote mountain area to Kathmandu where on Friday they boarded planes to the UK. Justine Greening, International Development Secretary, said they had been saved from “what could have been a life or death situation”.

Mountaineer Gareth Doulas, 37, from Bridgnorth in Shropshire, returned to the UK on Saturday. He had been preparing to climb Everest when the quake struck on April 25.



An RAF C-17 which had brought aid to Nepal rescued another seven Britons, bringing the number of people from the UK who were safely evacuated to 15 by yesterday.



But rescuers discovered 50 more bodies – including some foreign trekkers – on a popular walking route. A total of 57 foreigners have been killed, including 40 Indians, but 109 foreigners are still unaccounted for.



The offi cial nationwide death toll last night reached 7,250.



Nepal’s fi nance minister Ram Sharan Mahat said: “There are still villagers where we know that all houses have been destroyed, but have not yet been able to reach.



“The aftershocks have not receded and we expect the fi nal casualty numbers to climb much higher.” There is also heightened concern

about the spread of disease.



Nepalese Health Secretary Santa Shrestha said there had been reports of people being struck by diarrhoea in remote mountain villages but there is no epidemic yet.



Health teams had rushed to many of the affected areas.



With little safe drinking water or food, UN children’s agency Unicef also warned: “With the monsoon season only a few weeks away, children will be at particularly heightened risk of diseases like cholera.”
