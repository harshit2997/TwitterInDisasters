SPOKANE, Wash. â€“ Authorities said Monday more than 4,000 people have died following a massive earthquake that rattled Nepal Saturday.

Gonzaga University employee, Satish Shrestha is from Nepal and still has family in Kathmandu. His family is okay, but said it has been a traumatizing couple of days.

Shrestha went to Gonzaga for both his undergraduate and graduate degrees. He now works in the IT department.

He grew up in Kathmandu and came to the US in 2006. His parents and his brother still live there. Shrestha said that is what made the earthquake so traumatic for him.

Late Friday night, around 11:30 p.m. he started to see the news of the earthquake. He was able to text his brother right away. Shrestha said when he called him he could still hear shaking in the background.

Neither he nor his brother immediately knew if their parents were alive. It would not be until several hours later on Saturday morning that he would speak with them. His parent's home is fine. They slept outside for a few nights but have since returned indoors.

Shrestha said he has many friends in Kathmandu. One friend told him he saw a home collapsed right in front of him. Shrestha's aunt's home was destroyed as well. He said it is devastated knowing how many people have perished in the quake. He said it is also hard watching all of the footage of the damage because he said these are areas and landmarks he grew up around.

"It's very saddening that I'm getting to see all these previously such beautiful structure in shambles now," said Shrestha.

Shrestha said he does not have any immediate plans to return home. He said he is read that traveling home during all the chaos might not be helpful. He is instead focusing his efforts on directing people to donate to non-profits that will help. He said giving cash is the most effective.
