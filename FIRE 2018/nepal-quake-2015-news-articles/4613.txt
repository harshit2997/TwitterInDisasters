KATHMANDU: Endless political wrangling may make Nepal lose focus on its effort to handle post-quake problems.On Saturday, the number of deaths went beyond 7,100.Over the past few days, ministers and officials have issued statements that look like an attempt to answer questions raised by Opposition parties and a section of the media. On Friday, chief of army staff Gen Gaurav Shumsher JB Rana said there was no question of suspecting the role of Indian rescuers, who are always accompanied by Nepal army personnel.Opposition parties, especially Prachanda's Communist Party of Nepal (Unified Maoist), Communist Party of Nepal (Maoists) and Nepal Mazdoor Kisan Party have raised security concerns over the involvement of Indian Army in the relief work. A section of the media too devotes considerable space to sorties by Indian aircraft in northern Nepal with relief material.The frequent criticism of the government for its alleged shoddy handling of relief work has aroused passions among quake victims. On Friday, people heckled former PM Madhav Kumar Nepal of the Communist Party of Nepal (unified Marxist Leninist), a partner of the ruling alliance, at Sankhu, his constituency.The government will regulate flow of aid from agencies other than global and reputed ones. The Central Intelligence Bureau has warned people of possible internet frauds while carrying out fund collection drives. The opposition claims donors don't want to send money and material to the governnment, fearing misuse.Oblivious to political squabbling, personnel from Nepal and Indian armies and Nepal Police are focused on relief operations. At Basantapur Durbar Square in Kathmandu, Subedar Shajimon, with 35 personnel from the Indian Army's 21 Engineers, clears rubble from a lane near Kumari Ghar. "We've been doing this ever since we arrived here on April 28," said Shajimon.
