Summary: Nitish said it was not for the first third time that he was not permitted to visit Nepal. On the frequent traffic jams on Gandhi Setu, Nitish said he has instructed the road construction department principal secretary to get two pontoon bridges constructed on the eastern and western side of the bridge for movement of small vehicles. Describing the kidnapping of Gaya`s Dr Pankaj Gupta and his wife on Friday as a challenge for his government, Nitish said such crimes would not be tolerated at any cost.

PATNA: Chief minister Nitish Kumar on Tuesday took a dig at the ministry of external affairs (MEA) for not allowing him to visit Janakpur in Nepal. Soon after the issue was raised in the Rajya Sabha by JD (U) president Sharad Yadav, Nitish commented sarcastically, "I did not want to visit Janakpur for tourism but to see the damaged Janakpur temple and help people in the hours of crisis after the April 25 earthquake in Nepal." After a high-level meeting with top state officials to rid the Mahatma Gandhi Setu of perennial traffic snarls, Nitish said he wanted to walk the extra mile in helping the Nepal people.



"Farman aya ki abhi mat jayein toh ham nahin gaye (an order came that I should not go; so I did not). Initially, the government of India as well as the Nepal government OK`d my visit to Janakpur, but I do not understand what happened a day before the scheduled visit on Monday , As Reported By Times of India.



According to the Newspaper,MEA officials advised the Bihar chief secretary against my visit to the country," he said.



Nitish said it was not for the first third time that he was not permitted to visit Nepal. "When Kusaha dam was breached killing hundreds of people in the floods in Bihar, I wanted to visit Nepal on August 18, 2008. I was again denied permission when I was invited by the former Nepal PM Girija Prasad Koirala`s daughter to attend his last rites.



But I will do my best to help the quake-hit people of Nepal who have special bond with Bihar.
