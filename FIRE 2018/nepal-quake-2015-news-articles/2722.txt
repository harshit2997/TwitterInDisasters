WHO: Pharmas should give cash not drugs to aid Nepal earthquake relief efforts

The WHO is sending medical suppliers and healthcare workers to Nepal in response to the 7.8-manitude earthquake that struck the country on Saturday that left more than 4,500 people dead and caused widespread devastation.

According to reports 30 of Nepal’s 75 districts have been impacted and thousands of people are in need of health care for emergency needs and pre-conditions.



Injuries caused by this earthquake are similar to what we have seen after earthquakes of this magnitude: Many who were trapped in buildings as they collapsed have lost their lives.

The WHO said that: “Survivors have injuries ranging from broken bones, head trauma, spinal injuries and crush syndrome. These types of injuries require intensive and rapid medical treatment and some will require surgery​."



Aid effort​

A spokesman told in-Pharmatechnologist.com the organisation is due to fly 15 international emergency health kits (IEHK) – which include drugs, vaccines and surgical supplies - to Kathmandu from a logistics hub in Dubai later today.

He told us that all medicines are sourced from pre-qualified suppliers adding that the organisation “encourages [pharmaceutical industry donors] to provide cash rather than drugs, which sometimes do not meet WHO requirements​.”

According to the WHO a second shipment will be sent tomorrow, adding that it will include 25 IEHK kits, Interagency diarrhoeal disease kits (IDDK), trauma kits, surgical suppliers and tents and related support equipment.

The WHO has already provided $175,000 to the Nepalese Government from the South-East Asia Regional Health Emergency Fund.
