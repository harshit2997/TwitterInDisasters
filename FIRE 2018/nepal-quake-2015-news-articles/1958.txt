Colorado's Nepal earthquake connection: Colorado-born filmmaker killed on Mount Everest
</headline>

<text>
Nepal's worst earthquake in more than 80 years has so far claimed more than 4,000 lives. Stories of a Colorado connection surfaced soon after.

Here are a few from across the state:

-A man making a documentary about the Mount Everest base camp was among those killed when an avalanche hit Saturday, according to 9News Denver.

Tom Taplin, 61, was a Denver-born filmmaker, Seattle-based camp doctor and a Google engineer. His brother, Britton Taplin confirmed his death to 9NEWS on Sunday. Taplin was there with two other people working on a film about Everest climbers.

-Fort Collins mountaineers Jim Davidson and Alan Arnette were safely evacuated down to Mount Everest Base Camp Monday, after being stranded higher up the mountain following the devastating Nepal earthquake that caused a massive avalanche on the world's highest peak, according to the Coloradoan.

At least 17 people were killed and more than 60 injured when a wall of snow and ice shook loose from the mountain Saturday and smashed through Everest Base Camp — a staging area on the south side of the mountain for support teams and climbers trying to reach the top of the 29,035-foot mountain.

Davidson, who was attempting to climb Everest for the first time, was at Camp 1 above Base Camp when the avalanche struck. Arnette, who was climbing nearby Lhotse, which uses part of the same route up Everest, was at Camp 2.

-A Durango man with Nepal connections told the Durange Herald that his village is gone.

Ram Thapa, chef at the Himalayan Kitchen in Durango, he said he is saddened, thinking of Nepal, not just his village near Kathmandu. “All homes,” he said. “No homes left. My mother, my brothers, my family are all outside sleeping. No homes.” Read more about Thapa here.

-A Nepalese band took the stage Sunday for a planned concert in Boulder despite hearing the news that thousands of their countrymen had been killed by a natural disaster.



Band members told KCNC-TV that they arrived in the U.S. days before the earthquake and are eager to get home.
