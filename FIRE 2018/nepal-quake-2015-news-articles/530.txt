Google executive Dan Fredinburg was among the dead on Mount Everest after a 7.8 magnitude earthquake struck Nepal.

A woman identifying herself as Fredinburg's sister posted from his Instagram account on Saturday, saying that he had suffered a "major head injury" and died.

"We appreciate all of the love that has been sent our way thus far and know his soul and his spirit will live on in so many of us," according to the post on Instagram.

"All our love and thanks to those who shared this life with our favourite, hilarious, strong-willed man. He was and is everything to us."

The massive earthquake triggered an avalanche on the mountain, which slammed into a section of the mountaineering base camp. At least 10 climbers and guides have been killed, and an unknown number of people are injured and missing. The quake, which originated outside the capital Kathmandu, has killed more than 1,180 people.

Two other members of Fredinburg's mountaineering team suffered non-life threatening injuries in the avalanche. They are being treated at Everest Base Camp.

Earlier on Saturday, Google issued a notice on its Person Finder project that Fredinburg was missing.

Fredinburg, a software engineer by trade, was a 2004 graduate of the University of California, Irvine.

He had worked for Google since 2007, and was head of privacy for Google X, the company's highly secretive research lab in California.

Fredinburg had a role in several prominent Google projects, including Project Loon, which is developing a global network of high-altitude balloons to provide internet access to people in remote areas, and Project Wing, a drone-based delivery program.

He was also part of Google's Adventure Team, which was charged with bringing back imagery from remote regions across the globe such as Aconcagua, New Guinea, Kilimanjaro and Mount Elbrus.

Fredinburg had dated actress Sophia Bush until they broke up last year. Bush paid tribute to Fredinburg on Instagram Saturday:
