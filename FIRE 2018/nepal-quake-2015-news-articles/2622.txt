In brief: EWU fraternity investigated over complaints of misconduct
</headline>

<text>
The Eastern Washington University chapter of Sigma Phi Epsilon fraternity is under investigation for allegations of unspecified misconduct.

It’s being conducted by the fraternity’s national headquarters, which sent a representative to Cheney after receiving complaints about the local chapter. The university is assisting and could open its own investigation as more information becomes available, EWU spokesman Dave Meany said.

The university has been told only that reports of inappropriate behavior have been received and that none have drawn the attention of either the campus or the Cheney police departments, Meany said.

Rumors that the fraternity is on the verge of being shut down have swirled for days, fueled in part by sexually lurid social media postings and a photo of what appears to be a drunken student passed out on the floor.

“We expect all of our students to behave according to both their university’s policies and ours, and we work with our university partners to remove students or chapters that pose a risk to student safety,” Sigma Phi Epsilon national CEO Brian Warren said in a statement.

Partners International raising money for Nepal quake relief

Partners International of Spokane is raising money to send to Nepal.

The Christian-based organization sent $10,000 on Monday but is raising additional disaster relief money for people displaced by the earthquakes and longer-term rebuilding efforts. Partners International helps support two indigenous Christian outreach programs in Nepal that provide vocational training for women and meals and schooling for children. Partners International has been involved in ministries to Nepal for 12 years.

“We don’t know what all the needs will be,” said Scott Steinloski, director of marketing and communications. “We’re waiting to hear from our ministry partners.”
