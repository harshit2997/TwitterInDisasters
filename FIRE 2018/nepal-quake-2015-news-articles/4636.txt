Members of the Nepalese community are gathering in East Texas for a vigil for the victims of last week's earthquake.

Many have family members that will go to sleep in tents in the streets of their home country.

Mamta Dhakal says contacting family members in Kathmandu was nearly impossible immediately following the 7.8 magnitude earthquake.

"It's nerve racking, I was like emotionally drained," Mamta Dhakal said.

Several pain-staking hours later, she was able to speak with her parents. Their family home suffered structural damage, leaving many of her relatives sleeping in tents.

"Back and forth in the mud, it was raining therefore they were affected very, very much," said Naryan Dhakal.

Its been nearly 10 years since Mamta and her husband have been back to Nepal, so they were determined to do all they could to help here in East Texas.

"We just want everyone to be here and pray and support for this cause," Dhakal said.

They started planning a candlelight vigil and prayer service to remember the lives lost and to pray for the injured and displaced. Mamta says the Red Cross immediately stepped in to offer their services.

"They have been there from the moment they've heard. They've called, texted, how can we help what can we do," Dhakal said.

Arun Chapagain visited his home country just two months ago.

"The situation was very nice and everyone, the Nepalese people were so happy,‚Äù Chapagain said.

He says he's still trying to wrap his head around the devastation.

"Our heritage is collapsed, many houses are collapsed, many people have died, it's a huge natural disaster," Chapagain said.

He's hoping to find healing in the supportive arms of his community here in Tyler.

"We all are praying for Nepal," Chapagain said.

The candlelight vigil will be at Southside Park in Tyler from 7:00 p.m. to 9:00 p.m.

The Red Cross will be taking donations for relief efforts.
