Only eleven Israelis are left unaccounted for in Nepal, a source belonging to Foreign Ministry reported Tuesday.



Initial figures provided by the Foreign Ministry in the first reports since a 7.9 earthquake struck Nepal on Saturday indicated that as many as 250 Israelis were missing, setting off fears of serious injuries and even fatalities.



According to Israel radio however, there have been no reports of Israeli fatalities as a result of the earthquake and subsequent avalanches.



Separately, on Tuesday members of Israel's emergency response teams in Nepal had rescued 10 Israelis who were trapped in a monastery near Kathamndu. The group of 10, all of whom were deemed healthy, were evacuated in Jeeps and taken to the capital's Chabad house.
