New Delhi: The toll due to the April 25 earthquake in India has gone up to 78, while the number of injured people stands at 560, the government said on Wednesday.

“As per latest reports, 78 deaths have been reported so far in India – 58 in Bihar, 16 in Uttar Pradesh, 3 in West Bengal and 1 in Rajasthan.

“A total of 560 people – 275 in Bihar, 100 in Uttar Pradesh, 169 in West Bengal, 9 in Sikkim and 7 in Rajasthan – have been reported injured,” said a release issued here.

The central government on Wednesday reviewed its rescue and relief operations both in Nepal and India.

Indian assistance to quake-devastated Nepal has been appreciated. Indian rescue agencies have saved many foreign nationals trapped in Kathmandu and other areas of Nepal.

Meanwhile, India said it is focusing on Nepal’s capital Kathmandu and the worst-affected Gorkha district for its rescue and relief efforts in the quake-hit country.

“India has focused its assistance in two parts of Nepal. The first one is the capital-Kathmandu and the second one is Gorkha district which was epicentre of the earthquake,” Indian ambassador to Nepal Ranjit Rae said. Rae accompanied by Deputy Prime Minister of Nepal Bam Dev Gautam visited the site of a collapsed six storey residential building in Kathmandu district. With the help of National Disaster Response Force (NDRF), rescue work was carried out and ten bodies were recovered from the building.

30 NDRF personnel from India were part of this operation. Over 500 personnel from NDRF are currently in Nepal to carry out the rescue operations.

“We are fully committed to help government of Nepal in this gigantic disaster. We express our solidarity with the people in this tragic moment and will continue our cooperation towards the government of Nepal as long as it is required,” Rae said. India has also made arrangement for evacuation of Indian citizens from Kathmandu to return to their homes and most of them have been sent back via land route.

Buses from UP and Bihar have come to take the people back, while injured have been air-lifted back to India. (Agencies)
