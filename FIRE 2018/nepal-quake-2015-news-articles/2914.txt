SWALLOWS come home mum, swallows always come home.

Those words were on repeat in Christine Davson-Galle's mind as she kept up hope her daughter would be found alive in Nepal.

On Tuesday night the words came true when the Launceston teacher learnt her daughter was safe and well.

Jenny Davson-Galle had not been heard from since the 7.8 magnitude earthquake pounded Kathmandu on Saturday.

"She should have been in Kathmandu, her base has been in Kathmandu, but she wasn't in Kathmandu," Ms Davson-Galle told The Examiner yesterday.

Instead the 29-year-old, on her seventh trip to Nepal, was "stuck on a mountain somewhere" just as her mother had hoped.

On Tuesday, Ms Davson-Galle spoke to a Nepalese trekking company, which confirmed Jenny had been on a trek near Mount Kangchenjunga, east of Kathmandu, when the earthquake hit.

Ms Davson-Galle was surrounded by Jenny's Bhutanese friends in Launceston at the time.

"It was big hugs all around," she said.

"Jenny is really precious to me - I can't make another Jenny."

Since then the family has managed a 20-second phone call with Jenny.

Just before her trip Jenny had a swallow tattooed on her leg. For her mother it reinforced something Jenny often told her - "swallows always come home mum".

Jenny has been in Nepal since January volunteering in the Pathri Bhutanese refugee camp.

Tough times await the former Hobart Red Cross worker as she makes her way to the decimated capital, her mother believes.

"What she is going to see is not going to be a very nice nice thing and it's going to be hard," she said.

"The people are her interest, that's why she went there."

Jenny is among a dozen or so Tasmanians thought to be in Nepal.

Plans are under way to airlift Launceston's Julien Tempone-Wiltshire from a village in northern Nepal.

Launceston business owner Reuben Brimfield is with a trekking group, which has called off its trip and is making its way back to Pokhara in eastern Nepal.
