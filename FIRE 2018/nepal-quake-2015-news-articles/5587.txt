Some northern villages of the worst affected Sindhupalchok district are yet to receive relief materials even 12 days after the Great Earthquake.

The authorities concerned have failed to deliver relief materials to five settlements of Golche and Gumba VDCs in northern part of Sindhupalchok as suspension bridges linking the area were snapped due to the earthquake.

Chinlal Tamang, a local of Gumba, told the Post over telephone that 120 households at Tembathan, Tega and Nimatol in Gumba VDC are still deprived of relief as the suspension bridge across the Nesam stream snapped during the quake.

“A helicopter had dropped some foodstuffs three days ago. But that was not enough for thousands of earthquake victims in the area who have been rendered homeless and without anything to eat,” he said.

Similarly, earthquake victims at Lidi and Sangdung settlements in Golche VDC have still not been provided with relief materials till now.

The villages are cut off as narrow foot trails have been blocked by the landslides triggered by the earthquake.

Likewise, a helicopter dropped drinking water at Baruwa in the district on Wednesday. There was also acute shortage of drinking water in Baruwa after the devastating quake.

Meanwhile, the District Development Committee has allocated budget to all the VDCs to purchase relief materials. Each VDC has been provided with Rs 900,000 for disaster relief management.
