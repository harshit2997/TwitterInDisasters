A SOUL-searching sabbatical for former Chaffey Senior College teacher Luke Jedd left him stranded amid the Nepalese earthquake.



This was Mr Jedd’s second volunteer trip to the region visiting an orphanage 20 minutes outside Kathmandu.

The young teacher was taking some time in Asia contemplating his next career move.

Although he had a passion for teaching, the film graduate is currently planning to workshop a musical he has written.

After a short trip to Nagarkot when he was finished work in the orphanage, Mr Jedd returned to Kathmandu. He was ordering lunch when the 7.8-magnitude earthquake struck.

“Someone had said to me recently that every 80 years a big quake happens and for some reason I didn’t panic when it started,” he said.

“I just wanted to get to the nearest open space and I began following the staff out of the restaurant.”

Over the next 24 hours, as significant aftershocks continued to hit the devastated region, Mr Jedd visited the orphanage he had been working at to check on everyone’s safety.

Luckily, the orphanage was located in an open area and everyone was safe.

“I stayed in the orphanage overnight and it was very hard to find conclusive information on what was happening. There was one radio available and one person had internet on their phone.”
