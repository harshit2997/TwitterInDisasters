Six more IL-76 transport planes are ready to help earthquake relief in Nepal, a spokesperson of Chinese air force said late on Tuesday.[Special coverage]

The planes will make 13 trips from the Chinese city of Chengdu to Kathmandu from Tuesday night, transporting relief supplies including tents and generators, Colonel Shen Jinke said.

The air force has already sent eight IL-76 transport aircraft on 20 trips from April 27 to May 4 to deliver rescue teams and supplies.

Staff on the mission are experienced, especially in overseas military operations, Shen said.

The IL-76 transport aircraft is a multi-purpose four-engine aircraft widely used in Europe, Asia and Africa.
