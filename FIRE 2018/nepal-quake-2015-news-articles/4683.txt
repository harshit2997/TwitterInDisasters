Aldershots Buddhist Community Centre are looking for volunteers to help victims of the Nepal Earthquake.

After an overwhelming response of donations from local people, the organisation now needs assistance to pack 'survival boxes'.

Led by Dr Kapil Rijal, a team of 21 doctors, nurses and volunteers will be visiting the remote villages of Nepal.

They will be providing necessary medical care, plus food and shelter. The first batch of 500 survival boxes are ready for despatch.

The boxes will contain blankets, Chura (beaten rice), savoury foods, 2 packets of biscuits, lentils, rice and a few useful utensils.

They are also looking for local removal and shipping companies to donate crates to send the items in.

If you think you can help then visit The Bhuddist Community Centres website.
