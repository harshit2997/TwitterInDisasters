Feds pledge more relief for Nepal, defend assistance for Canadians

Canada is sending more relief supplies to earthquake-struck Nepal and promising to match donations to a fund specifically set up to help.

But the federal government is also defending itself from claims that affected Canadians aren’t getting the assistance they need.

Emilie-Anne Leroux has been trying to get home to Montreal but says Ottawa isn’t doing enough to help expats and travellers stranded in the stricken country.

Leroux says while other countries have pulled out all the stops to get their citizens home, she and others from Canada haven’t received so much as a phone call from Canadian officials.

Foreign Affairs Minister Rob Nicholson says consular staff members from India are doing everything they can to get into Kathmandu, but have so far been unsuccessful.

The federal government also announced today it will match — dollar-for-dollar — all eligible contributions to the Nepal Earthquake Relief Fund until May 25th.

The government is also deploying relief supplies from emergency stockpiles in Ontario and Dubai to help meet immediate needs.

More than 40 Canadian Armed Forces personnel are aboard a CF17 Globemaster aircraft that’s already been deployed to Nepal.

They include 18 assessment team members from the Disaster Assistance Response Team, or DART, seven urban search and rescue team members, six medical personnel and one member of the Canadian Red Cross.

They are expected to arrive in Nepal by early Wednesday morning, although that timeline is in question because of earthquake damage at the airport in the capital city.
