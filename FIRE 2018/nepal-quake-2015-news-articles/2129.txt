The New Zealand trekker who died in the Mt Everest region of Nepal following the country's devastating earthquake was Greg Kay, a son of the former Mayor of Auckland the late Colin Kay.

Greg Kay died in his sleep of a heart attack on Sunday, at a hotel in the village of Tengboche where his trekking group stayed overnight. His family said he had not been diagnosed with a heart disorder.

A Remuera resident, aged 61, Mr Kay had wide business interests. He was a former chief executive of state-owned Coalcorp (later called Solid Energy), and of the agricultural services company Wrightson. He had been closely associated with the privatisation and stock exchange listing of Telecom.

He was on a trekking trip led by Peter Hillary, son of the late Sir Edmund Hillary. All 12 in the group had attended Kings College at the same time and they were raising money for a new water system at the village of Lukla, where Sir Edmund built the airstrip that is the aviation hub for access to the Everest region.

The trekking group had intended to visit the Everest base camp in the Khumbu Glacier, but turned back after the earthquake in Nepal at around midday on Saturday, which that has killed more than 4000 people.

The quake triggered a massive avalanche that swept through the base camp, killing at least 18 people and injuring more than 60.

At the time of the avalanche, the Hillary group was between the tiny village of Gorak Shep, which is about 4km down valley from the base camp, and the base camp itself. They returned to the Gorak Shep, and on Sunday proceeded down to Tengboche.

Mr Kay's brother, Geoff, told nzherald.co.nz today on behalf of the family: "We are devastated at this sudden loss of a much loved member of our family. Greg was a unique, kind and generous man who will be greatly missed.

"At this very difficult time, the family asks for privacy and time to grieve."

Greg Kay is survived by his wife, Sudy, two adult sons and one granddaughter, and both of the son's wives are expecting babies, which, Geoff Kay said, "is a great sadness for us that Greg won't see them".

Geoff Kay said the family was working with authorities in Nepal to make arrangements for the return of his brother's body to New Zealand.
