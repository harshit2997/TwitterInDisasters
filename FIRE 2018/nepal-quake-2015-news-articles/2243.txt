CHANDIGARH: Sikh bodies are pitching with help for earthquake victims in Nepal, with the Shiromani Gurdwara Parbandhak Committee (SGPC) and the Delhi Sikh Gurdwara Management Committee (DSGMC) arranging to send food packets on Monday, and set-up langar (community kitchens) in Kathmandu.

Speaking to Express, DSGMC president Manjit Singh said 25,000 food packets would be sent every day to Nepal. “We will send food packets as long as they are needed. Besides, a four-member team led by Omkar Singh Thappar is going to Kathmandu to assess what is needed by the people there besides food, like clothes, blankets, etc, and it will be sent accordingly.”

“We are also sending ten tonnes of raw-materials — food items like dal, atta, vegetables, ghee, spices, along with gas cylinders, stoves and other cooking material and 20 cooks who will set up langar in Kathmandu and cook and serve people there,” said Singh.

He said that the food packets, which will be airlifted by the IAF from Delhi, will be prepared at Gurdwara Bangla Sahib. “We are also getting many phone calls from devotees saying they are ready to provide whatever was needed for the victims,” he said.

Each food packet would contain four chapatis, dry vegetable cooked in ghee and pickle wrapped in silver foil. He said the SAD would also coordinate with the Nepalese Government to find out if there were any other requirements.

He said the demand for dry ration, including milk powder and biscuits, clothes or tents, would also be sent soon.
