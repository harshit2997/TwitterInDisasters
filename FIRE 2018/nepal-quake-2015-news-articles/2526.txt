KATHMANDU, Nepal -- Three of the six Colorado mountaineers who were climbing Mount Everest when a 7.8-magnitude earthquake struck Nepal on Saturday have been safely airlifted from Camp 1 to base camp.

Alan Arnette of Fort Collins has joined Jim Davidson of Fort Collins, Boulder High School student Matt Moniz, Charley Mace, Jim Walkley and Jon Kedrowski of Vail in base camp.

The group is expected to remain in base camp for a few days.

Kedrowski spoke with meteorologist Chris Tomer from base camp on Monday and talked about what he is seeing in the aftermath of the earthquake.

His voice sounded strong and he said he is helping Arnette and Davidson after they were airlifted.

A Colorado native was not so lucky. Tom Taplin, a documentary filmmaker from Evergreen and Santa Monica, Calif., died in an avalanche that was triggered by the earthquake, his wife Cory Freyer said.

Taplin, who was born in Denver, was working on a documentary on Everest when the quake and avalanche struck.
