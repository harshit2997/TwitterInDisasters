India going all out to help quake-hit Nepal

The Indian government is pulling all stops to support its strategically important neighbour as Nepal grapples with the scale of Saturday's earthquake.

NEW DELHI: India has deployed over two dozen aircraft, including helicopters, and nearly 1,000 trained personnel to assist quake-hit Nepal as part of Operation Maitri, which translates as friendship.

On Monday (Apr 27) the Indian Air Force (IAF) faced hurdles getting aircraft, including a C-130 transport plane carrying tonnes of food, medical and relief supplies, into earthquake-hit Nepal. Rains and aftershocks have slowed operations in the Himalayan country as the death toll passed 3,500 from the devastating weekend earthquake.

"Kathmandu is at very high altitude and we have got hills all around the place,” said Rajesh, Wing Commander, IAF. “Weather was quite bad and not safe for conducting operations, so we had to divert. We will be making a fresh attempt and hopefully the weather should be with us.”

Indian military forces have also stepped up efforts to evacuate Indians stranded outside of the capital Kathmandu. Earlier the IAF evacuated 1900 people, including some foreign tourists, back to India.

“My children were playing outside when the earthquake happened,” said Sonia, an evacuated Indian national. “The moment the earthquake struck I ran down to save my children; I sprained my leg but I saved them first."

As part of Operation Maitri, the Indian foreign ministry has set up helplines and announced compensation for Indian families who have lost relatives in the disaster. In addition to rescue forces, the government will send a team from various ministries to co-ordinate its relief efforts. Other personnel of India's National Disaster Response Force such as civilian doctors are also poised to join the effort.
