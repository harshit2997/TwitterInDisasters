Gov. Rick Scott honors Altamonte Springs Marine killed in Nepal
</headline>

<text>
Gov. Rick Scott will be honoring the Central Florida Marine who died last week during a rescue mission in Nepal.

Sgt. Ward Mark Johnson, 29, is one of six U.S. Marines and two Nepalese soldiers aboard the U.S. Marine helicopter that disappeared during the mission. The Marines were delivering food supplies to an area that was particularly devastated after two major earthquakes.

"The U.S. Marines that lost their lives represent one of the truest forms of the American spirit – a willingness to serve others to make our world a better place to live,” the governor said.

Ward’s parents still live in Altamonte Springs.

Gov. Scott is honoring Ward’s memory by ordering the lowering of flags in the coming days.<
