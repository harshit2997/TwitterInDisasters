Filmmaker Anubhav Sinha is making frantic appeals on a social networking platform to help him evacuate his house help from the Rasuwa district of earthquake-hit Nepal.

The "Ra.One" director took to micro-blogging site Twitter to call for help and requested the Twitterati to retweet the message to reach more people.

"Can Someone in Kathmandu help me reach out to a rescue team in Rasuwa Area. I need Ram rescued +9779741186914 Badly wounded. Please RT," he shared.

Sinha had shared the details about his help on the micro-blogging site on Sunday.
