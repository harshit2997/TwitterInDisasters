Pine Valley Elementary School is raising money to help with disaster relief in Nepal where two earthquakes have devastated the Asian country.

Mrs. Ladd's second grade class and Ms. Crowley's fourth grade class have organized a coin drive for students and parents to donate loose change to.

Earlier this year, the students had a 24-hour Skype-A-Thon where they were able to video chat with other children around the globe. Nepal was one country they met through the Skype-A-Thon.

The classroom the Wilmington students talked with were some of those affected by the Nepal earthquakes. According to teachers at Pine Valley, the Nepal students are safe, but their villages were affected by the quakes.

The Nepal school is currently being used as a shelter for earthquake victims. When Pine Valley students found out about this disaster they were ready to find a way to help their new friends.

"There has been such an outpouring of compassion from the community and students at Pine Valley," said second-grade teacher Beverly Ladd, "especially students that participated in the 24-hour Skype-A-Thon. Having that experience has spread our learning community to classrooms all over the world instead of just my four walls."

"Even though we are 8,000 miles apart, students are still connected learners concerned about their 'friends' in Nepal and frequently ask for any updates or news from them. We have been leaving positive and uplifting video Skype messages for them weekly."

The coin drive is called #Nickels4Nepal. Culligan Water in Wilmington has donated empty water jugs that now sit in each Pine Valley classroom across all grades.

Children are being encouraged to donate their coins throughout the month of May. All of the donations will be sent directly to those affected in Nepal.

Friday, May 15 will be coined #FillitFriday. Students and parents will volunteer to walk car to car during morning drop off and after pick up.

Mrs. Ladd said the school's goal was the raise $1,000 by the end of may. As of Friday, May 15, they have collected more than $1,800.
