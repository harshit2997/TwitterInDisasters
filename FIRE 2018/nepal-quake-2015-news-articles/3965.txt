Charmaine Wilson, on Nepal missing list, contacts family

Kapiti regional councillor Nigel Wilson is hugely relieved to discover his sister, reported missing after the quake in Kathmandu, is safe and returning home.

Charmaine Wilson, 56, was in Kathmandu doing aid work when the quake struck and was on the official Red Cross missing persons list for two days.

Wilson said he found out from a message placed on Facebook by his niece that she was safe and returning to her home in Brisbane.

"She loves India, goes there all the time. Nobody had a clue how she was, we just thought 'Oh my God, what has happened?'

"When you do not hear any word except there are thousands dying, it is an awful feeling. It took her a couple of days to notify anyone. Telecommunications is a big issue.

"I tried ringing her number straight away after the earthquake but someone answered who did not speak English. I texted the same number but got a message back saying it could not be delivered.

"But she managed to contact her daughter and I found out from Facebook she was OK. I am really relieved.

"I really feel for the families who have not heard yet. It is an incredibly difficult thing to go through."
