Kiwi engineers headed to Nepal

Earthquake-devastated Nepal has now asked for New Zealand help and four engineers with expertise in strengthening buildings are on their way to Kathmandu, the Government says.

The Nepalese government had asked for experts to help with damage assessments of critical public infrastructure, including government buildings and hospitals, Foreign Minister Murray McCully said today.

"Four New Zealand engineers, with considerable experience in earthquake strengthening, have volunteered their time and they are en route to Nepal."

They will spend a week in Kathmandu where they will assess damage and decide whether more engineers, up to a dozen, are needed, Mr McCully said.

"This later deployment would be for three months and would focus on assisting with stabilisation and retrofitting of damaged buildings."

Nepal's April 25 earthquake killed more than 8000 people and left thousands more homeless and in desperate need of food, clean water and shelter.

New Zealand's initial offer of an urban search and rescue teams was declined.

However, following the devastating 2010 and 2011 Canterbury earthquakes New Zealand has developed considerable expertise in quake-strengthening buildings.

To date New Zealand has provided $2 million in financial assistance to Nepal, which has gone to the New Zealand Red Cross operating there and the Himalayan Trust.
