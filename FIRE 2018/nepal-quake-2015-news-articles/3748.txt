Nepal govt. cops flak over slow aid delivery
</headline>

<text>
Updated 1.11pm: Military teams are flying from Kathmandu to outlying areas of Nepal every 30 minutes.

But there's still not enough aid getting through.

Many of the villages are extremely hard to access and falling rocks have blocked what roads there are - a helicopter is the only way to deliver help.

Sky's David Bowden says the government has been criticised for the slow speed in which aid is getting through.

"For the vast majority of Nepal, the extent of the rescue effort is DIY digging. Locals with few tools scrambling around in the rubble, trying to retrieve who and what they can from the debris."

An MP's admitted the government's response has been too slow and too limited.

David Bowden says shelter, food, water and medical care is desperately needed.

"The tons of aid arriving in Nepal are only slowly getting through to those who need it most. In the remote areas away from the capital, the situation is dire."

Save the Children says 136 tonnes of aid is due to land in Nepal over the next few days.

That will include jerry cans, buckets, plastic sheeting, soap and medical equipment.

Thousands of blankets and tarpaulins are also being transported by road from India.

Nearly five thousand schools are believed to have been completely destroyed by Nepal's deadly earthquake.

Save the Children says in Gorkha only, just 10% of the district's 500 schools have escaped damage.

The destruction will impact 75,000 school children.

Save the Children says schools must be rebuilt and repaired, so children aren't deprived of their basic right to education and can regain some sense of normality.

Habitat for Humanity's Grahame Roberts is over there.

He says the widespread devastation is beyond comprehension.

"I have not had the opportunity to explore very widely, from the main part of Kathmandu, and one part of me doesn't really want to see it. It's emotional enough what you do see, it's a pretty frightening story really."
