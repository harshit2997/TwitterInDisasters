The Australian Government will provide additional support to help the people of Nepal recover from the devastating earthquake. Our thoughts continue to be with the millions of people affected by this tragic event.



Funding of an additional $10 million will provide critical assistance to help people rebuild their lives. It will support:

women and vulnerable communities to establish small businesses and generate income;

vulnerable children to go back to school, with a focus on girls and children with disability; and

rebuilding better and safer education infrastructure with advice from Australian engineering experts.

The Australian Government is currently in discussions with the Nepal Government and trusted international and Australian organisations on implementing this package. Our support will also help the people of Nepal to have a greater role in the reconstruction of their communities.

Today’s announcement brings Australia’s contribution to the Nepal earthquake to more than $20 million. We have provided:

$10 million in humanitarian assistance to be delivered by Australian non-government organisations, UN partners, the International Federation of the Red Cross and the Australian Red Cross;

$50,000 for maternal and child health and protection for women and girls;

Two C17 flights carrying 936 tarpaulins, 1,200 blankets, 746 hygiene kits and 80,000 water purification tablets; and

DFAT humanitarian personnel and a medical team to assist with coordination and assessments.

The Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade fielded over 2400 calls, confirmed the safety of 1525 Australians and permanent residents in Nepal, and provided consular assistance to hundreds of Australians. The Australian Government assisted 106 people to depart Nepal by Australia Defence Force aircraft. Additional consular and humanitarian officials remain in Nepal to assist in Australia’s response to the crisis. We are continuing to provide consular support to Australians who were in Nepal at the time.
