EARTHQUAKE IN NEPAL
</headline>

<text>
The Australian Embassy in Nepal is providing assistance to Australians and has confirmed the safety of over 200.

There are 549 Australians registered as travelling in Nepal and officials are working under challenging conditions to locate all those in the country.

While there are reports of extensive loss of life, at this point there are no reports of Australian deaths.

DFAT has opened its Emergency Call Unit and has updated the travel advice for Nepal. It notes disruptions to telecommunications, transport and tourist infrastructure, and advises Australians to follow the instructions of local authorities.

I urge Australians concerned for the welfare of family and friends in Nepal to attempt to contact them directly.

If unable to do so, they should call the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade’s 24-hour Consular Emergency Centre on (02) 6261-3305 or, within Australia, on 1300 555 135 (local call cost).

The Australian Government will also provide an immediate package of life-saving humanitarian support to Nepal as it responds to the devastation caused by the magnitude 7.9 earthquake of 25 April.

An Australian Crisis Response Team will travel to Nepal as soon as possible to assist in establishing the welfare of Australians unaccounted for after the earthquake on 25 April. Two humanitarian experts will also be deployed.

The Australian Embassy in Kathmandu is working closely with Nepalese authorities and other donors to assess the full extent of the disaster. Australia’s $5 million assistance will include:

. $2.5 million to assist Australian non-government organisations;

. $2 million to support United Nations partners; and

. $0.5 million to support the Australian Red Cross.
