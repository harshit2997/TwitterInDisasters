CHARIKOT, Nepal — Nepal has been overwhelmed by its second powerful earthquake in less than three weeks, its prime minister said Thursday as he visited this usually placid foothills town, now filling up with frightened villagers desperate for government help.

Thousands of people coming from surrounding areas to seek help crowd the streets of Charikot, the administrative center of the isolated district hit hardest by the magnitude-7.3 quake Tuesday, which killed at least 110 people and injured more than 2,300. The magnitude-7.8 earthquake that hit April 25 killed more than 8,150 people, injured tens of thousands more and left hundreds of thousands homeless.

“After the first quake, we were not prepared for a second one so big,” Prime Minister Sushil Koirala told reporters after arriving in Charikot by helicopter.

A search continued for a Marine helicopter carrying six Marines and two Nepalese soldiers that disappeared Tuesday while delivering aid.

The search for the helicopter was focused around Sunkhani, 50 miles northeast of the capital.

The quake Tuesday was less powerful than the one in April and shook a smaller, less populated area. It was centered between Kathmandu and Mt. Everest. It hit hardest in deeply rural parts of the Himalayan foothills, hammering many villages reached only by hiking trails and causing road-blocking landslides.
