Pankaj Satardekar, a tour guide who went missing while accompanying tourists to Nepal when the quake struck on Saturday, was located on Sunday after family members took to Twitter, and directly connected with CM Devendra Fadnavis."He is safe in Pokhara. For details you may contact our officer Mr Samir Sahai," Fadnavis tweeted later.Vikenanand Gupta, a city-based lawyer who tagged Fadnavis, foreign minister Sushma Swaraj, Union minister Rajiv Pratap Rudy and the PMO in his tweet, admitted that he had not anticipated such quick response."Pankaj is due to get married soon and his in-laws were worried. As there was absolutely no contact with him or anyone else in Nepal, I decided to tweet on their behalf. And it worked," Gupta said.Pankaj, who works with Kesari Tours and Travels, had travelled several times to Nepal. This time, he was leading a large group of tourists on an eight-day trip to Kathmandu and Chitwan National Park. The group had left on Friday. A statement issued by Kesari Tours and Travels said, "Kesari extends its heartfelt sympathies to Nepal. The Nepal On Tour Group is safe in Kathmandu and has been shifted to open ground. They are being diverted back to Mumbai."Samir Sahay, Additional Resident Commissioner of Maharashtrra Sadan in New Delhi), said, "The CM has circulated my number on Twitter. I have been continuously getting calls from many family members. We are gathering information from callers and sharing it with the Ministry of External Affairs. MEA officers are coordinating on ground in Nepal and reverting with details to us, which I share with the callers. Till 8 pm on Sunday, 100 people from Maharashtra have reached Delhi safely."Sahai added that rescue operations was still going on. "We have not received a single complaint yet where relatives are not traceable or missing. Those who wish to stay back and rest in Delhi are going to the Maharashtra Sadan, where suitable arrangements have been made. Those who wish to return home are being helped with bookings. We appeal to them to not panic, and I can be called at any time," he said.
