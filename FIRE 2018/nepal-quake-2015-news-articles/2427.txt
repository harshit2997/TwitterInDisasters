“Heal me, O Lord, and I shall be healed; save me, and I shall be saved, for you are my praise.” (Jeremiah 17:14)

A special Magen David Adom (MDA) humanitarian mission departed from Israel on Sunday to Nepal to assist in emergency efforts following a devastating earthquake that has left several thousand dead and injured.

Israel’s national emergency medical, disaster, ambulance and blood bank service, MDA said in a statement that following consultations between MDA Director General Eli Bin and Israeli officials, “it was decided to launch an MDA humanitarian mission consisting of paramedics and doctors to Nepal.”

“Our mission is to arrive quickly to the Chabad center in Kathmandu and to provide medical attention to the Israeli victims who may require it in the area. We are prepared and ready to contribute from our knowledge and experience in order to treat and assist the victims of this tragedy in Nepal,” Bin said in a statement.

The MDA mission is partnering with the Red Cross disaster response team and has initiated special emergency protocols in preparation for “prolonged activity in disaster stricken zones.”

MDA doctors and paramedics will work alongside the IDF emergency response team already in place in Nepal, as well as Red Cross movement.

According to MDA, the relief mission left Israel in a specially chartered plane directly to Kathmandu. The plane is especially outfitted with “medical supplies, medicine, baby formula in order to reach the babies currently held up in the local Chabad center”.

Once on the ground, the MDA team hopes to quickly “establish a forward emergency response and treatment post for initial treatment in Nepal.”
