"As for Ukrainians in Nepal: as of today, we have 177 people on the list, of whom 77 have not been in contact after the earthquake. According to some reports, a Polish plane evacuated five of our citizens," Perebiynis said.

As UNIAN reported earlier, the official death toll from the Nepal quake has exceeded 4,300 people, while 8,000 people were injured.

According to the Ukrainian Foreign Ministry, an aircraft from Ukraine’s Defense Ministry will fly to Nepal in the near future to evacuate Ukrainian citizens.
