Providing aid to quake-hit Nepal is a social and moral duty of the West Bengal government, Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee said on Monday.

She visited the Nepal border at Panitanki in Darjeeling district to hand over relief materials to the Nepalese authorities.

“Nepal is always a friendly country to us and being a neighbouring State we thought that it is our social obligation and moral duty to help the people of Nepal,” Ms. Banerjee said.

Relief materials consisting of tarpaulins, blankets, water and dry food, were sent over in 30 trucks. The trucks drove into Nepal and materials were handed over to Nepal Urban Development Minister Narayan Khadka. “We are thankful to the West Bengal government for providing the much needed relief, particularly tarpaulins, which are required by the quake-hit people,” Mr. Khadka told journalists.

According to Consul-General of Nepal in Kolkata Chandra Kumar Ghimire, the business community and civil society of West Bengal have been active in providing relief.
