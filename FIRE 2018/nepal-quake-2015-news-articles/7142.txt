Rotary Tasmania's Nepal earthquake appeal has been given a boost by the State Government as the charity group aims to raise $250,000.

Today the Government announced it would donate $10,000 to Rotary Tasmania's Nepal Earthquake Appeal.

More than 7,000 people were killed and thousands more injured and displaced by last month's earthquake.

Braddon MP Joan Rylah said both Rotary and the Government wanted to see the country rebuild.

"This is to support the people of Nepal through the devastation they've suffered," she said.

"This is not the first entry money going in.

"This is long-term aid to redevelop schools and infrastructure projects.

"The Rotary Club of Tasmania has had a long and enduring relationship with the Rotary Club of Hetauda and we believe that this enables a very efficient and excellent long-term way that we can see provision of assistance to the devastation in Nepal."

Rotary Tasmania district governor Ken Moore said he was confident the funds would be put to good use.

"We've had a long-term relationship with the Rotary Club of Hetauda," he said.

"We've currently got school building and water projects under construction.

"Over the last few years, we've developed that relationship and have every confidence in the ability of the Rotarians there to determine what the priorities and needs are following the earthquake devastation."

Rotary Tasmania has also contributed $10,000 toward the appeal itself.
