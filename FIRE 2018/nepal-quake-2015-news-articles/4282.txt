Link Taisha Reed was trekking the Annapurna Circuit when the earthquake hit. She is now safe.

"Virtually all" of the Australians believed to be in Nepal when an earthquake devastated the country on Anzac Day have now been accounted for, Foreign Minister Julie Bishop says.

Ms Bishop told reporters on Thursday the safety of more than 1400 Australians had now been confirmed.

Ms Bishop said there may be other Australians in the country that her department did not know about, and urged any family who had not been able to make contact with their loved ones to call the Department of Foreign Affairs on 1300 555 135.

Two Australian military aircraft loaded with aid supplies such as water purification and hygiene kits, shelter and blankets were expected to land in Kathmandu on Thursday evening.

The two RAAF C-17A Globemaster aircraft, which left Amberley air base in Queensland on Wednesday, will then transport Australians from Kathmandu to the Thai capital, Bangkok, from where they can catch commercial flights home.

Australians unable to secure commercial flights to leave Nepal have been asked to register with Australia's embassy in Kathmandu.

Vulnerable people, such as the sick, elderly and parents with babies will be given priority.

Both aircraft have a capacity of about 100 people.

An Australian consular officer travelled to Lukla, a town near Mount Everest, on Thursday to provide assistance to Australian travellers.

Also on Thursday, two consular officials were expected to travel to Nepal's second largest city, Pokhara, to make contact with Australian travellers there.
