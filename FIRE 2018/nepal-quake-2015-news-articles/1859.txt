[caption id="attachment_24293" align="aligncenter" width="700"] VHP International President Pravin Togadia says that controversial conversion of people into HInduism will continue (File Photo/PTI)[/caption] Claiming that the majority community was not safe in their own country, VHP International President Praveen Togadia on Monday defended 'Ghar Wapsi' aimed at re-converting members of other religious groups into Hinduism and said such events will continue in future too. "Be it any part of the country, the Hindus are not safe," he said at a function held in Deen Dayal Stadium here, without elaborating his views. Defending the programme aimed at strengthening the majority community, Togadia said such events were going on as planned and would continue in future as well. Known for his radical views, the VHP leader rued that the Kashmiri Pandits have been evicted from their own homeland and condemned raising of pro-Pakistan slogans by a separatist leader like Masarat Alam in Jammu and Kashmir recently. Taking strong exception to infiltration of Bangladeshi migrants, Togadia demanded that all infiltrators should be pushed back to their native country. Expressing solidarity with the earthquake ravaged people of Nepal, the VHP leader appealed to all to donate a day's earning towards relief and rehabilitation works underway in the neighbouring country. Togadia urged the temples in India to adopt ravaged shrines in Nepal for re-construction. He appealed to the people living in towns close to Nepal to chip in with relief material and cash so that the supplies could be sent by vehicles from Patna and Gorakhpur tomorrow for those rendered homeless in Nepal due to the earthquake two days ago.
