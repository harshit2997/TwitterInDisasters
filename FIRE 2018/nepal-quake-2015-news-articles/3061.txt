The death toll in Nepal, following a devastating earthquake on Saturday, is now over 3,600 people.

The number is rising by the second.

In Aldershot and Farnborough, many Nepalese families anxiously wait to hear from their loved ones.

They watch heartbreaking images of their home country, destroyed by the 7.9 magnitude quake.

It is the biggest earthquake to hit the country in 80 years.

Young Nepalese doctors, nurses and engineers, living in Hampshire are set to travel to Nepal to help in the relief effort.

Over 6,000 people are injured, and the situation in more remote parts of the country is still unknown.

10 Hampshire firefighters flew out to Nepal's capital Kathmandu last night (26th April).

They will join UK International Search and Rescue crews.

But, the President of the Greater Rushmoor Nepali Community, Major Dewan says it will be a tough job:

"Shock would be the least I can say, but our people are very resilient.

They are used to suffering and hardship.

I think in three of four weeks time, we will know the real damage.

The narrow roads, apart from the main highstreet, it's absolutely narrow, they will have problems even getting a fire engine in.

Sadly in Nepal we don't have that infrastructure or the emergency work force to support such a calamity either."

Major Dewan is heading up a meeting tonight (27th April) to discuss how the Nepalese community living in Rushmoor can support the aid effort.

There is a large Nepali community in the area due to Ghurka links with the British Army.

Major Dewan says he believes the death toll will rise to over 10,000:

"We had in some ways anticipated an earthquake, it was due.

Nepal does fall on the earthquake belt.

It is very painful because, our main worry is these are 3,000 plus accounted for, but once you get through the rubble, I would not be surprised if it's 10,000.

The worrying factor is all you are hearing is news from Kathmandu, because that's the main centre.

Most of the hills are unreachable, so the damage there will be even worse, I think. I hope not, but that would be the reality."

A Farnham mum, who works for a charity in Kathmandu has survived the deadly earthquake with her family.

The Foreign Office has advised that any British Nationals in need of consular assistance call +44 (0) 207 008 0000 or text NEPAL to +447860010026.
