SANTA MONICA, Calif. (AP) Â— A Southern California couple visiting Nepal has not been heard from since the crushing earthquake that struck Nepal.

Friends of 58-year-old A. Michelle Page and 65-year-old Daniel Adams have filed a missing person report with U.S. officials after failing to connect with them.

The Los Angeles Times reports (http://lat.ms/1IcScli) the Santa Monica couple left for Nepal on Tuesday and was planning to stay at a hotel in Kathmandu, close to a Buddhist monument that was toppled by the quake.

Friends say Page visits Nepal twice a year to commission local artists to paint custom "Beware of Dog" signs that adorn most Nepalese homes. She would sell the works to American pet lovers.
