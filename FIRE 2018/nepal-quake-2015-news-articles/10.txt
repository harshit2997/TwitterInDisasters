President Maithripala Sirisena has expressed his and the government’s consolation to the people who fell victim to the devastating earthquake that struck Nepal on Saturday. Issuing a communique earlier Saturday evening, the President’s Media Division says that the Head of State had instructed the respective divisions to provide every possible relief that could be given from the Sri Lankan Government to the people in Nepal.

The communique reads that a special discussion on providing relief to the quake affected Nepal took place on Saturday evening at the Presidential Secretariat presided by the Secretary to the President. It goes on to say that a group of 26 specialist doctors attached to the Sri Lanka Army and four specialist doctors from the Ministry of Health will leave for Nepal at dawn on Sunday.

The communique goes on to say that a consignment of medicine and dry rations will also be sent to Nepal, along with the team of medical personnel. It also says that another medical team of 180 personnel from the Sri Lanka Army are on standby to be sent to Nepal, if the need arises.

At the discussion that took place on Saturday, it was decided that a group of Sri Lankan students in Nepal can return to the country, if they wish to do so, aboard the same C130 Sri Lanka Air Force plane that will carry the medical team to Nepal on Sunday.
