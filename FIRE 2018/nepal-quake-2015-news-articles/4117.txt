Israel is mobilizing all of its resources in Nepal to help locate missing hiker Or Asraf, who has not been in contact with friends or loved ones since a massive earthquake hit the Himalayan country this week.



Foreign Minister Avigdor Liberman convened a briefing at his ministry in Jerusalem on Thursday, during which he pledged that the government would do all it could to track down Asraf.



Liberman also hailed his government’s efforts to aid in the relief efforts in Nepal.



“No other country did as much as Israel in assisting Nepal,” he said.
