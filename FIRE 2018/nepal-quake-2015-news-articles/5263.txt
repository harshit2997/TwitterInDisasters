SEOUL, May 8 (Yonhap) -- South Korea said Friday it is seeking ways to assist in Nepal's reconstruction efforts.

Two weeks after the country was devastated by a powerful earthquake, Nepal has shifted its focus from rescue operations to reconstruction. Nearly 8,000 people were killed, according to official data.

"The (South Korean) government is preparing comprehensive assistance plans for reconstruction and recovery," the Ministry of Foreign Affairs said in a press release,

It added that South Korea's search and rescue team will return home later in the day after a 10-day mission.

Six medics will stay in the Himalayan country, it said.

South Korea has offered US$1 million in initial humanitarian aid.
