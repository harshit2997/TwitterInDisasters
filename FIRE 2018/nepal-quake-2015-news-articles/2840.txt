NEW DELHI: In Shahpur Jat, the Nepalese community is united in grief. Working in Delhi for years, some have lost their family members and property in the earthquake that shook the Himalayan nation.Seema, who works as a saleswoman, has lost seven members of her family in the disaster. The tiny community in this urbanized village has formed a WhatsApp group to share photos so that people back in their respective villages can help them in tracking their families.Deepak Prasad Joshi, who works in Hauz Khas Village's Yeti-The Himalayan Kitchen restaurant, said his family was safe as his hometown, Dhangadhi, is on the far western side of Nepal. "Thankfully, my family is safe but my colleagues' relatives aren't. Some families are untraceable and people are rushing back to their homeland."The Nepalese community in Delhi is a worried lot as their near and dear ones faced what is possibly one of the worst natural disasters to hit Nepal in a long time. But Seema is helpless as flights to Kathmandu are packed and the earthquake has completely flattened her village in Sindhupalchowk district."There is hardly anything left. Cellphones are switched off or . The phones of my neighbours are also not reachable," she said. Her father will travel through Darjeeling to enter Nepal to look for his three brothers. "The images on television are very disturbing and the aftershocks have shattered our hopes."However, Satish Pradhan , who works in Hauz Khas Village, will be leaving on Tuesday. "People are contributing money and three of us are going with details and addresses of some of the families. We will look for them and let the people in Delhi know about their situation."Even the Nepalese in Shahpur Jat have started pooling money. Details and photographs of their family members in Nepal are uploaded on the mobile app. "It is very difficult to reach people in Nepal. We all are glued to the television sets and the images of devastation are very scary," said Joshi.Prakash, who belongs to a village near Pokhra, said that he was worried about the safety of his family and relatives since he can only speak with them sporadically. The unpredictable weather, coupled with loss of communication network in the villages, has made matters worse."I have just returned a month ago from my village. Now I can't return to Nepal at such a short notice since I have no money. I'm hoping my employer will lend me some money to visit my family for a week."
