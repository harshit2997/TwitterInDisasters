Foreign Minister Murray McCully said the Nepalese government asked for help assessing major public infrastructure such as hospitals and government buildings.

Mr McCully said the engineers, who will remain in Nepal for a week, have considerable experience in earthquake strengthening.

He said they will also assess whether a larger group of up to a dozen engineers would be needed for a three-month deployment.

New Zealand has given $2 million in financial assistance to Nepal.

Aftershocks continue to jolt the country, with more than 150 recorded since the main shake.

The death toll has topped 8,000, and hundreds of people are still unaccounted for.
