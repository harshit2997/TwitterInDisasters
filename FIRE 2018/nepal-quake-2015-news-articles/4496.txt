WIU Nepalese Students' and Center for International Studies' "Help Nepal" Fundraiser Set for April 30-May 1 in Union Concourse

April 29, 2015

MACOMB, IL â€” Western Illinois University Nepalese students and WIU's Center for International Studies are sponsoring a "Help Nepal: Every Dollar Counts" fundraiser from 10 a.m.-2 p.m. Thursday-Friday April 30-May 1 in the University Union Concourse.



According to Dana Vizdal, assistant director, orientation and student activities in the Center for International Studies, all proceeds raised will be donated to the Red Cross to help the victims of the recent earthquake in Nepal.



"Fortunately, all of our Nepalese students have been able to communicate with their immediate families," Vizdal said. "Even if you can only give a little, every dollar counts to help the thousands of people impacted by this disaster."



Cash and checks will be accepted (checks made payable to "Western Illinois University") at the fundraising table in the Union Concourse, or checks can be sent via campus mail or regular mail (c/o Dana Vizdal) to:



WIU Center for International Studies

1 University Circle

Memorial Hall 347

Macomb, IL 61455
