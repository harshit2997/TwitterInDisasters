Another powerful earthquake hits Nepal, kills dozens

A magnitude 7.3 earthquake that shook Nepal early this morning killed dozens of people, triggered landslides in the Himalayas near Mount Everest and brought down buildings already weakened by last month’s devastating temblor.

The new earthquake was centered 47 miles east of Kathmandu, and represents the largest aftershock to date since the 7.8 quake that struck April 25, killing more than 8,000 people, according to the U.S. Geological Survey.

Nepal’s National Emergency Operation Center had reported 42 deaths and 1,117 injuries by late afternoon, according to the New York Times. Officials warn that the toll could rise.

Tremors from Tuesday’s quake could be felt as far away as Bangladesh and New Delhi. Witnesses reported seeing rocks and mud crashing down remote hillsides. Aid workers in helicopters reported severe damage to villages.

This comes as many had finally returned to their homes and apartments after camping outside in tents after the first quake. Anup Kaphle, senior foreign editor at Buzzfeed, has been reporting from Kathmandu on collapsed buildings, continued aftershocks and villagers waiting for aid:

And the aid group Doctors for Nepal posted this image of a landslide near the Everest region on Twitter:

The earthquakes are a result of the India plate converging with the Eurasia plate, thrusting the Himalayan mountains upward, according to USGS.
