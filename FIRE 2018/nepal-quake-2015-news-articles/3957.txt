Relief funds sent to Nepal

The government has donated $100,000 to Nepal for humanitarian aid and is searching for Cambodian citizens in the country after a magnitude 7.8 earthquake hit the Kathmandu valley earlier this week, leaving thousands dead.

“The Royal Government of Cambodia hopes that the meager donation will contribute to mitigating the hardship of the victims,” a statement issued on Monday by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs stated.

The capital, Kathmandu, as well as surrounding towns and villages, was severely affected by the quake. As of Tuesday, the death toll in the country had surpassed 4,000 people.

According to the latest UN report on the incident, 8 million people have been affected.

Ministry of Foreign Affairs spokesman Koy Kuong said that the Cambodian Embassy in India, which also handles affairs for Nepal, is monitoring the situation, as well as trying to determine if any Cambodian citizens are currently in the country.

“So far, we have no information [on whether there are] Cambodian citizens living in Kathmandu,” he said.

The Cambodian Red Cross also donated $10,000 through the Nepal Red Cross, according to a statement issued by the organisation.
