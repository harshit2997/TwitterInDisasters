New Delhi, April 27 (IANS) Gorkhas in the Indian Army who want to attend to their families in earthquake-hit Nepal will be allowed to take leave, army officials said on Monday.

"If some Gorkha personnel feel they have to take leave, they can. It will not be a problem," an army official said.

There are some 38,000 Gorkhas in the Indian Army, of which 25,000-28,000 are from Nepal.

"Personnel from Gorkha Rifles 1, 3, 4, 5 and 8 are from that area. We will also be reaching out to the immediate families of these personnel in the Indian Army," the official said.

The army will also take help of ex-servicemen in Nepal during relief and rescue work and while rebuilding the earthquake hit areas, he said.

"There are around 130,000 ex-servicemen in Nepal. These ex-servicemen have a respectable position locally and play a key role in decision-making. They are capable of guiding us to places where relief may be needed," the official said.

Indian Army chief General Dalbir Singh, who belongs to the Gorkha Regiment and is an honorary general of the Nepalese Army, spoke to his counterpart General S.J.B. Rana after the devastating earthquake.

Officials said there was constant coordination with the Nepalese Army.

"The mantra is whatever Nepal requires, we will help them with that," a senior army official said.

The official added that while Nepal had a strong army of over one lakh, they lacked equipment to tackle a crisis of this sort. India would provide such equipment.
