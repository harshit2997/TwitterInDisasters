ALMORA: To keep tabs on human trafficking, immoral activities, child marriage and child labour, an anti-human trafficking unit has been set up at the Pithoragarh district headquarters.Due to a spurt in human trafficking cases following the Nepal earthquake, the police have initiated measures to curb the practice.This is the third human trafficking unit to come up at Kumaon, the other two located in Banbasa near the Indo-Nepal border in Champawat district, and at Haldwani.The Pithoragarh unit will probe trafficking cases surfacing at Bageshwar, while the Haldwani unit will look into complaints from Almora. The unit, located on the premises of Pithoragarh police station, is manned by an in charge and two constables.Sub-inspector Balbir Singh Rana, who heads the Pithoragarh unit, said, "Several areas of Pithoragarh are geographically close to the Nepal border, while others are far-flung and remote. The department has been keeping vigil to curb cases of human trafficking. The district will now have a separate anti-human trafficking cell."To ensure extra vigil, CCTV cameras have been installed at five places in Dharchula town, which shares the border with Nepal.Shedding light on the endeavour, Pithoragarh SP Roshan Lal Sharma, said, "Human trafficking cases have increased after the earthquake. We've installed CCTV cameras at five places. This will help us track down human traffickers across the border. The cameras will also detect illegal mining on the banks of Kali river."Earlier, the Banbasa unit used to probe trafficking cases of Pithoragarh.Within the first week of its operation, the unit has conducted awareness rallies on child labour, child marriage and human trafficking in Jauljibi, Dharchula, Jhulaghat, Balwakot and other remote areas."We've asked villagers to inform us about unidentified people in the village. Information on child marriage, daughters being sold or other trafficking issues can be given on 8476974972. With cooperation from Nepal police, several young women crossing over to the Indian side were asked to return," said Rana.It is learnt that Kumaon DIG P S Sailal had directed police officials in the border district, including the Sashastra Seema Bal (SSB) to remain on alert and keep tabs on trafficking agents at the border.Last month, the Nepal police apprehended a resident of Bareilly after he entered into the Indian side along with a Nepalese woman.Uttarakhand shares a porous 263-km long India-Nepal border in Pithoragarh and Champawat.
