Nepal's Basic Services in Chaos, Help Failing
</headline>

<text>
Anger is erupting in Nepal after buses the government promised failed to arrive, and basic supplies start to run out.

People in Nepal told teleSUR correspondent Aissa Garcia that aid wasn't reaching those who need it most.

Survivors are still traumatized by the earthquake. Ram Maharjan said “I was passing on my motorbike when I saw kids running and didn't know why ... then the roof fell on top of me and I was trapped. I screamed but no one heard. My helmet saved me.”

People are helping each other. Women are cooking for the whole community, in tents, squares, or streets, even in the rain, teleSUR observed.

Nevertheless, needs are mounting, but promised help hasn't arrived.

“Our government, no one has come here after four days to see what is happening,” Kiran Shrestha, a volunteer, said.

“Property has been lost, people are very scared about that. And of course, looking at the magnitude of the earthquake, we thought that there could be another one any time,” Dilendra Shreshta, a survivor, said.

Hospitals are chaotic. Garcia noted while visiting a hospital, “You can feel the despair in every corner of this one. There are emergency rooms set up even in the reception area. Most people here have lost family and their homes.

“My house collapsed. When we heard the noise I ran out with my seven children, but my mother couldn't run and she got caught,” Kalpana Tamang said.

Injured people continue to arrive at the hospitals from outlying areas, but basic supplies are already running out.
