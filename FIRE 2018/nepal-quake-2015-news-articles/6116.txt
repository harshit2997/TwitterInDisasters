Resolve unshaken in Nepal

FACEBOOK Jonathon Clearwater and fiancee Tracey Dearlove in Nepal after the first quake.

A Blenheim man says a second major earthquake in Nepal will not stop his son from continuing to help out in the region.

Jonathon Clearwater, who lives in Okarito on the West Coast, was passing through airport customs when a massive earthquake hit Nepal on April 25.

Clearwater and his fiancee Tracey Dearlove decided to stay and help with the recovery effort following the quake. They were in Nepal when a magnitude 7.3 earthquake hit on Tuesday.

Clearwater's father Ray Clearwater said on Wednesday that he did not think the second earthquake would affect their resolve to continue to contribute to the relief effort.

"I think it will probably make them more determined to stay there.

"It's increased the need - it won't shorten their trip to Nepal."

Ray Clearwater got a text from his wife Jenny while he was playing indoor bowls to tell him about the second quake on Tuesday evening.

When he returned home the pair watched the news on television to catch up on what was happening.

About 10pm, they got a call from a member of the volunteer organisation that Clearwater and Dearlove are with to tell them the couple were safe.

"We were able to breathe a sigh of relief and go to bed to wait and see what the next day brings."

"It's scary stuff."

On Wednesday afternoon, Ray Clearwater had not yet spoken to his son following the Tuesday quake.

Ray and Jenny Clearwater had previously kept up to date with their son's activities through Facebook posts, emails and text messages.

The group that Jonathon Clearwater and Dearlove were part of had been helping people in Nepal by providing food, shelter and building materials to quake-hit communities before the monsoon season hit.

Clearwater and Dearlove had been in contact with Edmund Hillary's granddaughter, who was organising for 1000 tarpaulins to be sent from India.
