It is the first time that the Blue Sky Rescue Team has assisted in overseas rescue efforts



On the morning of April 27, the Blue Sky Rescue Team dispatched a rescue team consisting of 21 members to Nepal to assist in rescue efforts.



It is the first time that the Blue Sky Rescue Team has assisted in overseas rescue efforts, as well as the first time that the Big Dipper Urgent Rescue Command System has been put into operation for an earthquake rescue mission.



With a total investment of more than RMB 2 million, the Big Dipper Urgent Rescue Command System was launched by the Xiamen government last year and is expected to be able to send local information to Xiamen from areas that are out of power and out of range.



9 members of the rescue team, carrying 508 kilograms of equipment, departed from Xiamen and headed to Nepal via the green channel opened by the Xiamen airport. The rescue team is also carrying medicine with a total value of RMB 100,000 to help the earthquake victims.



All of the 21 members of the rescue team have previous rescue experience and are experts in various areas, such as medical care, radio signaling, structural engineering, foreign languages, etc. The plane tickets to Nepal are all at the rescue team memberâ€™s personal expense.
