Israel Defense Forces Humanitarian Aid Mission Arrives In Nepal

Jerusalem, Israel  April 28, 2015 Israel Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, this afternoon at his Jerusalem office, held a consultation on Israels rescue efforts in Nepal.

Israel Defense Minister Moshe Yaalon, Interior Minister Gilad Erdan, Foreign Ministry Director General Nissim Ben-Shetrit, GOC Home Front Maj.-Gen. Yoel Strick and MDA Director General Eli Bein, as well as representatives from the Justice and Public Security ministries, were also in attendance.

We are focusing on two efforts, said Netanyahu.

Our first effort is to locate and rescue Israelis who are in distress in Nepal and enable their safe return home. To this end we are continuing operational and diplomatic activity with the Nepalese government and with other elements.

At the same time, we are operating a field hospital in Nepal to help the Nepalese people in their hour of distress. We are operating under two principles: All Israel is responsible one for the other, and Israel extending a hand in humanitarian assistance in Nepal as it has done in many other places around the world.

It was reported that eleven Israelis are currently defined as not being in contact; the whereabouts of dozens more are known, but it has not been possible to reach them.

Prime Minister Netanyahu ordered that, alongside the efforts to locate and rescue them, consideration be given to the possibilities of dropping them food and means to keep warm, and of reaching them escorted by local security forces.

It was also reported that 338 Israelis so far have returned to Israel, in addition to 25 infants who have already landed in Israel.

IDF Home Front Command briefed participants on progress in setting up a field hospital in Nepal that will be able to treat approximately 200 patients a day.

Prime Minister Netanyahu commended the work of the Foreign Ministry, the Interior Ministry, the IDF and MDA.

Todays discussion is in continuation to the daily assessments that Prime Minister Netanyahu has been holding since the earthquake struck Nepal on Saturday.

Netanyahu spoke with the head of the IDF humanitarian mission to Nepal: Bring home the Israelis, save the people of Nepal. Send my regards to everyone, good luck and keep up the good work!

More than 4,600 people are dead.

Over 9,000 injured. Eight million affected across Nepal whose roads are destroyed or blocked. One million children urgently in need of shelter, food and clothes.

A global support page for Israels Nepal humanitarian efforts has been established at Israel4Nepal.com.

Just another incident pointing out the fact that we have reelected the wrong person.

Where is the Palestinian contingent? Don't hold your breath—too busy planning another assault on Israel.

No mention of "I" or "me" in the White House Blog on the Nepal disaster. What's that tell you? There is a quote from the traitor occupying to office of Secretary of State sending his condolences and best wishes. Michelle might have issued a hash tag "#help Nepal" but I haven't bothered to look.

WOW that was sure fast, Israel getting an Aid team into Nepal so quickly. Israel keeps doing these emergency aid things...

I’m really surprised she can even consider doing these humanitarian helping missions so often, in so many places, when she herself is under constant threat and frequent attack right there in Jersalem/Israel/at home. Way to Go, Israel!

(Now keep your eyes open and your powder dry, because O is trying to get another war going against you...)

it’s safer being in Israel than in Baltimore right now.



To: Fungi

They're sending their crack debris clearing teams.



To: MinorityRepublican

Yes, alas, Baltimore is a real mess. Too much agitation from outside including washDC obviously but some of same promoters in Baltimore as were behind the violence in Missouri ( per this afternoon’s news report) — just awful — such things used to be busted up and prosecuted. But elections have consequences and there’s no such remedy in sight.
