KATHMANDU, May 12 -- At least 11 people were killed and 300 others injured after a powerful 7.4-magnitude earthquake hit Nepal on Tuesday.

According to the Home Ministry, four people were confirmed dead in Kathmandu, including one each in Teku, Sundarijal, Balaju and Tangal of the capital.

"Five persons have been dead" in Sindhupalchowk, the worst-hit district in the massive 7.9-magnitude on April 24 that has left more than 8,000 people dead, Surendra Pradhan, an officer at Local Development Office in district headquarters of Chautara, told Xinhua.

Most of the cracked houses in Chautara collapsed and some 300 people have been injured in the latest quake, a police officer said.

Another two deaths were reported in Lalitpur and Dolakha districts.

Helicopters with medical teams have already been dispatched to most quake-hit districts Sindhupalchowk and Dolakha, the Home Ministry said.
