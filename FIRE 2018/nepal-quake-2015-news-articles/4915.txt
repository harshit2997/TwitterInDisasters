Rotary club launches aid appeal for Nepal
</headline>

<text>
An appeal for emergency aid has been launched by the Sudbury Talbot Rotary Club following the devastating earthquake in Nepal on Saturday.

Around eight million people, which equates to more than a quarter of the country’s population, have been affected by the quake, with the death toll currently at 4,310.

Both rotary clubs in Sudbury have donated funds to support the aid effort and help with the immediate rescue operation, but there will be a continuing need for funds to help rebuild the infrastructure and schools.

Sudbury Talbot Rotary Club president Bill Haldane said: “We will ensure that every penny sent will go towards rebuilding the lives of those affected.”

Those wanting to donate should make cheques payable to Sudbury Talbot Rotary Club and send them to Bill Haldane, St Mary’s Hall, 83 Hall Street, Long Melford, CO10 9TJ.
