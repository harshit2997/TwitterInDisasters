With the Assembly polls due in October-November, Chief Minister Nitish Kumar and the Opposition BJP appear to be competing with each other to reach out to the earthquake victims entering Bihar from Nepal.

In the last two days, Mr. Kumar and two Union Ministers have visited camps and hospitals to review the relief operations. The Chief Minister took the lead, listing the steps taken for relief and sending a 30-member medical team and 32 buses to Nepal for evacuating those desirous of entering Bihar or going to other places.

The government then opened a camp in Raxaul, a town bordering Nepal, and put all government hospitals and doctors on alert. In Patna, Bettiah and Sitamarhi, camps were opened for packaging ‘ready-to-eat’ food for distribution in Nepal.

“The government is sensitive to the earthquake victims of Nepal, and we’ll do our best to reach out to the people there,” Mr. Kumar said.

On Wednesday, Union Ministers Ananth Kumar and Radha Mohan Singh visited the Patna Medical College and Hospital to meet the injured.
