The 7.8-magnitude earthquake that struck Nepal claimed more than 5,000 lives and left many more homeless. It leveled many historical buildings and sent shock waves throughout the region. To help aid the people of Nepal, Hyundai Motors has donated Rs 1.9 crore to the Nepal Red Cross Society.

Commenting on the donation, Sanqmin Park, Head of Hyundai Motor’s Asia and Pacific Regional Headquarters, said, “We would like to express our sincere condolences and best wishes to the thousands of people affected by the earthquake, as well as our hopes that the damage can be repaired as soon as possible. The global response to this tragedy has been extraordinary, and Hyundai Motor will be looking into additional ways to support the ongoing relief and rebuilding efforts.”

Alongside its donation to NRCS, Hyundai Motor will be assisting motorists in Nepal, for example with the Before Service – repairing damaged cars, and through special discounts on service and parts.

As part of its global CSR initiatives, Hyundai Motor Group has donated to a number of projects bringing much needed relief to areas affected by large-scale natural disasters, including the earthquake in Indonesia’s Yogyakarta in 2006; forest fires at Ileia, Peloponnese, Greece in 2007; China’s Sichuan earthquake in 2008; Haiti’s earthquake in 2009; Chile’s earthquake in 2010; tornados in the US in 2011; and the typhoon in Thailand in 2013.
