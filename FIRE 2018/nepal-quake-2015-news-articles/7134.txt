North Cotswold Rotarians rally round for Nepalese earthquake victims

NORTH Cotswold Rotary Club members with links to Nepal have been rallying round to help those left devastated by the earthquake at the end of April.

The club initially responded with a £2,000 donation for disaster relief, channelled through ShelterBox and the Disasters Emergency Committee. Then in early May Rotarians and their families organised a street collection in Bourton which raised £1,200 which was divided between ShelterBox and Aqua Box water purification kits.

Those donating in Bourton were able to look inside a ShelterBox which costs £690 and provides shelter, cooking equipment and other essentials.

Several members of North Cotswolds Rotary Club have been to Nepal on a number of occasions and have maintained close links with local Nepalese people they met. Ernie Rumsey and his wife Karen have fond memories of Nepal, and they have been saddened to see the extent of the devastation to places they have come to love over the years.

“When I saw how the remote and beautiful village of Langtang, where we stayed for several nights, had been completely buried under tons of mud and rocks, it brought tears to my eyes,” said Ernie. “I have a Nepalese friend in the Kathmandu valley who has lost his home but he survived, and he is now doing all he can to help other survivors. I am exploring ways of getting help to him so he can continue his good work.” Another club member, Mike Boyes, has also been to Nepal three times, once with his wife Maggie on a ten-day trek to Tengboche Monastery within site of Mount Everest.

“The Nepalese are such lovely and resilient people, “ he said. "But the sheer scale of this disaster means that they are going to need our help for years to come.”

North Cotswolds Rotary Club will be examining ways of contributing to reconstruction projects through Rotary contacts in Nepal. “We will look for the best way to help fund the rebuilding of a village school or medical centre,” said club president Hugh Collins.

As s a step towards that aim, club member John Hackling of John Hackling (Transport) Ltd generously waived all parking charges at the company’s car park in Bourton on Saturday May 9 to enable club members to collect for Nepal. A total of £1400 was raised from a combination of parking contributions and from bus passengers and passers-by.

Club president Hugh Collins added:“So far our club has donated or set aside a total of £4600 for Nepal, and we hope to do more in the future.”
