DAYTON, Ohio (WDTN) – The American Red Cross is helping people in our area who wish to make a donation in the name of the victims of the Nepal earthquake.

To make a donation, call the Dayton Red Cross chapter at 937-222-0124. Apple Inc. is also providing a link to an online giving site from its iTunes web site.

The Red Cross also established the Restoring Family Links web site to assist those to reach friends and families in Nepal. People in Nepal can register that they are alive. People outside the country can also register missing loved ones they haven’t heard from since the quake.

More than 1,500 people are registered on the site already.

Restoring Family Links caseworkers are available locally to help people try and make contact with loved ones. You can reach a caseworker at 1-513-579-3000.

“We are extremely concerned about the people of Nepal as well as those in Greater Dayton who have loved ones in that part of the world,” says Laura Seyfang, executive director of the Dayton-Area Chapter. “We are committed to helping those affected by the disaster in whatever way we can, either through utilizing our own resources or by working cooperatively with the Red Cross nationally or internationally.”

No local disaster specialists were deployed to Nepal at this time, although Red Cross specialists from other national locations were sent there.

AT&T is also offering free services to try and reach loved ones in Nepal. Visit AT&T Nepal Relief Efforts on line for more information.

Wright State University is one of the only places in the area with a seismometer to measure things like earthquake activity. The instruments they use are sensitive enough to have picked up data from the earthquake in Nepal. It is something experts says we should not worry about locally.

“We’re in a different place on earth and we’re in the interior of a continent as opposed to Nepal,” said Ernest Hauser, Associate Professor of Geophysics. “But luckily we are in a continental interior where mostly earthquakes are more of a curiosity to us than an immediate danger.”

Most of the recent seismic activity in Ohio has been tied to fracking.
