Kathmandu: A third batch of medical volunteers, that consists of senior doctors and specialists, has arrived in Nepal to work as part of the UAE medical volunteers team. The UAE medical team is providing treatment for people affected by the earthquake that killed about 8,000 people and injured 17,000.

The move comes as part of an initiative launched by the Zayed Giving Initiative, Saudi German Hospital and Dar Al Ber Society, in cooperation with the Kathmandu University Hospital.

Dr Reem Othman, Executive Director of the Saudi-German Hospital and ambassador of humanitarian work, said that the third batch of medical volunteers reached Nepal to join the UAE-Nepalese joint medical team, which has been operating for several weeks to ease the suffering of hundreds of people affected by the quake.

She stressed that none of the UAE volunteers were affected by the strong new quake that hit Nepal on Tuesday.
