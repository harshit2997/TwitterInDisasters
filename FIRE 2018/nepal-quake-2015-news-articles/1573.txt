Kiwi USAR team heads to quake stricken Nepal

Peter Meecham/FairfaxNZ USAR team members will be self-sufficient when they arrive in Nepal.

A New Zealand Urban Search and Rescue (USAR) team is heading to earthquake stricken Nepal with the ultimate goal of saving lives.

A team of 37 experts gathered in Auckland on Sunday to prepare 10 tonnes of equipment.

The Auckland City fire station was humming as the team loaded up generators, rescue gear, batteries and food.

Peter Meecham/FairfaxNZ USAR team members loading up some of the 10 tonnes of equipment which they will be taking to Nepal for a 14 day deployment.

They were due to fly out to Singapore just before midnight, then on to Kathmandu, where a devastating earthquake struck on Saturday.

More than 3200 people are known to have died and at least 6500 were injured as a result of the earthquake.

Peter Meecham/FairfaxNZ USAR team members will leave for Nepal on Monday night.

Task forces leader Gavin Travers said; "We want to add some value to the rescue efforts. The ultimate goal for us would be for us help rescue live victims."

Victims trapped in earthquake rubble sometimes remained alive for many days.

The New Zealand USAR team will deploy in Kathmandu and planned to stay two weeks.

"We'll arrive fully self-sufficient, so that we don't add to any burden. We'll carry our own food, water purification, and ablutions."

The team was drawn from New Zealand Fire Service members in Auckland, Palmerston North and Christchurch.

Included were technical rescue experts, paramedics, a doctor, a structural engineer, and logistics personnel.

Many of those being mobilised were involved in USAR during the 2011 Christchurch earthquake response, Travers said.

Some had also recently travelled to Vanuatu in the aftermath of Tropical Cyclone Pam.

Foreign Minister Murray McCully said Nepal had accepted the offer of a USAR team.

"New Zealand is deeply moved by the devastation and human suffering these quakes have caused and our response reflects our close ties with the people of Nepal."

New Zealand Fire Service national commander Paul Baxter said the deployment was provisionally for two weeks, but that could be extended if the situation demanded.
