Nepal earthquake vigil in Hobart’s Franklin Square

PREPARATIONS for a candlelight vigil have provided a much needed diversion for Nepalese students at the University of Tasmania as they struggle to come to terms with the horror of Saturday’s devastating earthquake.

UTAS has about 400 Nepalese students at its campuses, most of whom are expected to gather in Franklin Square for the vigil at 5.30pm tomorrow.

MORE: FEARS FOR MISSING TASSIE PAIR

Arts student Rajeev Chakradhar, 22, from Kathmandu, said he was among the lucky ones able to confirm that families were okay, but the hardships faced by loved ones was making it difficult for students to concentrate on work, study or anything else.

“They are camping outside, with the fear of another earthquake,’’ Mr Chakradhar said.

Pharmacy PhD student Aarati Khanal, 22, said she had endured an unbearable 24 hours before she was able to contact her family in Bokhara.

Ms Khanal said for many of the UTAS students from more mountainous districts it could be days before they heard word of their families.

She said one of her companions was heading back to Nepal after learning of the death of a father.

Ms Khanal said tomorrow’s vigil was also a plea to the wider community for understanding and for help, with all donations at the event going to a Red Cross appeal.
