THREE weeks ago, University of Southern Queensland post-doctorate student Rohan Muni Bajracharya was in Kathmandu celebrating his marriage with family and friends.

He returned to Toowoomba with his new wife Dr Bibhushana Shrestha to continue his studies when he heard his home country of Nepal had been hit by a devastating magnitude 7.9 earthquake.

"I felt helpless and numb," Mr Bajracharya said.

"As did my wife who is a medical doctor. She felt she should have been there to help, even to help just one."

Mr Bajracharya received the news that his family members were safe in Kathmandu, but living with relatives as their house was damaged.

Further information came through intermittently of family and friends who were missing, injured and had lost their homes.

"All the mobile phones jammed, but as my sister was trying to get something out of our house, I was able to contact her through landline last Saturday. I told her to stay out of the house."

Mr Bajracharya, who is the president of the Nepalese Association of Toowoomba USQ Society, met with staff at the USQ Phoenix Central last week to brainstorm ways to help.

In response, united in their desire to help, the USQ community held fundraising events in support of the Nepalese earthquake victims.USQ Phoenix Central, the USQ Charity Committee and Campus Catering People joined the Nepalese Association of Toowoomba on campus last Wednesday.

Deputy Vice-Chancellor (students and communities) Carl Rallings said the group's joint efforts raised more than $4900.

"Campus Catering People raised over $2300 from the sale of Nepalese food in the refectory," he said.

"Phoenix Central in collaboration with the USQ Charity Committee and Nepalese Association of Toowoomba raised over $2600."

In addition to the funds, Phoenix Central received donations of blankets, tents and sleeping bags and will continue to collect these items over the next week.

"I would like to thank everyone who has contributed, your generosity and support is greatly appreciated," Mr Rallings said.

For those wanting to help donations can be made via the Nepalese Association of Toowoomba (NAT) http://www.natoowoomba.org in conjunction with the Non Residential Nepalese Association of Australia http://www.nrn.org.au.
