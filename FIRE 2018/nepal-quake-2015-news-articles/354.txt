As fears of a humanitarian disaster grew, thousands of people braved freezing temperatures to sleep on pavements, in parks or in fields, too afraid to return to homes damaged by a 7.9 magnitude quake which struck at midday on Saturday.

"We have launched a massive rescue and rehabilitation action plan and lots needs to be done," said Information and Broadcasting Minister .

"Our country is in a moment of crisis and we will require tremendous support and aid," he told Indian television.

The home ministry said the death toll had reached 1,382. A police spokesman said more than 630 of them were killed in and at least 300 more in the capital.

Foreign climbers and their Nepalese guides around Mount were caught by the tremors and a huge avalanche. Some took to social media to send desperate messages for assistance, warning that otherwise more people would die.

Hospitals across the impoverished nation of 28 million people struggled to cope with the dead and injured from 's worst quake in 81 years, and a lack of equipment meant rescuers could look no deeper than surface rubble for signs of life.

, a staff member of the Bhaktapur Hospital on the outskirts of , said that around 50 bodies were lying in a field outside.

Doctors were treating patients in a makeshift tent next to the main building, and staff were too busy to count or register names of the casualties.

"It's chaos here," Pokharel said.

PEOPLE STILL TRAPPED

The earthquake, centered 50 miles (80 km) east of the second city, Pokhara, was all the more destructive for being shallow.

Areas of were reduced to rubble, and rescue operations had still not begun in some remote areas.

Among the capital's landmarks destroyed in the earthquake was the 60-meter-high (100-foot) , built in 1832 for the queen of , with a viewing balcony that had been open to visitors for the last 10 years.

A jagged stump 10 meters high was all that was left of the lighthouse-like structure. As bodies were pulled from the ruins, a policeman said up to 200 people had been trapped inside.

Across the city, rescuers scrabbled through the rubble of destroyed buildings, among them ancient, wooden Hindu temples.

"I can see three bodies of monks trapped in the debris of a collapsed building near a monastery," Indian tourist Devyani Pant told Reuters. "We are trying to pull the bodies out and look for anyone who is trapped."

Neighboring , where 44 people were reported killed in the quake and its aftershocks, was first to respond to calls for help, sending military aircraft with medical equipment and relief teams.

The said 285 members of the National Disaster Response Force had been sent to assist the Nepalese army in the rescue effort.

TRAGEDY IN THE MOUNTAINS

An mountaineering team found 18 bodies on Mount , where an avalanche unleashed by the earthquake swept through base camp. More than 1,000 climbers had gathered there at the start of the climbing season.

A tourism official, , said it was "hard to even assess what the death toll and the extent of damage" around could be.

"The trekkers are scattered all around the base camp and some had even trekked further up. It is almost impossible to get in touch with anyone."

Around 300,000 foreign tourists were estimated to be in various parts of for the spring trekking and climbing season in the Himalayas, and officials were overwhelmed by calls from concerned friends and relatives.

Romanian climber tweeted that there had been a "huge earthquake then huge avalanche" at base camp, forcing him to run for his life.

In a later tweet he made a desperate appeal for a helicopter to fly in and evacuate climbers who had been hurt: "Many dead. Much more badly injured. More to die if not heli asap."
