The President of the Kentucky Nepali Society says there are hundreds of Nepales here in Central Kentucky who are hurting right now, seeing what's happened around Kathmandu. He hopes to fill Triangle Park this evening with support for his homeland.

Sailesh Manadhar moved to the US to become an electrical engineer. He said it was tough to move so far away from home.

"You miss home. You miss home-cooked meals. You miss talking in Nepalese," Manadhar said.

He found comfort in the Kentucky Nepali Society, connecting him with other Nepalese in Kentucky. He's now the president, and he's hoping the organization can offer support after the earthquake in Kathmandu.

"Now, seeing it crumbling to pieces is really hard because those are the very temples and the very places that I used to stay," Manadhar said.

Sunday evening at 7:00, Manadhar and the rest of the Kentucky Nepali Society will gather at Triangle Park in a show of support for their homeland. Manadhar said they would pray for the people dealing with the aftermath in Kathmandu as well as those who died in the earthquake.

"We are gathering here to support each other, comfort each other, and collectively pray for Nepal," he said.

Manadhar is also working to organize a collection drive so people can donate blankets and other items to send to Nepal. He knows it's going to be a long road ahead.

"I feel a big chunk of Nepalese history's been lost...they'll need to rebuild," he said.
