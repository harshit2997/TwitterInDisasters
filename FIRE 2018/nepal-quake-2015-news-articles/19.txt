French President Francois Hollande on Saturday said France was ready to respond to any request from Nepal "for aid and assistance" following a massive 7.8 magnitude quake in the Himalayan nation that killed more than 800 people.

Hollande expressed "France's solidarity with the authorities and people of Nepal" following the devastating quake, a statement from his Elysee office said. Scores of people are still feared trapped in collapsed homes around the country.
