Unprecedented assistance has been offered to Nepal through the International Humanitarian City

Once again Dubai has shown its humanitarian face to the world by adopting a rapid action response to the earthquake in Nepal, which has claimed the lives of over 7,500 people. Dubai has, through its multiple relief missions, organised via the state-of-the-art International Humanitarian City, offered unprecedented assistance to the survivors despite innumerable challenges on the ground in Kathmandu. Many countries have joined hands for the various relief programmes in Nepal and the UAE has stood up to be counted, time and again, in making a statement of intent of being a responsible and sensitive global player.

The International Humanitarian City caters to this specific purpose. It is well placed logistically to reach any part of the world, in the event of a crisis, and the authorities promptly ordered the supply of huge amounts of support in coordination with the United Nations Humanitarian Response Depot (UNHRD), registered charities and other partners. The Humanitarian City, born out of the vision of His Highness Shaikh Mohammad Bin Rashid Al Maktoum, Vice-President and Prime Minister of the UAE and Ruler of Dubai, has grown to become one of the world’s largest and busiest hubs for humanitarian aid. Its body of work across the globe, especially the capacity to respond to emergencies, is well documented. Dubai’s actions have repeatedly set an example to the international community. Its commitment, in the face of all the odds, has been unwavering and the example it sets is worth emulating. This philosophy, adopted by the country’s rulers, trickles down to the citizens and serves as an example to all.
