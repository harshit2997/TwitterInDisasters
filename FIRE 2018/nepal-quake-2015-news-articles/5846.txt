A five-month-old infant is among six people who survived miraculously from a deadly earthquake in Nepal which left over 6,000 dead.

The infant Sonit Awal was located under a collapsed house in Bhaktapur by a team of search-and-rescue workers from Nepal’s Army on Sunday with the help of a fiber-optic camera.

He was rescued by the team after carefully moving bricks one by one from the debris before reaching him.

Krishna Chandra Paudel, in charge of a relief center in Bhaktapur, said the infant was treated for only minor injuries at the local hospital.

Elsewhere, a 15-year-old boy was rescued and was pulled out alive nearly five days after the devastating incident and was treated for only minor injuries.

The teenager Pemba Tamang was rescued by Nepal’s armed police and a group of rescue specialists from France with the help excavators.

Another 26-year-old man was pullout of debris on Tuesday night after more than 80 hours tapped beneath concrete slabs in a collapsed flophouse in Katmandu.

An 11-year-old girl was also rescued from the remains of her house by Nepal’s army nearly 70 hours after the temblor on Tuesday night in Bhaktapur.

The Nepal’s army and residents also rescued two elderly women in their 70s from the Shiv Dunga neighborhood of the Katmandu Valley on Wednesday night from the debris of an apartment building.
