PATNA: In a one-of-its-kind study, AIIMS-Patna has done a rapid epidemiological assessment of devastation caused in Nepal by April 25 earthquakes.A 22-doctor team of AIIMS-Patna visited Nepal on the invite of Nobel Medical College and Teaching Hospital and did a rapid assessment of how much resource allocation must be done to different areas of rehabilitation. The study that included the quake-affected population of Nepal and Bihar will be shared with disaster management experts of Bihar and Nepal soon.In terms of injuries to people, the assessment says at least 50,000 people are likely to have fractured and dislocated limbs, simple or compound injuries with or without vascular complications (injury to artery or vein), requiring immediate hospital care like splint, X-ray, plaster or external fixation. Later, at least half of them would need definitive treatment like open reduction and internal fixation. Over 2,000 would even need rehabilitation, says the study authored by AIIMS director Dr G K Singh and others.The study also says at least 12, 600 people suffered life-threatening injuries like head injury, chest-abdomen crush, serious exposure to collapse or cold. The study coined a term, PINES (Post Nepal India Earthquake Syndrome), which includes problems like vertigo, vomiting, headache, confusion and fear which has affected at least 40% of the population in areas east of Kosi and Nepal. "This study is first of its kind and will help policymakers allocate resources accordingly," Dr Singh said.The study cites a paper of Iran's academic M R Naghii, which says death after an earthquake may be instant or delayed due to dehydration, hypertension or fall in body temperature. The next most common problems are the fractures which do not require hospitalization. However, a surprisingly large number of patients require acute care for non-surgical problems such as acute cardiac arrest, exacerbation of chronic diseases such as diabetes or hypertension, anxiety and other mental health problems such as depression, the study says quoting the paper.The AIIMS-P study estimated at least 12,000 houses were violently shaken. Of these, over 6,000 houses collapsed.Thy study said 70% of Nepal today is without roads and existing roads are likely to be affected by landslides. In such a scenario, AIIMS-Patna says, its 'sankatmochan nagriks' and Chhattisas (locals trained by doctors) can be of help in connecting the victims to doctors in AIIMS through telemedicine.
