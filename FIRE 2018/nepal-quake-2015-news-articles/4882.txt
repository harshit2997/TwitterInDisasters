Dubai: Anyone wishing to send money to Nepal will not be paying any transfer charges for one month.

The offer is available to customers remitting funds through Xpress Money’s outlets in the UAE, Bahrain, Kuwait, Oman and Qatar and all UAE Exchange centres around the world.

According to the two companies, which announced the waiver of transfer fees this week, the move is to express solidarity with the victims of the earthquake that hit the country recently.

The offer is valid from May 1 to May 31, 2015 for Xpress Money customers, and from April 27 to May 27, 2015 for those making transfers through UAE Exchange shops.

UAE Exchange, which operates 750 branches across 32 countries, has just turned over 10 million Nepalese rupees (about Dh365,000) to the government of Nepal to support relief efforts in the quake-hit country.

"Our commitment is to support people in their hour of crisis and Nepal directly needs support at this time. It is in this context that we have waived the service fee on remittance services," said Promoth Manghat Dy, CEO of UAE Exchange.

Xpress Money is also looking at other options to send aid, including medicines and first aid kits, to the earthquake victims and their families.

Employees of Xpress Money are contributing cash separately and the money collected will be turned over to a non-government organization that is directly working with the people of Nepal.

“The Nepal earthquake has impacted the lives of millions of people living in the country and around the world. Nothing that we do can fill the void that the human losses have created. However, we are hoping to bring some relief to those affected through these humble initiatives,” said Sudhesh Giriyan, COO of Xpress Money.

“We pray that the survivors gather enough strength and courage, to start afresh and move on with their lives.”
