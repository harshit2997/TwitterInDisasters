Vodafone provides support for Nepal

Vodafone will credit its New Zealand customers’ calls and TXTs to Nepal following the devastating 7.9 magnitude earthquake that struck the country on Saturday.

This includes mobile, residential and business calls made to landlines and mobile phones in Nepal. The retrospective credit will apply to calls and TXTs made from 5.00pm Saturday 25th April to 5.00pm Tuesday 28th April (NZ time) and will be applied to customers’ accounts. However Vodafone is urging customers to use TXT to communicate with loved ones in Nepal, so that traffic on heavily congested local networks can be prioritised for emergency communications.

Vodafone has contacted customers roaming in Nepal, providing them with the emergency phone number for the New Zealand Consulate and a link to www.safetravel.govt.nz.

Matt Williams, Vodafone’s Consumer Director, says the company’s thoughts are with the people of Nepal at this difficult time.

“The impact of Saturday’s earthquake is significant– with the tragedy having now claimed over 3000 lives and injuring thousands more. It has crippled infrastructure, damaged homes and devastated communities.

“We are also mindful of New Zealanders with loved ones in Nepal or with close ties to a nation we’ve shared so much with in the past. Crediting calls and TXTs is something simple we can do to help Kiwis during this time."
