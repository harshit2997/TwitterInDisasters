THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: Cabinet on Wednesday decided to set up Nepal Earthquake Relief Fund to support the victims of the natural calamity that devastated the hill nation.

At the Cabinet briefing, Chief Minister Mr Ommen Chandy said that the Government would contribute Rs 2 crore for the relief fund. The Ministers would contribute Rs 10,000 each.

He said the bodies of Dr Deepak Thomas and Dr Irshad would be brought by Indian Airlines flight on Wednesday. Dr Abin Suri who suffered renal failure after being seriously injured in the earthquake has been admitted to the All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS).

Information and NORKA Minister K C Joseph was in touch with the doctors. Mr Chandy said that more Indian Airlines flights and IAF aircraft were operating now to bring back the standard Indians.

Aranmula airport project: When asked about Environment Minister Prakash Javdekar statement on the one hand that the Centre would not allow Aranmula project on the one hand and the MoEF nod to get the clearance, Mr Chandy said; “I have no idea. Please ask him.”

“As far as the state government is concerned, our stand is clear right from the beginning. The previous LDF government had given all sanctions. We decide not to oppose the project. It is company’s need to get the Centre’s sanction. It is not state government’s duty. If they come with the permission, the government will do whatever is required. The sanction is to be given by Centre and to be taken by the company,” the chief minister said.
