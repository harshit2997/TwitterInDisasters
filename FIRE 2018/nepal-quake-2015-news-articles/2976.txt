NEW DELHI: NGOs and Resident Welfare Associations in the city have started raising funds and collecting relief material for those left stranded in Nepal. While some have already dispatched the goods, others are awaiting permissions from departments.The NGOs have also activated their regional centers near the Nepal border in UP and Bihar to transport the relief material faster. "A team of 150 people is working in Kathmandu. Goods for earthquake victims in Nepal have already been dispatched from our centres in UP and Bihar. More material will leave Delhi tomorrow. We are also assessing the damage in Bihar, apart from raising funds globally," said Kaushik Mitra, head of marketing and communications, CARE India. Goods being sent include blankets, mats and 1,500 hygiene kits for women, Mitra said.Other organizations like Medecins Sans Frontieres/Doctors Without Borders—an independent medical organisation—have taken up responsibility of providing medical assistance and setting up camps in Nepal. "Four teams left from Bihar on Sunday. Conditions in Nepal are extremely difficult. We are also trying to get more emergency supplies from Europe," said Nancy Barrett, MSF's communications head.The Confederation of NCR RWAs said that they will meet soon to finalize how they can help those in Nepal. "We will collect funds and I will soon hold a meeting regarding this. Funds and relief material would be collected and sent through the Prime Minister's relief fund. We hope to collect a huge quantity of relief goods," said Chetan Sharma, general secretary of the RWA confederation.Another Delhi-based non-profit organization, waiting for permissions, said their trucks are loaded and standing at the border. "We also have people in Nepal and adjoining states to help provide assistance," said Meenakshi Gupta, founder member of Goonj.
