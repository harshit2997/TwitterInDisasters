Unicef Malaysia launches emergency appeal for children of Nepal
</headline>

<text>
KUALA LUMPUR: UNICEF is mobilising an urgent response to meet the needs of children affected by yesterday's earthquake in Kathmandu, Nepal.

The 7.9 earthquake is being described as the worst in over 80 years. Thousands of people, including children, spent the night on the streets, fearing to return to their homes in case of aftershocks.

Many buildings have been destroyed, cellphone networks are down in many areas; and power is out.

"When emergencies hit - they hurt children most. With children accounting for more than 40 per cent of Nepal’s population, UNICEF, together with our partners, is rushing to deliver critical supplies to children and families in the immediate aftermath of the earthquake," said UNICEF Representative to Malaysia, Wivina Belmonte.

UNICEF's first priorities are focused on life-saving interventions – finding and caring for survivors with essential medicines, nutrition, safe water and hygiene kits to children and families. Given Nepal’s vulnerability to earthquakes, UNICEF has pre-positioned supplies, including water purification tablets, hygiene kits, tarpaulins and nutrition supplies within the country, with additional materials ready to be flown in. UNICEF is also working with the government and other partners to meet children’s immediate needs in the areas of water and sanitation, child protection, health, nutrition and education.

"Children who have survived terrible devastation such as this need urgent assistance," added Ms. Belmonte.

"Many children would be in a state of shock, having lost their families and homes, and been traumatized by the earthquake and its after shocks. We're particularly concerned about their health, due to the impact of the earthquake on food supply, water, access to medical services and sanitation systems."

UNICEF Malaysia has launched the "Nepal Earthquake Children’s Appeal" to respond to the needs of children and families most affected by this tragedy. Those who wish to donate to the Appeal in Ringgit Malaysia can visit https://unicef.my/donations/emergency to make a secure online donation via credit card; or issue a crossed cheque or bank transfer payable to 'UNITED NATIONS CHILDREN'S FUND-EMERGENCY'.
