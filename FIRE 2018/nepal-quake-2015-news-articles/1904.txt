</headline>

<text>
Teams from international medical organisation Médecins Sans Frontières/Doctors Without Borders (MSF) have started to arrive in Nepal and are currently assessing the most urgent medical needs. Further teams are expected to arrive in Nepal later today and over the coming days.

One 17-member team is in Kathmandu. They have carried out an initial assessment of the damage by helicopter.

Another team is expected in Kathmandu today after flying in from New Delhi. They were initially rerouted back to India after aftershocks prevented their plane from landing.

One team has reached Gorkha, 70 km northwest of Kathmandu, after travelling by road from Bihar state in India. Three trucks containing essential relief items have also crossed the Nepalese border and are on their way to Gorkha.

An 11-member surgical and medical team is on its way to Kathmandu from Brussels with a ‘rapid intervention surgical kit’ which will enable them to set up a surgical unit and start performing surgical operations within the vital 72-hour window after the earthquake struck. The team will also travel to the districts of Tanahu, Lamjung and Gorkha, with the aim of providing support to hospitals, running mobile clinics, distributing essential relief items (blankets, hygiene kits and shelters), and providing water and sanitation, according to people’s needs.

A 5-member team (including a surgeon) left Japan on 27 April for Kathmandu.

An inflatable hospital and supplies of drugs will be dispatched from MSF’s supply depot in Bordeaux, France on 28 April.

Thirty tons of emergency supplies were dispatched from MSF’s supply depot in Ostende, Belgium on 27 April.

A team of medics and water and sanitation specialists left Amsterdam for Nepal on 27 April

Four teams left Bihar state, India, on 26 April. They are currently at the Nepalese border on their way to the worst affected areas.

A 3-member team (including a midwife) is due to arrive in Pokhara on 27 April.

A 3-member team (including a midwife and an anaesthetist) left Paris on 27 April.

A 35 tons charter with inflatable hospital and drugs will depart from Bordeaux, France on 28 April.

MSF’s history in Nepal

MSF worked in Nepal from 2002 to 2009, when teams provided healthcare to people affected by conflict, including basic healthcare, reproductive healthcare and water and sanitation provision. MSF left Nepal in 2009, handing its work over to government agencies and development organisations with a longer-term approach to covering people’s health needs.
