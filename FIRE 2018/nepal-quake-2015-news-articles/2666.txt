There are around 50 students hailing from different parts of Nepal who are at PEC.



While half of them are undergoing internship training, the others are pursuing civil engineering. But all of them are shaken to the core, scared that tragedy might strike again back home. â€œThough our families are safe, the fear of another earthquake is still there,â€ said Devashish, a final-year student.
