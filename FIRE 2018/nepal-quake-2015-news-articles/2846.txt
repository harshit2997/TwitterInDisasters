No Georgian citizens are reported to be among the victims of the Nepal earthquake, although there were several Georgian tourist groups in Nepal when the powerful earthquake hit the country.

Georgia’s Ambassador to India, who is also accredited to Thailand, Sri Lanka and Nepal, visited the devastated area yesterday.

Nizharadze also met Nepal’s Interior Minister and United Nations’ Nepal office representatives and discussed possible ways of how to help the affected population.

The Nepali authorities confirmed there were no Georgian citizens among the deceased or injured, the Ambassador said.

Today, Nizharadze will meet another group of Georgian tourists in Nepal, most of whom are expected to return to Georgia tomorrow.

Thousands of people were killed in the earthquake in Nepal and about two dozen were killed in a corresponding avalanche on Mount Everest last week.
