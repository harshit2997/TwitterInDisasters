Canada pledges $5M for Nepal earthquake relief
</headline>

<text>
The Canadian government has pledged $5 million to help Nepal recover from a powerful earthquake that has killed more than 1,800 people, the foreign affairs department says.

The magnitude 7.9 quake, Nepal’s worst in 81 years, sent tremors through northern India on Saturday and triggered an avalanche on Mount Everest.

The Canadian government said in a statement late Saturday it is sending its Disaster Assistance Response Assessment Team and officials are working to ensure Canadians in Nepal are OK.

“Our officials in the region are working with Nepalese and Indian authorities to ensure that any Canadians affected by the earthquake are safe and accounted for,” Harper said in a statement Saturday.

Foreign Affairs says it’s aware of 388 Canadians in Nepal, but spokeswoman Diana Khaddaj said that figure is only an estimate as registration is voluntary.

Kali Pokhrel -- Nepal’s ambassador to Canada -- described the earthquake as the worst natural disaster the country has seen in decades.

“This is something we have not experienced in our lifetime,” Pokhrel said, who added falling debris killed one of his relatives.

The earthquake destroyed to a number of heritage sites, including the Dharahara tower, which was built in 1832.

“It’s a great loss for Nepal and Nepal’s identity,” Pokhrel said.

We mourn w/ the people of Nepal & India in the aftermath of this terrible disaster & offer our help & our prayers. http://t.co/kJ1fZ4AScY — Stephen Harper (@pmharper) April 25, 2015

A World Vision Canada worker from Toronto attending a conference in Nepal found herself unexpectedly caught in the earthquake.

Reena Vohra, a World Vision child protection specialist, said she had “never experienced anything like this.”

She was visiting a town close to Kathmandu with colleagues when the ground began to shake and they ran for cover.

“Buildings were crumbling all around us,” Vohra said. “When it felt safe, we ran to an open space where we were able to see the devastation of the ancient pagodas and temples that we had literally just visited an hour before.”

As fears grew of a humanitarian disaster in the impoverished Himalayan nation of 28 million, the Nepalese government has appealed for foreign help.

Canadian charities have begun fundraising to deal with the aftermath.

World Vision Canada spokesman Bob Neufeld said their teams have hit the ground in Nepal and are “assessing the situation.”

“The most immediate needs are food and non-food supplies, such as potable water, shelter kits and basic household supplies,” he said.

Rahul Singh of GlobalMedic -- a Canadian disaster response charity -- said it too has sent a team from India to Nepal, with a team from Canada on its way over the weekend.

“It’s a very big earthquake,” Singh said. “We need the public support.”

Harper offered his condolences to the Nepalese and Indian people.

“We mourn with the people of Nepal and India in the aftermath of this terrible natural disaster and offer our help and our prayers.”
