PETALING JAYA: Concerned Malaysians who wish to donate to the earthquake victims in Nepal can do so via the Nepal Earthquake Relief Mission.

Special Envoy to India and South Asia on Infrastructure Datuk Seri S. Samy Vellu said he was deeply shocked by the catastrophe which struck Nepal on Saturday.

“I could not sleep well, knowing that thousands have died in the earthquake,” he said at the launch of the mission.

Samy Vellu has teamed up with Hot Media Sdn Bhd, Team Force Security Sdn Bhd and All Malaysia Malayalee Association for a humanitarian effort to collect necessary items to be flown to Kathmandu this Sunday.

He said his office had embarked on several infrastructure projects in Nepal before the earthquake but the priority now was to assist the Nepali government in its rebuilding efforts.

“However, the first step is to ease the burden of the earthquake victims by providing them with daily necessities such as blankets, medicine, drinking water, dry food, clothes and tents,” he said.

Samy Vellu said he had contacted Defence Minister Datuk Seri Hishammuddin Hussein to provide a jet to deliver the donated items to Nepal.

The donation centre is at Hot Media Sdn Bhd, A-3-1, Tropicana Merchant Square, Jalan Tropicana Selatan 1, Petaling Jaya (open daily from 9am to 7pm).

For enquiries, call 03-7885 0408 or 016-339 7731.
