Dubai: Dr Abdulkhaleq Abdulla, the Emirati political science professor, who survived an earthquake-triggered avalanche, at the Everest Base Camp on Saturday, told Gulf News he remains positive while waiting for rescue.

“I am currently stuck in Namche with four other friends, two American, a British and the Nepalese guide,” said Dr Abdulla, one of the lucky trekkers to survive the avalanche, which was responsible for the deaths of at least 22 people.

“We just felt a tremor. This happens now and then so safety is still an issue.”

The professor said there is a warning to stay alert for another possible earthquake. On Tuesday, Dr Abdullah was still in Namche.

Still stuck in Namche deep in Himalayas. Weather is not helping foggy, cloud and cold. Yet safe, enough food and connected. Thanks God— Abdulkhaleq Abdulla (@Abdulkhaleq_UAE) April 28, 2015

In case of another earthquake, Dr Abdulla who is staying at a hotel in Namche must immediately evacuate and go to a nearby potato field until the tremors subside.

“I know the UAE embassy is trying very hard to arrange for a helicopter ride to Kathmandu. They are short in supply because of the abnormal situation. Meanwhile, we are taken care off. We have good food and electricity, so in many ways we are in good hands and very fortunate,” he told Gulf News

Dr Abdulla said he is ready to leave the area and awaits the arrival of the rescue team. He said he is in good health and in a positive frame of mind.

He also said that his team went out and saw first hand the damage caused by the earthquake, which fortunately did not cause much destruction in their area.

The tragedy comes barely a year after the death of 16 Sherpa guides in an avalanche.

Dr Abdulla told Gulf News earlier that he had to run for his life after the earthquake-triggered avalanche started towards the end of his trekking on Saturday.

He said the avalanche lasted for 20 minutes and after the first earthquake, there were aftershocks every 15 minutes for some four hours.
