</headline>

<text>
Situation overview:

The April 25th earthquake and subsequent aftershocks that struck Nepal have resulted in 7,365 deaths and left approximately 14,300 people with injuries. More than fifty percent of the country’s 79 districts are affected. Gorkha and Sindhupalchok districts each report that only ten percent of buildings are undamaged (LCT 02/05/2015). The district hospitals in Bidur, Chautara, Dhunche and Ramechhap are damaged and need long-term support (WHO 03/05/2015).

Medical resource needs:

•With hospitals operating beyond capacity, medical tents are required in all affected areas (WHO 03/05/2015).

•Medical professionals also note a limited availability of rehabilitation services, the need for psychosocial support, long waits for surgeries, and an acute need for surgical equipment and supplies (WHO 03/05/2015).

•Moreover, there are reports from Gorkha and Sindhuli districts of influenza and diarrheal cases (OCHA 02/05/2015).
