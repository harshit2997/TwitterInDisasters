A WOMAN who lost her mother in the Nepal earthquake is preparing to fly to the scene of the disaster to be reunited with her father and other loved ones.

Coleg Cambria Deeside hairdressing student Maya Shyangba Hyolmo, 30, was left devastated after learning her mother, Jangmu Sherpa, was among the thousands killed by the quake a few kilometres north east of the capital Kathmandu, which measured 7.9 on the Richter scale, destroying homes and ravaging villages.

As well as being reunited with family members so they can grieve together, Maya is desperate to help the villagers of Sarka Thali Helambu to rebuild their lives. She managed to speak to her father, Kaji Lama, briefly but soon lost contact when phones stopped working.

Maya, who lives with husband Michael in Hoole, Chester, said her father broke down crying as he told how he fled barefoot to safety, heartbreakingly believing his wife had also escaped. Jangu was found dead the day after the quake following hours of searching by loved ones.

Maya’s siblings, who live in Dubai and India, have also made efforts to reach their father.

After the earthquake their relatives had to survive without food or shelter on the side of the mountain.

Maya, who also works at Jason Lea Hairdressing in Bridge Street, Chester, will fly to be with her father and her uncle on Wednesday.

Efforts are being made to subsequently bring him to England so he can recover before returning home to Nepal. Former Hoole Liberal Democrat councillor Robert Thompson hopes to arrange Maya’s father’s flight to England through the British Embassy. He said: “The family are devastated by these awful tragic circumstances.”

Meanwhile, Samantha Jones, of Flint, who studies hairdressing with Maya in Connah's Quay, is organising a sponsored walk up Moel Famau in North Wales for Community Action Nepal to help those affected by the disaster.

Maya will also take part in the walk. More than 30 have already signed up for the event’s Facebook page and Maya says she has been overwhelmed by the kindness shown. To sponsor the event visit her www.justgiving.com/samantha-jones52/?utm_source, or to join, search Nepal Walk on Facebook.
