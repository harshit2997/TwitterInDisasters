Reports received so far by the government and aid groups suggest that many communities perched on mountainsides are devastated or struggling to cope.

(Bishwo Ghimire/World Vision via AP)LONDON — Emergency aid flights are landing Monday in earthquake-ravaged Nepal to try to locate and rescue victims as governments and agencies promise more help.

The Asian Development Bank announced a $3 million grant to Nepal on Monday to help provide desperately needed tents, medicine, food and water. It also said an additional $200 million will be made available for rehabilitation projects needed to help rebuild the Himalayan country.

Spain's government planned to send a chartered jet to Nepal loaded with tons of donated aid from the government and charities, including material to build water storage distribution points and latrines, tarps for shelters plus blankets and cooking sets for more than 500 families.

Mariona Minet of Spain's Oxfam Intermon said many people are still frightened and sleeping on the streets.

"Right now, the main needs are rescuing people and supplying those affected with food, water and shelter," she said.

"The government has asked them not to go back to their homes because there have been 65 aftershocks since the earthquake. Electricity and water are cut off, so supplying potable water is urgent."

A British Royal Air Force plane loaded with aid was also expected to arrive in Nepal on Monday. British volunteers are already helping with search-and-rescue operations.

The Israeli military said three aid-filled planes have already left for Nepal and three more departures are planned in the near future.

Plans call for the military to set up a field hospital to perform lifesaving medical procedures as quickly as possible and also to try to locate aid survivors who are still trapped.

Many charitable organizations also sent in material by air, including U.S.-based MAP International, which is airlifting antibiotics, wound care equipment and emergency health kits to provide care for 10,000 people for up to three months.
