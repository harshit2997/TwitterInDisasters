Everest film raises money for Nepal
</headline>

<text>
A Whanganui Film Society event raised $1000 for the victims of last month's devastating earthquake in Nepal.

The film society's screening of Beyond The Edge - a New Zealand film about Edmund Hillary's trek up Mt Everest - on Monday coincidentally fell just a couple of weeks after the magnitude 7.8 quake in Nepal, which has so far killed more than 7500 people.

Film society president Helen Marie O'Connell said it would have "felt wrong" to watch a film set in the area near the earthquake without trying to do something to help those affected.

Normally limited to members only, this screening was opened to the public by donation. Nearly 100 people attended the screening.

"The response from the audience showed that many others in Wanganui felt the same way, with some very generous contributions from members and non-members alike, and even an online donation from a couple who had seen the film already but still wanted to support the cause.

"Members didn't have to donate yet they did, and about half the audience were non-members so that was definitely worthwhile to open it up despite the short notice," Miss O'Connell said.

She said the money was donated to the New Zealand branch of Oxfam, an international development organisation with a base in India from which aid and supplies are being trucked into villages in the remote Gorkha region.

Miss O'Connell said she would like to acknowledge Rialto Distribution and the film's producers for allowing the screening to be opened up to the public for donations.
