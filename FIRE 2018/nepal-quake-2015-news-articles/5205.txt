Kentucky Woman Leaves Nepal Just Half An Hour Before Earthquake - LEX18.com | Continuous News and StormTracker Weather

The death toll in Nepal is nearing 8,000, with more than 10,000 injuries following the massive earthquake two weeks ago. Still, it may be months before the total impact of the seven point eight magnitude quake is known. It was a close call for one Kentucky woman who left Nepal half an hour before the eathquake struck.

"Our flight left at what was 11:26 AM their time. We had no idea that the earthquake hit 30 minutes after we had taken off," Maggie Bristoe told a reporter. "We waved and said goodbye and had no idea for hours, we made a dozen friends over there, close friends and we've heard from about 5 of them now."





After spending two weeks traveling the country, she is at a loss for words. Some of the hardest hit areas were located within the mountains exactly where Bristoe and her cousin were staying just hours before.





Bristoe has been in touch with one of her Nepali friends. She says they desperately need supplies. More than one million people are desperate for food. Hospitals, running short on supplies.





"They need a lot of financial support just to have shelter because they have to bring everything in because they are surrounded by mountains and a desert," says Bristoe.







Organizations such as the Red Cross are taking donations.
