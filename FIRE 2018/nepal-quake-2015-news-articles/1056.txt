In between that, when we go out, we’ve been experiencing (seen) more than 100 shops that has been affected and people are in a state of ‘what to do and what not to do.’ The mostly affected place was Kathmandu valley, the capital city. The government has declared, 26 cities as major affected areas. the major destruction that has happen is on to the historic monuments that we have. Kathmandu, Vasudhur and Patan, these three cities with historic monuments have been massively destroyed. On the other part, people are having lack on the daily supplies.
