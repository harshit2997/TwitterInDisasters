Southern Miss students gather Thursday night to remember the victims of last Saturday's earthquake in Nepal.

Many people in the University of Southern Mississippi international student community gathered Thursday night to pray for the victims of the devastating earthquake in Nepal.

They lit candles near the center of campus in Hattiesburg to remember those who died and were injured when that 7.8 magnitude quake hit last Saturday.

The death toll stands at more than 6,100.

"They are in a very painful and dreadful situation, so for that, we are supporting emotionally and psychologically the people of Nepal," said Pradip Bastola, a graduate student in chemistry and a native of Nepal.

On Thursday, two people were rescued from the rubble of buildings in Kathmandu. One victim was a woman.

The other was a 15-year-old boy.
