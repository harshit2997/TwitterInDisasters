The earthquake in Nepal hit home for some northern Michigan residents and local church members are now trying to help out the people affected.

The earthquake in Nepal hit home for some northern Michigan residents.

Members at Resurrection Life Church in Cadillac are now hoping to help out the people that were affected.

The church sent nine members on a mission trip to Nepal in 2013 to work with children at an orphanage.

Church member Rich Bennett has been emailing his friend in Nepal who said destruction can be seen everywhere.

Many people are sleeping outside in tents because they've been told not go in homes or buildings.

Bennett said even on Tuesday morning, Nepal was still experiencing tremors.

Resurrection Life Church has a mission team scheduled to go to Nepal in November, but Bennett said the date might get pushed up so the group can be there to help the people recovering from the earthquake.

"God calls us to go amongst the people and spread the good news and help your fellow brother and sister,â?? said Rich Bennett, a member at Resurrection Life Church. â??We form these walls and we form these boundaries, and this is a good opportunity for us to outstretch those and go beyond what we know as normal or our own area of safety, so this is really an opportunity to go help your fellow brother and sister."

Resurrection Life Church is collecting monetary donations for the people in Nepal and will be sending that over with the mission team.

The Diocese of Gaylord has been in touch with Catholic Relief Services and is also collecting money for the victims of the earthquake.

If youâ??d like to send money to Resurrection Life Church, you can do so here.

Donors looking to send money to the Diocese of Gaylord should mark their checks for Nepal Relief. All funds collected should then be sent Kim Smith, Finance Officer, at the Diocesan Pastoral Center in Gaylord at 611 W North St, Gaylord, MI 49735.

Donations may also be made on the diocesan website. Please be sure to note the donation is for Nepal Relief.

Individuals who would like to donate directly to Catholic Relief Services may also do so online here or by calling 877-435-7277.
