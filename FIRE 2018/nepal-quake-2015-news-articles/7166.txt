A Hoole woman from Nepal whose family was torn apart by last month’s devastating earthquake will fly home to the country after friends and classmates rallied together to buy her plane ticket.

Maya Shyangba Hyolmo, 30, was left heartbroken after hearing her mum Jangmu Sherpa had been one of more than 7,000 people killed in the 7.9 magnitude disaster.

Luckily her dad Kaji Lama and several other family members managed to escape unharmed, but were left homeless and forced to sleep outside with no clean clothes, food or water.

Maya, who is originally from a village called Sarka Thali Helambu, a few kilometres north east of Nepal’s capital Kathmandu, saw how badly the area had been destroyed and vowed to return home to be with her family and help get them back on their feet.

A campaign was launched by her friends and peers at Coleg Cambria in Connah's Quay, Deeside, to raise money to pay for her flights, but this was stepped up after Maya received news that her father, Kaji Lama, had taken ill.

A total of £346 was donated to the fund and she is due to fly out on Wednesday, May 13.

The hairdressing student has also bought clothes to take back to her village to give to her family and other survivors, and intends to buy more once she is over there.

Maya thanked all those who donated towards her flights on Facebook.

She posted: “Finally booked the ticket to Nepal. Flying back home on Wednesday. I’m coming to see you dad. I know mum won’t be there when I arrive home, which will break my heart but don’t worry dad, I’ll be strong for you and all my sisters and brothers. Xxx.”She added: “Thank you so much everyone. “I will do my best for my family and the village.”

Classmate Samantha Jones will continue the fundraising drive by hosting a walk up Moel Famau on June 7 for Community Action Nepal to help those like Maya’s dad who have been affected by the disaster.
