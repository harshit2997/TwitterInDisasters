T3 terminal building of Beijing Capital International Airport saw over 30 Chinese tourists coming back from the earthquake stricken areas in Nepal at 2:28 a.m. on April 27, 2015. People witnessed many touching moments.

These people belonged to a group of Haitai Travel Agency and were trapped in the earthquake stricken areas in Nepal. When they arrived at the airport in Nepal, many volunteers of Air China were waiting for them holding notice boards in hands. And other helpless foreign tourists admiringly looked at them.

These stranded people felt proud and contented especially when the volunteers sent sniff dogs and relief goods to Nepal with other rescuers, and brought them back without a stop. At that moment, they wanted to say: "The world is so big, but I love China best!"
