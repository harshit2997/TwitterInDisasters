As high-intensity earthquake shook Nepal, many panic-stricken tourists from Hyderabad stranded in Kathmandu are waiting for help. A group of 23 Hyderabadis are waiting to return to the city and reunite with their families, but there’s no help coming their way.

“I have contacted local revenue authorities and tourism officials as well, but no one has given any clarity on whom to approach for help here,” says Gowri Shankar, travel agency manager accompanying the group of 23 tourists from Malkajgiri.

They started from city on April 16. After visiting Kasi, they went to Kathmandu. Along with the tourists, four employees of the travel agency, including the manager, went to Nepal on a pilgrimage.

Among those who are stranded in Nepal, fifteen are women and most of them are senior citizens.

“At around 11.40 a.m., tremors were felt. Realising that it was an earthquake, we ran out of the building we were staying in,” one of the tourists told The Hindu over phone. The building that they were residing in came crumbling down soon after they rushed out. They assembled outside the building and saw that the whole street was crowded with people. As they took along a cook and necessary groceries for preparing food, they did not have to starve until the help came. In fact, they arranged for food for others on the street.

“We are scared to stay here. No one is assisting us on what to do. We don’t know whether to stay here or resume our journey,” they said. As roads are severely damaged, they are not ready to travel as yet.

Tourists from Secunderabad safe



Another group of tourists from Warasiguda in Secunderabad is also stranded in Nepal. But no one has been hurt. They informed their family members here that they were safe.

“We were worried for some time as we couldn’t contact our relatives in Nepal. They are planning to fly back to Hyderabad on Sunday,” said Ashok, a relative of one of the tourists.
