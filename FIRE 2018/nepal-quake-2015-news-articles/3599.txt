Pinoys urged: Bring 'bayanihan' to Nepal

MANILA - Different international organizations that rallied behind the Philippines in the aftermath of Yolanda are now appealing to Filipinos to bring their “bayanihan” spirit to Nepal.

In an interview with ANC, United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) country representative Bernard Kerblat said: “Can we mobilize ourselves in order to make sure that the bayanihan spirit of this country become globalized?”

He said the amount of money that can buy two cups of coffee is already equivalent to a blanket, needed by an individual in Nepal who has to stay outside after the strong earthquake on Saturday.

He said a one-way ticket to Baguio is already equivalent to a plastic sheet that can be used by five to six individuals.

“Despite the relief efforts, in the weeks to come, there will be countless children who will die because of hypothermia,” he said. He said it’s already spring time in Nepal, but the night still brings the cold.

Kerblat also thanked the Philippine government for rushing to the aid of Nepal. He said officials of the National Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Council, led by its chief Alexander Pama, are now meeting to come up with ways by which to help Nepal.

He said Nepal is a land-locked area, which makes the logistics of relief more complex. This is unlike during the Yolanda, where aide came via air, land, and sea, he said.

Save the Children Philippines, which also came to the aide of the Philippines during the Yolanda disaster, is also appealing for cash to help save lives in Nepal.

“Save the Children Philippines is launching an emergency fundraising appeal for the families and children affected by the earthquake in Nepal. We have essential equipment ready to be loaded on a plane and we have sent staff to support the emergency effort. Knowing the effect of emergencies, here in the Philippines, we are standing with the Nepalese people during their time of tragedy and distress and will do everything in our power to help,” said Save the Philippines country director Ned Olney.

Several organizations, including the Philippine National Red Cross, have also appealed for help.

“No amount is too small,” Kerblat said.
