The Korea Times and Radio Seoul are collecting donations for Nepal victims

A 7.8-magnitude earthquake that shook Nepal near its capital of Kathmandu Saturday has left roughly 4,000 dead and 6.6 million people affected.

The country’s biggest earthquake in 80 has proved devastating — countless people are out of homes, food, shelter and medical attention.

The Korea Times and Radio Seoul have joined hands with the American Red Cross to gather the Korean American community in bringing relief to the affected.

To help, make out donations to the American Red Cross with the memo “Nepal Earthquake Relief” to the Korea Times at 4525 Wilshire Blvd. Los Angeles, CA 90010.

For more information on how to help, call 323-692-2020.
