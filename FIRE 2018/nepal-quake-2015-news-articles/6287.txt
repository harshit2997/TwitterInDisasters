</headline>

Taipei, May 13 (CNA) President Chain Store Corp. (統一超商), which operates the 7-Eleven convenience store chain in Taiwan, said Wednesday that it had collected about NT$10.6 million (US$346,000) in donations, in a collaborative effort with World Vision Taiwan, to provide aid to earthquake-stricken Nepal.



The company said it has seen an outpouring of charity by the Taiwan public since it began collecting donations via the ibon electronic kiosks at its 7-Eleven stores on April 26.



In the first week, about NT$7.86 million was collected, with single day record of NT$1.5 million, and by May 13, the amount had reached NT$10.6 million, the company said.



It said the amount to date was 10 times more than had ever been obtained in its previous disaster relief campaigns, which was an indication that the Nepal quake catastrophe had struck a nerve among people in Taiwan.



Taipei City residents led effort with the highest total donations, followed by New Taipei and Taichung citizens, the company said, adding that more than 10 percent of the donations were made late at night or in early hours of the morning.



The ibon kiosk donation drive will be extended until the end of May, the company said.



Meanwhile, as of May 12, World Vision Taiwan had collected about NT$82.9 million in donations for aid to Nepal.



The Christian charity said it has set a goal of providing NT$100 million in aid to Nepal over the long term for rehabilitation and reconstruction.



However, the priority right now is to provide supplies to help victims of the devastating earthquakes weather the cold wet monsoon season, the charity said.



On April 25, Nepal was hit by a 7.8-magnitude earthquake that killed more than 8,000 people and left thousands more injured. On Tuesday, another strong quake struck the country, killing scores of people. (By Chen Cheng-wei and Ted Chen)
