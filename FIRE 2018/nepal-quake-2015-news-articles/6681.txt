South Canterbury men still in Nepal

Mytchall Bransgrove/Fairfax NZ Timaru police sergeant Geoff McCrostie was in Nepal trekking when the recent earthquake struck.

A Timaru woman is hoping the old adage that no news is good news holds true while waiting to hear from her husband who is in Nepal.

A magnitude 7.3 earthquake hit the capital Kathmandu and surrounding areas around 7pm Tuesday.

This is the second powerful earthquake to have rocked the Himalayan country in three weeks after a magnitude 7.8 earthquake on April 25 which killed thousands.

At least 66 people are believed to be dead after the new earthquake, and already weakened buildings have been destroyed.

South Canterbury police officers Sergeant Geoff McCrostie and Constable Joe Rush are on a tramping holiday with Wanaka man Grant Gillespie.

Karen McCrostie said none of the wives had heard from their husbands yet.

But she thought if anything had happened the families would have heard by now.

Karen expected she would be in contact with her husband by the end of the day.

The quake was centred 76 km east of the capital in a hilly area close to the border with Tibet, according to co-ordinates provided by the US Geological Survey, and unleashed landslides in Himalayan valleys near Mount Everest.

The group was supposed to be in that approximate area, she said.

The trio had decided to stay on after the first earthquake and were due back next Thursday, Karen said.

"I have earned a lot of brownie points with this trip."

The men are among 48 New Zealanders registered on the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade website www.safetravel.govt.nz.

An MFAT spokeswoman said the New Zealand High Commission in New Delhi was establishing whether any New Zealanders had been affected.

The ministry was advising against tourist and non-essential travel to Nepal.

The New Zealand High Commission in New Delhi and the Honorary Consul in Nepal are making enquiries to ascertain the extent of damage caused by the latest earthquake in Nepal and to establish whether any New Zealanders have been affected.

If you have concerns about a New Zealand citizen or family member in Nepal, attempt to make direct contact with them, MFAT advises. If you have ongoing concerns contact MFAT on 04 439 8000 (if calling from within New Zealand) or +64 4 439 8000 (if calling from outside New Zealand).
