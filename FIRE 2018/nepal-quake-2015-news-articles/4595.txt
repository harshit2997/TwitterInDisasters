PETALING JAYA: The Malaysian embassy in Kathmandu is working closely with Nepali authorities in finding and helping all Malaysian trekkers at the Himalayan range.

Embassy counsellor Fadli Adilah said the Nepali authorities have been forthcoming and have assisted several Malaysian trekkers from the region including those at the Annapurna, Langtang and Everest Range following the earthquake that rocked the country on Saturday.

“We have been liaising with the respective authorities to ultimately find, save and help all Malaysian missing or stranded trekkers.

“Please continue to pray and hope for the best for all Malaysians in Nepal at present and stay positive despite this understandably stressful time,” he said in a statement posted on the embassy’s Facebook page yesterday.

He said all trekkers in Nepal, regardless of their nationality, must be registered and licensed by the respective Nepali authorities and must be led by guides from the designated local trekking agencies.

“In any case of missing, stranded or injured trekkers, the agencies will be the first party to request for help from the authorities,” Fadli said.

He said on a normal day of trekking, an evacuation by medic-helicopter service will cost around US$5,000 (RM17,800).

“Currently, the Nepali authorities are prohibiting any private arrangements for such evacuations, especially if the trekkers are only stranded and still relatively safe.

“This is because the Nepali autho­rities, with the assistance of Indian and Chinese authorities, are optimising the usage of all aircraft for more urgent causes,” he said.
