A group of 10 persons from the State, including from Mangaluru, are struck in a place called Thame in Nepal. They are reported to be safe.

IT professional Naren Koduvattat is one of those from the city who is in Thame. He contacted Ganesh Karnik, MLC, on Monday. Mr. Karnik told The Hindu that they were in a hotel called Yeti Mountain Home and were safe.

“They have water to drink and a place to stay. They are safe and have suffered no injuries,” he said. There is a helipad next to the hotel. The nearest airport to Thame is at Lukla, which is about 140 km away from Kathmandu.

Mr. Karnik said that as road network had been cut, they would have to be shifted with a helicopter. He said that in evacuation and rehabilitation, the priority was being given to the injured and those who were still under debris. Shortage of helicopters had led to delay in picking them up.

When one of his friends from the city contacted Mr. Koduvattat over WhatsApp, he said they were waiting to fly to Kathmandu. No helicopter picked them up till late evening on Monday.

His friend said that he could not contact him over phone but could send and receive messages on WhatsApp for sometime during the day.

Donation collected

Students from Nepal studying in M.V. Shetty College of Physiotherapy and Nursing in the city collected funds at the City Centre Mall on Monday evening for victims of Nepal earthquake. A student said that about 20 persons donated. “We are yet to count the money,” he said. Students from north-east India also collected funds for Nepal on various roads in the city.

Special puja

A special puja was performed on Monday at Kadri Manjunatha temple, an endowment temple, praying for the safety of people in Nepal.
