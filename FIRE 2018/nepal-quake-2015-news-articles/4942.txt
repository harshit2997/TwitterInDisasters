Two Indian-origin billionaires in the UK have offered to build 1,200 quake-resistant houses in the affected villages of the country. Mukesh Kumar Sehgal, managing director of UK-based SISMO Company offered 1,000 quake-resistant houses, while, Prakash Lohia, founder and chairman of Indorama Corporation offered to build 200 houses through his Lohia Foundation.



Sehgal met Nepal’s Acting Ambassador to Britain, Tej Bahadur Chettri, on Friday and offered to build 1,000 quake-resistant houses in Nepal, Ekantipur reported.



“Our company is well experienced in building houses with new technology and if Nepal government accepts the offer, he will start construction of houses in remote areas that are severely hit,” Sehgal told PTI.



“Initially we will construct temporary houses so that affected people can be relocated. Later once debris is cleared, we will build the new settlement,” Sehgal said.
