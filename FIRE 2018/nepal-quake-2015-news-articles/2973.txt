President sends condolences following tragic earthquake in Nepal

28-April-2015

President James Michel has extended his most sincere condolences to the people and government of the Federal Democratic Republic of Nepal following the devastating earthquake which has claimed over 1900 lives and destroyed significant parts of the nation’s capital city of Katmandu.



In a message addressed to the Nepalese head of state, President Ram Baran Yadav, President Michel said the people of Seychelles grieve with Nepal in these darkest of moments and that Nepal can count on the solidarity and prayers of the people and government of Seychelles.



“It is with profound sorrow that we have learnt of this catastrophe which has resulted in the loss of countless lives and widespread destruction of property,” said President Michel.



The President added that the legendary resilience and courage of the Nepalese people would help them surmount this catastrophe of epic proportions.



He further noted that Seychelles is also doubly affected by this tragedy, considering the Nepalese community currently residing in Seychelles.



Meanwhile Home Affairs Minister Charles Bastienne on Sunday went to several bases on Mahé where the Nepalese security officers are working to personally express his sympathy to them following the earthquake.



“On behalf of the government and as home affairs minister, I sincerely express our heartfelt condolences to you all, especially those who have been directly affected by this tragic event,” said Minister Bastienne



All the ghurkas working in Seychelles have been able to contact their families in Nepal.

The minister explained that the necessary arrangements are being made so that those who have lost their loved ones during this disaster can fly to their homeland.



The minister went to the Montagne Posée prison and the ex-Coast Guard base at Bois de Rose, where the majority of the Nepalese are based.



In all there are 145 Nepalese officers working for the prison service and police department and the majority of them have not been directly affected by this disaster.
