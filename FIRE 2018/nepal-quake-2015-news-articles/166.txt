More than four hundred people have reportedly died after a 7.9 magnitude earthquake hit Nepal, the tiny Himalayan country, which is the gateway to Mount Everest. The quake struck Saturday morning 50 miles west of Kathmandu in an area between the capital and the town of Pokhara. Its aftershocks were felt across cities in northen India.

The quake has wreaked havoc in Kathmandu, reducing notable heritage structures and other buildings in the capital to rubble. The city’s Durbar Square, a plaza where coronations of the former kingdom used to take place and which is now a UNESCO World Heritage Site, has been extensively damaged. So has the Dharahara Tower, a popular tourist attraction, which is similar to India’s Qutab Minar. Kathmandu's airport has been closed.

Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi who tweeted about the earthquake shortly after it occurred, said: "We are working to reach out to those affected, both at home and in Nepal." Deaths have been reported in Bihar, in eastern India and damage in areas of Uttar Pradesh and West Bengal. India’s federal ministry of external affairs has opened a 24-hour control room to monitor the aftermath of the earthquake. Residents of Gurgaon, a township of glitzy condos and malls have reported that some of their towers were "swaying." Indian billionaire Ajay Piramal's wife Swati posted on Facebook that she felt the ripples even in Mumbai.

While telecom towers in Kathmandu are believed to have been hit making communication difficult, I was miraculously able to reach Binod Chaudhary, the country’s sole billionaire, on his cellphone. ‘The death toll could run into several hundreds, “ said Chaudhary in a brief conversation. The billionaire, along with two of his sons, was touring Chitwan, an area famous for its national park and jungles, where his Chaudhary Group is building a resort in partnership with India’s Taj Hotel chain.

He said it was unlikely that they could return to Kathmandu anytime soon since the roads and highways are damaged with huge cracks in them. “ It’s most unfortunate but Nepal just doesn’t have the capacity to handle such major calamities. “
