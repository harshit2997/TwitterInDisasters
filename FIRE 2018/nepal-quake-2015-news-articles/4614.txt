Food for 3.5 million people, 400,000 tents needed. Quake toll nears 7,000, fresh tremors rock Himalayan nation.Fresh tremors rocked parts of Nepal on Saturday, triggering landslides as the death toll in last Saturday's earthquake neared 7,000 and protests mounted over relief not reaching several affected areas.A 5.1-magnitude aftershock shook Barpak village in Gorkha district near the epicentre of the powerful 7.9-magnitude temblor that had caused widespread destruction. The second aftershock also led to landslides, adding to the woes of the quake-hit people, many of whom have been forced to stay in the open.Angry people took to the streets alleging the relief material was finding its way to the black market and prices of essential items had also been steeply hiked. Many areas of the Kathmandu Valley are still deprived of necessary food items, which compelled people to resort to sloganeering against the authorities.The number of Indians who died in the earthquake are 48 with 10 reported injured brought to various hospitals, according to information released by Nepal's Home Ministry on Saturday.Aid and assistance in both cash and kind is pouring in but due to the difficult geographical terrain, it has been a challenge to carry out rescue and distribution of relief materials.Officials said there was just one water filter received from outside. The government still needs 400,000 tents, said the home ministry.People are afraid to return home fearing quakes. Over 150 aftershocks have jolted the nation within this one week. Over 6 lakh people have left Kathmandu. Archaeologists said it will take a decade to restore damaged monuments in Kathmandu.The Nepal government has created a fund of $2 billion for reconstruction. International communities, including the UN, have called for assistance for Nepal. At least 29 nations are engaged with rescue and relief works with various aid related assistance. More than 3.5 million people are in need of food and over 8 million are directly affected by the quake.Bureaucracy at Kathmandu airport was holding up vital relief supplies, said UN Resident Representative Jamie McGoldrick. He said material was piling up at the airport instead of being ferried out. Finance Minister Ram Sharan Mahat said, "We have received things like tuna and mayonnaise. What good are those? We need grains, salt."
