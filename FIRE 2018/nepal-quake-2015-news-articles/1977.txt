Tons of International Aid Arrives in Nepal

The first countries to respond to Nepal's disastrous 7.9-magnitude earthquake were India, China, and Pakistan.

Much-needed aid began to arrive in Nepal Monday, after the country was hit by a massive earthquake over the weekend that left more than 4,000 dead, 7,500 injured and many more without food, water or shelter.

International rescue teams, equipped with heavy cutting gear and accompanied by sniffer dogs, began arriving in Nepal's capital Kathmandu, along with relief supplies.

The first nations to respond were India, China and Pakistan, who will also soon be joined by rescuers from the United States.

The European Commission also released 3 million euros (US$3.3 million) to fund clean water projects, medicine, emergency shelter and communications in Nepal's worst affected areas.

Tens of thousands of residents have been spending the night on the street in makeshift tents since Saturday's 7.9-magnitude quake, either because their homes were flattened or out of fear of further aftershocks.

Nepal's telecommunications system has also shut off in most of the country, making it hard to evaluate the full scale of the disaster.

Aftershocks continued to be felt Sunday and Monday, triggering avalanches on surrounding mountains, including the tourist-laden Mount Everest, contributing to the area's destruction.
