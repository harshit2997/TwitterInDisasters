As devastating news continues to emerge from Nepal in the wake of its 7.9 magnitude earthquake, it’s hard to comprehend what actually happened when the disaster struck. One man captured it on film.

A video has emerged from Mount Everest base camp, showing the terrifying moment an avalanche — triggered by the earthquake — pummelled the site.

German tourist Jost Kobusch was filming his surrounds when the earth began shaking.

After seeing people running from above him, and the wall of snow behind them, the 22-year-old traveller quickly dove into his tent as the avalanche rolled over.

Post continues after video:

As he and others emerged from the tent, the site is visible — entirely covered in snow.

Jost survived the ordeal and posted the video on YouTube. He wrote: “The ground was shaking from the earthquake and as soon as we saw people running we were running ourselves to save our lives.”

The death toll in the wake of the Nepal earthquake is around 2,500. Around 350 Australians remain unaccounted.
