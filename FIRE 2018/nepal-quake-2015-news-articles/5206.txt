Alice garage sale to aid Nepal quake victims

<text>
A WELL-KNOWN ABC radio couple who spent 2014 in Nepal are organising a community garage sale on Saturday to raise funds for the Nepal earthquake relief.

Alex and Rohan Barwick are hosting the garage sale appeal in a bid to give back to the Nepalese community in their time of need.

Ms Barwick said when the earthquake struck they, like many others, were very worried about friends and colleagues affected by the disaster.

She decided to hold the event to do something small to keep people thinking of the plight of Nepalese people.

“Often after something like this happens and a week later it’s out of the news cycle. So hopefully it just keeps people thinking about Nepal,” she said.

Ms Barwick she had been overwhelmed by the support of the Alice Springs community since advertising the event on social media last week.

What was going to be a small bake sale has grown to a full-blown community event.

“So many people have offered to bake cakes, help run a pop up tea shop, organise a lawn sale, donate prizes for a raffle,” she said.

Member of the Alice Springs Nepalese community Saroj Chhetri said they are behind the event 100 per cent.

“We want to thank Alex for organising this event and we Nepalese will do our best to make this event successful,” he said.

The Nepal Earthquake Fundraiser will be from 8am to noon at 2 Wallis St.

All funds raised will go to the International Nepal Fellowship to help Nepali people affected by the disaster.
