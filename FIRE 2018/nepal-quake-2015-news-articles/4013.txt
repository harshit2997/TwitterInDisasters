After a magnitude 7.8 earthquake hit one of the poorest nations on Earth, Nepal, on April 25 the country’s many survivors find themselves in desperate need of food and water.

The devastating earthquake and its aftershock on April 26 killed more than 5,000 people in the country’s Kathmandu Valley. More than eight million people have been affected by the quake, the UN said. About 10,000 people have been injured.

Now, aid has begun to reach those regions near the epicenter as many countries around the world have mobilized.

Azerbaijan is one of those countries which have joined the aid efforts. The Emergency Situations Ministry has sent humanitarian aid to Nepal on April 29.

The humanitarian aid was sent by Be-200 aircraft and included one ton of medicine, medical supplies, tents, blankets and packaged drinking water, noted the ministry.

The aid was prepared and sent in accordance with the order of President Ilham Aliyev.

Earlier, the Azerbaijani embassy in India was informed that some 14 Azerbaijani citizens are living in Nepal, including six children. One of the children was slightly injured during the quake. Doctors estimated his condition to be stable.

On the way back the plane will evacuate those Azerbaijani citizens in the disaster zone.
