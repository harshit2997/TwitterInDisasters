Lee Opp hasn't been getting much sleep the past few days. No one in her family has. She's worried about her daughter, Sandy, who went to Nepal last week to start a new teaching job. Days after Sandy arrived, the earthquake hit.

"It's been really tough," Opp said. "We haven't heard anything from her."

Sandy Desorgher and her husband Max left Cambodia on April 19, en route to Katmandu. Her job was to be with the Geneva Global School, a Green School Alliance affiliate.

Opp doesn't know where she planned to stay or go, and now is not sure how to find out. She has contacted the State Department, the BBC, several aid agencies and anyone who thinks they might be able to help.

"My biggest fear is that we never know what happened," she said.

Opp has been watching television news video of the destruction, and the burning and burying of bodies before they can be identified. She is concerned that Sandy could be among those.

"I want to know." Lee is not giving up hope, and never will, she said. She is hoping that the issue is just a communication problem.

Sandy, she says, has been teaching all over the world in the past decade.

"If anyone can get through this, is it Sandy," she said. "She's a tough lady and a survivor."

Lee is hoping that anyone who has contact with people in Katmandu might be able to help. She continues to try to contact the school, but so far, she says, no one is answering.
