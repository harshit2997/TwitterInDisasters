York fundraisers continue to support people of Nepal

FUNDRAISERS around our region are doing their part to help the people of Nepal.

A series of major earthquakes have struck the country in recent weeks, leaving more than eight thousand people dead and many more homeless, with entire villages completely destroyed.

In York, pupils at Heworth School took it upon themselves to get involved, and arranged a special event in support of those affected by the tragedy.

Molly Newton, music teacher at Heworth School, said: "Oliver Parker, one of the children in Year Three, thought we should try to raise some money for the earthquake victims in Nepal. He organised a non-uniform day last week which raised £264.

"Fellow class mate Kate Newton thought we could do more fundraising and so organised a cake sale after school in the playground. Lots of parents and children got baking and the local Costcutter helped out selling our cakes and biscuits.

"The sale was a big success and raised £153.08. That means that two eight-year-old children organised events that raised £417.08 between them in one day. It's particularly poignant for our school as two of our cleaning staff are from Nepal and have family there still."

Meanwhile, members of the York Military Wives Choir have urged people to donate goods at Hurst Hall, their local community centre, with goods expected to ship out shortly.

But Allison said the appeal had gone so well, they now need help storing donations.

Allison West said: "We have just had a rather large donation from the fire brigade, an articulated lorry full. Hurst Hall has limited space, the army camps are now overflowing and we are a little stuck.

"We are currently collecting aid for Nepal and due to the overwhelming response we are running out of space and means to transport and store everything that has been donated."

Anyone who can assist with storage or donations for the York Military Wives Choir should email york@militarywiveschoirs.org
