BANGKOK, 5 May 2015 â€“ The Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MFA) revealed that three more Thai nationals in Nepal have requested evacuation back to Thailand.

According to the MFA, a parent of three children has sought assistance from the ministry for their return to Thailand on C-130 aircraft.

The aircraft arrived in Nepal yesterday to deliver emergency supplies from Thailand and other items given by Her Royal Highness Princess Maha Chakri Sirindhorn.

With the three children expected to return soon, there will only be three more Thai citizens remaining at the Thai embassy in Kathmandu.

The rescue teams from the Royal Thai Armed Forces, combat medics and those from the Ministry of Public Health have been providing relief efforts to the quake survivors, as well as those affected by it.

Aid teams have found that quake victims are suffering from respiratory illnesses. The World Health Organization has praised the Thai government and their medical teams for helping people in the aftermath of the devastating quake.
