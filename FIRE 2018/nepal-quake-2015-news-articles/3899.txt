</headline>

<text>
Georgian citizens stuck in Nepal following the deadly earthquake which has killed more than 5,000 people, have been offered a way out of the devastated nation.

The Georgian Embassy to India, which is also accredited to Nepal, Thailand and Sri Lanka, will provide a service facilitating the return of Georgian citizens from Nepal to their homeland.

Any Georgian citizen who wished to be evacuated from the disaster zone is being urged to contact the Georgian Embassy by calling the hotline; +911147078602; +911149496000; +919560093233; +919560791004.

The hotline was established by the Embassy immediately after Saturday’s fatal earthquake.

The magnitude 7.8 earthquake devastated much of Nepal’s capital Kathmandu and triggered a deadly avalanche on nearby Mount Everest shortly after.

Latest information from the United Nations stated more than 5,500 people had been killed in the natural disaster and at least 11,000 more had been injured. In addition, the UN claimed more than eight million people had been affected by the earthquake and around 70,000 houses have been completely destroyed.

The Georgian Ambassador to India, who is also accredited to Thailand, Sri Lanka and Nepal, arrived at the disaster zone in Kathmandu on April 28 to experience the situation firsthand and meet with Georgian tourists and expatriates.

Official sources noted no Georgian citizens were among the victims of the catastrophe.

Ambassador Levan Nizharadze reported that a Georgian tourist group consisting of 12 people arrived in Kathmandu yesterday from the city of Pokhara. He said the group would soon return to Georgia on an Air Arabia flight.

While in Kathmandu the Georgian Ambassador has met with the Nepalese Foreign Office and Internal Affairs Ministry. He is due to return to India tomorrow.

The devastating earthquake struck near Nepal’s capital Kathmandu just before noon on Saturday.

A magnitude 6.6 aftershock hit about an hour later and smaller aftershocks continued to ripple through the region for hours.
