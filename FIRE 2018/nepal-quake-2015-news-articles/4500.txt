The parents of a Norfolk man who is travelling in the Nepalese region have spoken of their relief at hearing his voice following the devastating earthquake.

Ray and Josie Tuddenham from South Creake received a long-awaited telephone call from their son Lee on Monday morning, having not heard anything from him for over a week.

Mrs Tuddenham said the 33-year-old told them he was fine and had not been near the epicentre of the quake.

“It turns out he wasn’t in Nepal but in a place called Sikkim (an Indian state bordering Nepal to the east) but as we hadn’t heard anything and he had told us he was heading north for the mountains we were very worried,” she said.

“The last we had heard from him was on April 19 but as he didn’t have any phone signal or internet connection last week he hadn’t been able to get through to us. We breathed a sigh of relief when he did call.”

She said her son, a former Alderman Peel High School and Fakenham College student who studied for a doctorate at the University of East Anglia, was due to return home next month and did not expect him to cut short his trip. He had been working for the past five years in France as a cancer research scientist and saved his money to travel the world, she said.

“He went to South America last year and he is very sensible. He said he will stay away from large towns and cities where there are lots of buildings that might collapse. He did feel some of the tremors but it wasn’t too bad where he was.

“He can’t always ring or email so I will try not to worry too much while he is away.

“I am looking forward to seeing him when he does come home.”
