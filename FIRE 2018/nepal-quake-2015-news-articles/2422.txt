Indian doctors and nurses rush to earthquake-struck Nepal’s aid

The high intensity earthquake that hit Nepal on Saturday morning also affected several parts of North and North-East India.

Hospitals in Nepal are struggling to provide care to many patients who were rushed for surgery. Doctors and nurses are working non-stop and many patients are being treated out in the open due to lack of beds and space to accommodate the injured. Prime Minister of Nepal, Sushil Koirala has made a frantic appeal for blood donation. The Indian government has sent 1000 trained personnel of the National Disaster Response Force (NDRF) along with three Indian Army field hospitals (medical supplies and personnel) and civilian doctors. Defence Secretary R.K. Mathur said in Delhi, ‘We have rescued 141 people in the area and moved them to hospitals in Kathmandu.’

The Indian Air Force flew back 1,342 Indians from Nepal. It also took food packets, tents, medicines, blankets and medical teams to Nepal. The Indian Army said it has planned long-term rescue operations in Nepal called ‘Operation Maitri’ and the government is leaving no stone unturned in helping the affected country. The Uttar Pradesh government has also sent a team of doctors along with relief materials to Nepal. Most of the doctors are orthopaedic surgeons as a large number of the injured people have suffered fractures. The relief materials were sent on late Sunday in 21 trucks, of which 10 trucks were carrying biscuits and food material, 10 were carrying mineral water, and one with emergency medicines.
