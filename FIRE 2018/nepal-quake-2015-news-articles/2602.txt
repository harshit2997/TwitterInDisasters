Zachary Sheridan, brother of actor Hugh Sheridan, has contacted his family via social media to let them know he is safe and well.

Mr Sheridan posted on Facebook just before 3pm (AEST) to say he was safe and "really sorry for everyone affected".

"Communication has been down otherwise I would have obviously let you know earlier," he wrote.

A family member has confirmed with 9NEWS that he was found in Gorakshep in Nepal and had been on Gokyo at the time of the 7.9 magnitude earthquake.

The 20-year-old had been studying media and arts in Hong Kong when he decided to embark on the trip on his own.

He had been travelling with a local trekking tour company.

Brothers Tom and Hugh, best known for his role on Australian television series Packed to the Rafters, are en route to Nepal where the pair planned to hire a helicopter to search for his younger brother.

Earlier, Zachary's sister Zoe spoke on the TODAY show and said her family was confident her brother's last known location appeared to have been spared the worst of the damage.

"The contact there is so bad," she said.

"I feel really positive that he's ok. I'm sure he's fine, safe and warm."

One Australian, Melbourne mother-of-two Renu Fotedar, is confirmed to have died after she was caught in an avalanche at Mount Everest base camp.

More to come.
