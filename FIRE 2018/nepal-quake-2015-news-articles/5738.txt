BENGALURU:IAS officer Pankaj Kumar Pandey and IPS officer Umesh Kumar, who were deputed by the state government to ensure the safe evacuation of people from the state in quake-hit Nepal, returned to Bengaluru on Thursday.

Umesh Kumar told Express that all residents of the state have been evacuated safely from Nepal.

After the quake, about 500 people from the state had reached Varanasi by road and about 200 reached Delhi. The Indian Air Force also evacuated a few mountaineers from Mangaluru from the Everest base camp, he added.

“The helpline set up by the state government has not received any calls in the last 36 hours...However, our medical teams and civil defence will continue to help for some more time,” he said.

The official also explained in detail their stay in the Himalayan nation.

He said there was no power for three days and telephone lines were also down. Several ancient structures, including temples and schools, were reduced to rubble.

“We stayed in the house of a local (Nepalese) resident and tried contacting our people. Simultaneously, doctors and rescue teams from the state helped the victims,” he added.

Ritesh Kumar Singh, secretary, Disaster Management Cell, said the team members would have continued with their search operations had they received calls.

“Initially about 300 calls were registered and based on that a list was drawn. As and when our officers came in contact with state residents they were evacuated and those rescued were marked in the list,” Singh said.

HAL’s Dhruvs Help in Rescue Ops

The Advanced Light Helicopter Dhruv manufactured by Hindustan Aeronautics Limited (HAL) has been playing a major role in rescue operations in earthquake-hit Nepal, according to HAL officials.

“The Dhruvs have so far cumulatively completed nearly 40 sorties, clocking around 70 hours of flying. They are helping in the movement of equipment and logistics management, in addition to evacuating people from earthquake affected areas,” said HAL CMD T Suvarna Raju in a release on Thursday.

Prime Minister Narendra Modi had recently handed over an indigenous Dhruv to Nepal Prime Minister Sushil Koirala at Kathmandu, which is being used by the Nepalese Army. According to HAL officials, the Dhruv has a proven track record in both military and civil operations. It is useful in completing arduous tasks in difficult terrains.
