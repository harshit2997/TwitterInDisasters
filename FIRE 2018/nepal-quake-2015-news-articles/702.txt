"We are hearing rumours that other bigger earthquakes are expected to happen"

Death toll now more than 2,200, with scores injured

Strong aftershocks cause panic and further damage

New avalanche strikes Mt. Everest, where at least 17 died

Offers of help pour in from around the world

Death toll rises by the minute

Strong aftershocks continue to hit Nepal, with one measuring 6.7 on the Richter scale, causing further panic and devastation.

A new avalanche was also triggered near Mount Everest.

The number of dead continues to rise by the minute after Saturday’s 7.9 magnitude quake, amid frantic searches for survivors among the rubble.

The latest official death toll is now more than 2,200, but many remote areas close to the epicentre have still not been reached.

Hospitals and clinics are overwhelmed with the scores of people arriving with serious injuries.

Many buildings and landmarks destroyed

The strongest earthquake to hit Nepal in 80 years devastated the Kathmandu valley.

It caused many buildings and landmarks to collapse, and triggered a deadly avalanche on Mount Everest. At least 17 were killed at the base camp.

Local authorities are struggling to cope with the aftermath, with reports of many rescuers being forced to dig with their bare hands.

The historic Dharahara Tower in Nepal’s capital has been reduced to a stump. Built in 1832, what was a 14-storey structure is now unrecognisable.

Nepal’s worst earthquake in 1934 killed more than 8,500 people.

Fears of further strong quakes

Many residents have also been forced to spend the night on the streets, with so many homes destroyed.

In Kathmandu, residents bedded down in make-shift outdoor shelters.

Afraid to return home, people preferred to brave the freezing temperatures.

“We are hearing rumours that other bigger earthquakes are expected to happen. We are sleeping here, so we can stay safe and quickly run to safety if needed,” explained Rabindra Shresth, a local resident displaced by the earthquake.

An untold number of people have been injured.

With many people still trapped under rubble, there are fears the death toll will climb.

The quake also triggered an avalanche on Mount Everest, killing at least 18 people as it swept through a base camp for climbers.

Thirty-six fatalities were reported in India, which is now coordinating a disaster response to help neighbouring Nepal.

International offers of help for Nepal

Offers of help for Nepal are coming in from around the world.

Rescue teams in Los Angeles were preparing to leave for Kathmandu with specialist equipment.

It is a race against the clock to reach those who may still be alive beneath the rubble.

Los Angeles County Fire Department Chief John Tripp told reporters: “Our main mission – and we’re committed to this mission because we live in earthquake country – is that we find people in collapsed buildings and we try to rescue them, and then lend aid to them.”

Rescue teams from China have also left Beijing bound for Nepal.

They are taking specialist equipment, as well as sniffer dogs trained in finding survivors.

Checks for casualties and damage continue to be carried out in neighbouring countries, including China, India and Bangladesh, which also felt the quake and aftershocks.

India’s Foreign Minister, Subrahmanyam Jaishankar, said: “Once we have a damage assessment, which we hope to have done overnight, by tomorrow our endeavour would be to have five helicopters positioned in Kathmandu and five helicopters positioned in Pokhara.

“Their role would be to do the local rescue, to do airlifting if they have to and to do food distribution locally.”

The US is providing one million dollars in immediate assistance to Nepal, and China is also sending an emergency team.

International aid groups are rushing to reach victims in rural villages after communications were cut off by the quake.

Google has launched a People Finder search for those looking to check on loved ones.
