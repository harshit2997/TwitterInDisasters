Rescue teams on Monday deployed specially trained dogs from India, France and Spain for locating victims buried under tonnes of debris following the devastating earthquake in Nepal.

A team of 15 personnel and six dogs were brought in Nepal from France and Spain to assist in the rescue operations.

"These dogs have a vital role in identifying victims buried under the debris," said Jose Castello, a volunteer with Intervention Ayuda Emergencical.

Christophe Sira, Central Seismological Bureau member of Pompiers d'urgence, said that the breeds of dogs who arrived for the rescue operations are Golden Retriever and German Shepherd.

Prominent organisations like Red Cross International is among other groups assisting in the rescue operations.

Dogs were flown in well built cages so that they don't feel cramped during the journey.

India has sent a team of National Disaster Response Force. Dogs are also part of the entourage to help locate victims buried under the debris.

A state of emergency has been declared in Nepal after a powerful 7.9-magnitude earthquake struck the country on Saturday followed by numerous aftershocks. Over 3,600 people have been killed and nearly 7,000 others injured in the tragedy.
