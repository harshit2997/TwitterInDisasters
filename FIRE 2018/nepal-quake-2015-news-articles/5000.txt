Bozeman man home safe after surviving Nepal earthquake - KRTV News in Great Falls, Montana

A Bozeman man is safely back home after experiencing the earthquake in Nepal first hand.

Family and friends anxiously waited for Colton Stiffler at the Bozeman airport Saturday, seeing him for the first time since his trip to Nepal.

The photographer was on a personal trip, where he climbed to the base camp on Mount Everest.

He was about 100 miles away from the epicenter of the 7.8 magnitude earthquake that shocked the country last week, claiming thousands of lives.

Stiffler experienced delays flying out of Katmandu as aid workers were flying in and refugees flying out of the country.

He says it was still extremely sad when he left. “I witnessed multiple bodies being pulled out,” Colton Stiffler said. “It's just really sad to see people, native people that lost their homes now, ancient temples, five of the eight UNESCO world heritage sites are completely reduced to rubble right now. And they're still pulling bodies out.”
