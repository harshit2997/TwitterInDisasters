The Myanmar Red Cross Society (MRCS) is ready to send a team to Nepal to join in disaster relief efforts following a devastating earthquake that rocked the Himalayan nation on Saturday.

To date, more than 4,000 people have been counted as dead in the 7.9-magnitude earthquake which struck between the cities of Kathmandu and Pokhara at the weekend.

The MRCS’s Disaster Management Department Director Maung Maung Khin said five members had so far been appointed to the team heading to Nepal.

“As of now, we cannot say for sure how many members will be in the team, but we have already appointed five members who have had training in rescue services. Altogether, Red Cross teams from 11 Southeast Asian countries will be travelling to Nepal and their roles will be designated based on the needs on the ground, such as water and sanitation, health or rescue operations,” said Maung Maung Khin.

He said negotiations were currently taking place, and that once given the green light the Burmese team would be ready to depart within 24 hours.
