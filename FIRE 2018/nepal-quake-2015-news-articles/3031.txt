Four northeastern Louisiana residents are still stuck in Nepal following a magnitude-7.8 earthquake that struck the country Saturday.

Jan Quiet of Monroe, Rudy and Susan Miksa of Monroe and M. Douglas Walton of Ruston are part of a group of traveling artists, 11 Americans and four Canadians along with three Nepalese who were visiting the area as part of "Journey Encounter Nepal and Tibet."

"We have no updates at this time," Cole Avery, a spokesman for U.S. Rep. Ralph Abraham, R-Alto, said. "The State Department is aware of the group and their situation, and we're waiting to hear from them on any new information.

"Congressman Abraham is monitoring the situation and is hopeful for a positive outcome. The group remains in his thoughts and prayers."

Walton is the trip's organizer. His Ruston assistant Marlen Waters said there are Americans from Colorado, Texas, Florida and Louisiana on the trip.

"I was able to speak to him noon on Saturday, about 10 hours after the earthquake, and they were fine," Waters told The News-Star on Monday. "They had left Kathmandu and were on their way to Tibet, and the best I can tell, they were at the border and backed them up about five minutes from the border between Nepal and Tibet."

According to Waters, there has been an attempt to rescue them by helicopter, but poor visibility prevented the rescue.

"As far as I know, they've moved them to a flat area so they would be safe from rock slides," she said. "They are all safe and OK. They just don't have food, water or sanitation. It's just a matter of trying to extract them."
