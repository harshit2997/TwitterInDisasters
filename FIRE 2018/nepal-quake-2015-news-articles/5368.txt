Sex traffickers pose as social workers in Nepal, luring desperate female survivors to prostitution

The Nepal government has ended the search and rescue operations.

Following the massive earthquake that struck Nepal, many areas and people were left in the country devastated. Sex and human traffickers are reported as luring or kidnapping displaced women.



MUNTINLUPA, PHILIPPINES (Catholic Online) - According to aid organizations, members of criminal groups are taking advantage of Nepalese women by using relief items to subject them into illegal trades. These women are being shipped off to brothels across Asia, according to the Daily Mail.

"This is the time when the brokers go in the name of relief to kidnap or lure women," said Sunita Danuwar, director of the NGO Shakti Sumuha in Kathmandu.

Unfortunately, because of the difficulties and desperation those involved are facing after the massive earthquake, most people will take any chance they have for relief, according to health worker Rashmita Shashtra in an interview with The Guardian.

"There are spotters in the villages who convince family members and local brokers who do the deal. We know who they are," added Shashtra.

Meanwhile, international agencies and the government of Nepal are passing blame onto each other because of the confusion over slow relief and response operations after donations and aid poured into the country last week.

With frustrations over delays and the lack of coordination, an aide to Prime Minister Sushil Koirala explained that some donors are now directly sending their help to non-government organizations for distribution, bypassing the authorities.

Desperation forces people to make hasty choices, putting themselves into harm.

"There are differences between the government and some donors over this," said the aide.

"They can leave. If they are also specialists in clearing the rubble, they can stay," said Rameshwor Dangal, an official at Nepal's home ministry, in a statement with Reuters last Monday. The government has asked the international organizations to end their search and rescue operations.
