Kathmandu: At least 22 climbers have died and 217 others were missing near the base camp of Mt Everest where hundreds of climbers, including many foreigners, are stranded after an avalanche was triggered by the earthquake.

More than 60 climbers were injured and many foreign adventurers, hikers and guides at the base camp were feared missing when the avalanche buried a section of the mountaineering camp.

While 17 people were killed at the base camp, five more casualties were reported yesterday from areas below the base camp, Home Ministry officials said. “Tents have been blown away,” Gelu Sherpa, who was at the camp when disaster struck, said, adding, “There is a lot of confusion on the mountain.”

Thirty-two people have been rescued from the region till now. Suresh Acharya, joint secretary at the Tourism Ministry, said they were airlifted by five rescue helicopters. Twenty-two of the most seriously injured climbers were yesterday ferried by helicopters, including from the Indian Air Force, to Pheriche village, the nearest medical facility, though bad weather is hampering rescue and relief operations.

Another 54-year-old Indian attempting to climb all the highest peaks in the seven continents, is stuck at Camp II on Everest along with 11 other fellow climbers. Ankur Bahl, part of the Madison Group, had moved to Camp II from Camp I yesterday but is now stranded.

Tourism ministry officials estimate that at least 1,000 climbers, including about 400 foreigners, had been at the base camp when Nepal’s worst earthquake in 80 years on Saturday noon triggered the avalanche on Everest.
