First Australians evacuated from Kathmandu

The first Royal Australian Air Force flights evacuated Australians out of Kathmandu after delivering 15 tonnes of aid for the earthquake-hit nation, media reported on Friday.

More than 100 people, including 66 Australians - a mix of trekkers, tourists, and volunteer workers - were flown to Bangkok on two RAAF C-17 Globemaster transport planes, ABC reported.

But more Australian trekkers and tourists remain stranded, including many more in the trekking hub of Lukla, near Mount Everest.

Most of the evacuees had camped out at the Australian embassy since the quake struck Kathmandu Valley and neighbouring regions on April 25.

They were taken to the airport and ushered quickly onto the tarmac with the help of consular staff.

Australian ambassador Glenn White has been tasked with leading the effort to account for the hundreds of Australians who were in Nepal when the quake hit.

"We've located most Australians, or at least we think they're safe," he said.

The Globemasters had flown in to Kathmandu on Thursday carrying aid supplies, including bottled water, purification tablets, and tents and tarpaulins.
