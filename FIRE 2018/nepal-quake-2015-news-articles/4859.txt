Sections of the Indian media have been slammed for their 'insensitive' coverage of Nepal's devastating earthquake.

The hashtag #GoHomeIndianMedia is trending on social media, along with stories accusing Indian TV channels of gross misconduct.

Posts on Facebook and Twitter claim Indian journalists have been intruding on family cremations, berating grieving relatives with inappropriate questions and confronting security forces at the site of the devastation.

They've also been accused of broadcasting stories resembling "dramatic soap opera TV serials", and even using the disaster as a publicity platform for Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi.

India's media were among the first on the scene in Nepal, broadcasting images used around the world of a disaster that's so far claimed at least 7,200 lives.

It prompted a massive response from the Indian public, with schools and Bollywood all pitching in with relief efforts.

But the 24-hour news cycle has put pressure on channels to produce more stories. While many Nepalis are grateful for India's support and aid over the past week, they're also demanding Indian reporters leave Nepal as soon as possible.

The hashtag began trending on World Press Freedom Day, and has generated hundreds of thousands of tweets.
