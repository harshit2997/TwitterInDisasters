IT WILL be bittersweet when Narayan Pariyar makes the journey from Launceston to his hometown in Nepal for the first time in 11 years.

The Newstead man hopes to raise $5000 in the next month to take to Sammi to assist family and friends affected by the earthquake that devastated the country last month.

Mr Pariyar's wife Lisa Cummins said the small village had been left without food or a source of income due to the destruction of rice crops in the disaster.

Many people have been left homeless.

"My family and friends in Nepal are really struggling - they get no sleep, they can't stay in their house because the roof has moved and is broken so they're living outside under a tarp," Mr Pariyar said.

Mr Pariyar, who owns Launceston tailoring business Om Shanti, said he hoped to provide hope to those impacted by the earthquake.

He said his priority was to help provide shelter, bedding and food.

"Hopefully when I get there I will be able to give some kind of strength and unite people together," he said.

"I have to go there and see who needs desperate help.

"First I have to help my closest family and the neighbours and my other relatives there ... hopefully we can rebuild."

An online donation page has raised more than $3600 in the past fortnight and Mr Pariyar has organised a fund-raising event for June 5 at Launceston cafe Fresh.

The evening, which will start about 7pm and cost $10 entry, will feature music from Younger Dryas and Shanti Dreads plus a raffle with prizes including jeans from Om Shanti.

All money raised at the event will go to helping rebuild Mr Pariyar's village.
