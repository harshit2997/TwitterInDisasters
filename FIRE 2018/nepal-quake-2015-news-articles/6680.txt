GALLERY Tibetan temple popular with relief workers on their way out of Nepal

A street leading to the Boudhanath Stupa in Kathmandu, Nepal. Many relief workers who have been in Nepal since the April 25 earthquake stopped at the stupa May 9, 2015, on their way out of town.

KATHMANDU, Nepal — Many of the foreign relief workers who poured into Nepal following the devastating April 25 earthquake were on their way home over the weekend.

Medical personnel still in Nepal said people coming into their clinics Friday had common health issues rather than injuries sustained in the magnitude-7.9 quake.

Glenn Wright, a major in the Air Force Reserve who deployed to Nepal with a team brought in by the U.S. Agency for International Development, said search-and-rescue work was winding down late last week. The U.S. personnel uncovered one survivor — a 15-year-old boy found several days after the earthquake.

Nepal’s buildings are mostly made of brick without reinforced masonry, so when they collapsed, there were few spaces for anyone to survive, Wright said.

A yoga practitioner back home in Los Angeles, the Iraq and Afghanistan veteran said he’s been learning about the local culture and religion in Kathmandu.

“I’m a Christian, but all of us can find our own path,” he said.

For many of the relief workers, that path led to the Boudhanath, a 118-foot-high Buddhist stupa on the outskirts of Kathmandu, where they spent their last hours in Nepal shopping for souvenirs and sipping coffee.

Kenichi Kubo came to the Boudhanath after abandoning his attempt to climb Makalu, the world’s fifth-highest mountain. The 65-year-old mountaineer from Yokohama, Japan, was camping on the 27,766-foot peak and preparing for a summit ascent when the earthquake struck.

Kubo and other mountaineers were concerned that a glacier on the mountain might break apart and destroy their camp, and they voted to abandon the expedition, he said.
