Speaking at a joint press briefing with Afghan President Ashraf Ghani, Modi said that India will certainly be there when the citizens of Nepal rebuild their lives and homes.

"We are meeting in the shadow of the horrible calamity in Nepal. President Ghani and I speak for our two countries, South Asia and the world to the people of Nepal.

"Your courage and humanity have earned the respect of the world. And, you are not alone at this moment of tragedy and trial. We will do everything possible with rescue and relief. And, we will certainly be there when you rebuild your lives and reconstruct your homes and heritage," Modi said.

Three days after the 7.9-magnitude temblor flattened their homes and dwellings, desperate people across Nepal looked for succour from helicopters that criss-cross the Himalayan nation as massive international aid, including from India, poured in.

The death toll in Nepal's devastating earthquake could shoot up to 10,000 as rescuers and international aid workers today struggled to reach relief in remote areas of the country which is still battling the aftermath.
