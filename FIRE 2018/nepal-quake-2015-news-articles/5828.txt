Rahul Gandhi

New Delhi, May 1: Rahul Gandhi today visited the Nepal embassy here, penned a condolence message and promised new envoy Deep Kumar Upadhyay his party would send relief to the quake-ravaged nation, as he joined a growing queue of Indian leaders to offer help.

"Some wounds will never heal, but as Nepal faces the hard task of rebuilding each broken life and broken buildings, the people of India stand with you in strength and solidarity," the Congress leader wrote in the visitor's book. "In the years to come, we will see a stronger, more prosperous, even more beautiful Nepal."

Rahul's drive down to the embassy came on a day foreign secretary Subrahmanyam Jaishankar and national security adviser Ajit Doval visited Kathmandu and undertook an aerial survey of Gorkha district, one of the worst hit. They also met Prime Minister Sushil Koirala.

The RSS has sent senior leaders to coordinate relief efforts by its volunteers. Senior leader Dattatreya Hosabale is coordinating the efforts in Kathmandu. BJP ally Shiv Sena has sent 22,000 packets of biscuits, 7,200 water bottles, 710 blankets, 5,700 masks and 5,000 gloves, the party's heir apparent Aaditya Thackeray tweeted on Wednesday. "Thank you for the kind gesture," the Nepal embassy replied.

Punjab chief minister Parkash Singh Badal yesterday flagged off a planeload of food, milk, spices, tea and blankets. Uttar Pradesh's ruling Samajwadi Party has sent 21 trucks with food and blankets. "Now the Congress has also offered its help," Upadhyay said after Rahul's visit.

Till now, the Congress is not known to have contributed to the relief efforts.
