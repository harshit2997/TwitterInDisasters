Ottawa man in Nepal describes quake-rattled surroundings

Brett Starke will always remember the sound of crows when he looks back at his experience surviving Saturday’s earthquake in Nepal.

“The crows always started cawing about 10 seconds before a tremor,” said Starke, 29. “I’m going to take that memory away from here. That sound is always going to remind me of Kathmandu.”

The Ottawa man was just one day away form starting his trek to Mount Everest Base Camp with a group from the Dream Mountains Foundation — which includes 22 members from Eastern Ontario — when the area was hit with a 7.8 magnitude earthquake.

Starke told the Ottawa Sun on Sunday what it was like to be in the middle of so much devastation.

“I was in my room with my roommate (Matt Carson) and we were laying in our beds,” said Starke. “At first I wasn’t sure if (the shaking) was normal and didn’t think much of it. But when the closet doors and drawers started opening and slamming shut, I knew there was a problem. That was the point we headed downstairs.”

When Starke and Carson entered the hallway, they remember it being hard to see through thick clouds of dust.

“We went downstairs into the courtyard and noticed the fish from the pond were all over the lawn and about a third of the water from the pool had spilled over. Then there was another earthquake,” said Starke.

And as soon as they could, team members rushed onto e-mail and Facebook to let friends and family back home know that they were safe. No one from the group was injured.

Since the earthquake, Starke said that there have been 30 aftershocks.

And because of the unpredictable nature of the earthquake, the residents at the hotel that Starke and his team were staying at were advised to camp outside in the courtyard by the hotel manager.

“The situation is calm as can be through now,” said Starke. “It’s a hard picture to paint. We’re literally in a beautiful courtyard with a pagoda, swans, flowers and birds chirping. There’s tons of food and water for everyone at the hotel so we’re in great hands.”

Starke also said that the hotel continues to have power, Wi-fi, running hot and cold water and that they are in the best case scenario possible.

“Spirits are high,” said Starke. “Many of us are on social media trying to tell our versions of what happened. I don’t think we will ever be able to explain what we’ve seen to people who weren’t here but it brought our team together and we’re the closest we’ve ever been.”
