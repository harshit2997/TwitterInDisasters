ABOVE: Amid so much loss, a Nepalese field hospital welcomes new life

After almost a week of heart-breaking news from quake-hit Nepal, there was at last a small but beautiful moment of joy.

A baby girl was born on Friday to a young Nepalese couple in one of the field hospitals set up by foreign teams to bring emergency aid to the population.

Both mother, 19-year-old Lata Chand, and her baby, who hasnâ€™t been named yet, are doing well.

Lata was heavily pregnant when the 7.8 magnitude earthquake struck last Saturday.

Together with her husband they ran out of their house in panic.

Although their home was undamaged, the hospital where Lata was due to give birth was put out of action.

On Friday morning they went instead to a field hospital set up by the Israeli military where the infant was born.

A beaming midwife, Dganit Gery, said she hoped the news would show all Nepalese women that there was hope for the future.
