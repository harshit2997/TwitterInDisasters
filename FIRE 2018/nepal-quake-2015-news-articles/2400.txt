KUALA LUMPUR, April 27, 2015:

The dream of conquering Mount Everest for Mohd Noor Mat Amin never faded despite him having to postpone the trip due to lack of funds.

However, there is a silver lining behind the dark cloud of his financial problem.

He said if the trip had not been postponed, he might have been one of the casualties of the avalanche that was caused by the 7.9 magnitude earthquake that hit Nepal and also shook India.

“If the mission was not postponed, I would have been climbing the mountain and according to the schedule I would have started in April. I am thankful that I postponed the trip.

“The purpose to delay the trip was to continue with technical training so that I will be more capable when I scale the mountain.

“In January, I was over there to see for myself the condition of the place and to get use to the weather and then I realized that I needed more training and extra sponsors to pay for the permit to climb the mountain,” he said when contacted by The Rakyat Post.

He said the fact that he could not pay for the permit probably saved his life.

“If I managed to pay for it and started climbing, my fate would have been uncertain and I do not know if I am alive today.

“Even so I still want to conquer the highest peak in the world and this natural disaster will not change that.

“I will try again in 2016 and for now I will focus on my physical training and to open the 58 hour non stop Kinabalu Relay at Mt Kinabalu.”

He said he was thankful that the foreign ministry reported that the Universiti Teknologi Malaysia (UTM) Everest climbers were safe at the base camp.

“The tragedy that struck Nepal was a surprise and I also failed in attempts to call my friends in Kathmandu. I do not know of their fate but I hope that they are okay.

“I plan to visit the UTM climbers to give my support on May as well as to continue my training there.”
