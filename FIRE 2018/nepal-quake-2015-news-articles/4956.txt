China to carry out new round of assistance to Nepal

The Chinese government has announced plans to provide more relief assistance to Nepal.

The assistance will be focused on epidemic prevention.

Medical officials in Nepal are warning of a potential outbreak of disease, as tens-of-thousands are still being forced to live outdoors following Saturday's quake.

Five Chinese medical teams are currently working in Nepal.

At the same time, Chinese police have also arrived in Nepal to help with the earthquake relief efforts.

Chinese police have been sent in at the request of the Nepalese government.

Their main task is to open the road linking the border pass of Zham and Kathmandu.

The road between Zham and the Chinese county of Nyalam was opened last week.

The link between Zham and Kathmandu is a major source of income for people in the region, as its one of only two cross-border connections between China and Nepal.
