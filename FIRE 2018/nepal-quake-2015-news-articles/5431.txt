Fleet Feet Menlo Park hosts run for Nepal on May 7 at 6:30

Emails David Lewin-Rown, Event Director at Fleet Feet Menlo Park: “We are hosting a fundraising Run for Nepal tonight (May 7) at 6:30 pm. We hope it to be a very positive event in Menlo Park to help a community in need.

“Our longtime inventory employee, Tashi Sherpa, grew up in Namche Bazar, Nepal, which is at the base of Mt. Everest. The town and surrounding ones were hard hit by the earthquake.

“We will be taking donations and selling Run for Nepal shirts to help earthquake relief efforts. All money will go to Tashi Sherpa’s Run for Nepal fund. Tashi will be sending all money collected to community members to help rebuild Namche and surrounding towns.”
