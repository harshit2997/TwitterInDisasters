Imagine being on the other side of the world from your family when tragedy strikes. This is reality for Nepalese students at SDSU.

The Nepalese Student Association at SDSU have been a support group for each other. Many say they feel helpless being thousands of miles away from home. Together, they have raised more than $3,000 in just one day to donate to Nepal.

Thursday evening, a candle light vigil was held on campus to show support for all those affected by the earthquake in Nepal.

At SDSU, there are more than 75 Nepalese grad and undergrads. Each of them had to watch their country crumble from afar.

"I wish I was there. If I had been there, they would have some emotional support. And I'm here. I want to do something for them but I couldn't do anything from here," said Mani Awale, Nepalese Student Association.

Awale and others who have family back in Nepal say when they look out at the crowd attending the vigil, they see an extended family.

"We thought, why don't we do something. We cannot go there and help victims right away but what we can do is we can talk to people. And there are so many kind people that are willing to help anyone who's in need," said Pukar Duwadi, president of the Nepalese Student Association.

South Dakota and Nepal may be worlds apart but the Nepalese Students Association is proving they can make a difference even so far away.

Arjun Kafle is hugging his mother even tighter tonight. She's been visiting from Nepal for the past month.

"Luckily, she's here.Otherwise, my dad, they run away from the big tall building on the ground . My mom cannot run so that's why we are so lucky to have my mom here," said Kafle.

The entire city of Brookings has come together to support the Nepalese community. Mayor Tim reed even proclaimed May as 'Nepal Disaster Support Month.'
