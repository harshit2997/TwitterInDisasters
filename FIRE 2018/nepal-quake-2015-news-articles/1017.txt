One team of 25 Andhra tourists to Kathmandu was said to be safe while the whereabouts of another team of 30 from Guntur district are still not unknown after a massive earthquake measuring 7.9 on the Richter scale hit the Nepal capital on Saturday morning.

"We ran down from the fourth floor of the hotel we are staying at near Pasupathinath temple after we felt the tremors. People were screaming and running around everywhere and appealing to everyone to come out of buildings. We have taken shelter near the temple and all 25 of us are safe," one of the group members Gowri Shankar told a Telugu TV channel over phone.

On the other hand, communication with the other group of 30, which left for Kathmandu on April 21, has been lost. "My cousin Rajyalakshmi called me in the morning at 7 from her hotel room in Kathmandu to say that they were going to visit Muktinath and Pasupathinath temples. Now, we are unable to contact them, their numbers are not working," a worried family member told TV channels.

There was no loss of life and property in the eastern districts of Andhra Pradesh, which reported mild tremors. The news, however, spread panic among those living in high-rises, sending them running out of their buildings.

The impact of the earthquake was felt in Visakhapatnam city, Rajanagaram, Yanam, Ravulapalem town, Mamidikuduru, Rajahmundry, Amalapuram and Kakinada of East Godavari district, Vijayawada in Krishna district and Urlam in Srikakluam district between 11.30am and 11.45am.

Despite assurances from authorities that the worst is over, residents preferred to stay outdoors and in groups in the fear of aftershocks.
