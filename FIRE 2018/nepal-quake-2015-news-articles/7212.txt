Local Air Cadet squadrons have joined forces to donate sleeping supplies to victims of the Nepal earthquake.

In response to an appeal across Warwickshire for people to bring in any old tents and sleeping bags, a number of Air Cadet squadrons got involved by donating a number of supplies.

The appeal also went out to all West Warwickshire Scout groups and in just 48 hours, over 100 sleeping bags and 60 tents had been donated, as well as the odd roll mat, air mattress and even water purification tablets.

A spokesperson for the 163 ( Coventry Phoenix) Air Cadet Squadron, who supported the appeal, said: “The support will make a big difference to the Nepalese people in need and we estimate that the donations have been able to shelter up to 280 people, keeping them dry and warm from the elements.

“These donations were taken down to a London based drop off ready for the outbound flight.

“Thanks to the local community for the support that made this appeal the huge success that it was for the displaced people of Nepal, and credit is due to the generosity of Youth Organisations across Warwickshire area.”
