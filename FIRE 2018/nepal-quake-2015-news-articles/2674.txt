PRCS sending disaster response team to Nepal

Islamabad: In response to a request made by the Nepal Red Cross, the Pakistan Red Crescent Society (PRCS) is sending a 10-member National Disaster Response Team (NDRT) to assist with rescue and relief activities in the earthquake-devastated country.

A decision to this effect was taken on Monday during a meeting chaired by the chairman of PRCS, Dr. Saeed Elahi, and attended by chairman of PRCS AJK branch Sheikh Hameed, honorary treasurer Mumtaz Haider Rizvi, secretary general Ghulam Muhammad Awan and PRCS Fata branch chairman Ikram Ullah Kokikhel.

“PRCS is sending its best team members in the field of relief services, health and logistics to Nepal. The members of the team have been drawn from all provinces and have had extensive international trainings,” Dr. Saeed stated, while expressing sympathies with the government and people of Nepal, particularly the bereaved families and victims of the earthquake.

Awan said PRCS is in touch with the Nepal Red Cross, and has also offered tents, food items, medicines and any additional support needed to assist the victims.
