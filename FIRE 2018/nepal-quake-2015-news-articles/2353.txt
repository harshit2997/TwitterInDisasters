Still more babies to bring from Nepal, says father

Four Israeli families that were in Nepal during the earthquake that struck Nepal on Saturday return to Israel with three babies and a pair of twins.

The babies, who were all born to surrogate mothers, landed on Monday afternoon.

“There were moments of crazy fear, it was a nightmare and only now are we beginning to understand its scope,” one of the fresh fathers tells Ynet after getting off the plane.

The parents thank Magen David Adom and Interior Minister Gilad Erdan for their assistance. “There was a feeling we’re being taken care of,” says one of the fathers. “They came to pick us up, it’s like meeting angels.” Another man said “there are still two-week old babies there. It’s rainy and cold there, bring them home.”
