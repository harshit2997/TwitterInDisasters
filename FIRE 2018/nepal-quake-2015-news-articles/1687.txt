China has also dispatched a 62-member search and rescue team to Nepal to aid rescue efforts in the quake-hit nation.

BEIJING: The Chinese Government has offered $US3.3 million in humanitarian aid to earthquake-hit Nepal, the Ministry of Commerce announced on Monday (Apr 27).

The ministry added that China will use chartered planes to deliver the aid, which includes tents, blankets and generators. Beijing also pledged to help Chinese nationals return home safely.

Earlier on Sunday, China became the first international search and rescue team to reach the Himalayan nation following the 7.8-magnitude earthquake which struck on Saturday.

It sent 62 personnel along with six sniffer dogs and medical equipment to Kathmandu. On Monday a 55-strong team affiliated with the People’s Liberation Army left for Nepal to help with rescue operations. Another 45 soldiers will leave on Tuesday.

Separately, a Chinese government medical team of 58 personnel arrived in Nepal on Monday to carry out humanitarian work. It brought 13 tonnes of medical aid, and is expected to stay for 10 days to help with relief efforts. China has added that it will offer more support if needed.

Critics, however, have accused China of using the disaster to shore up its influence in the country, as it tries to end India's economic dominance in Kathmandu.

But the former Chinese ambassador to Pakistan dismissed the notion.

“What’s there to compete about in delivering aid?” said Zhang Chunxiang, former Chinese Ambassador to Pakistan. “It’s about humanism, internationalism, and acting as fast as possible. Time equals lives and saving more people. There’s no competition at all.”
