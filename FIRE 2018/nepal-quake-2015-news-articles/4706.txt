The number of Tibetans in exile in Nepal who were killed in the devastating earthquake on April 25 has risen to 10, the Central Tibetan Administration (CTA) said here on Wednesday.

The CTA - based here in Himachal Pradesh - also announced 60 lakh Nepali rupees towards relief for Tibetans affected in the neighbouring Himalayan country.

Seven adults and three children died in the quake, while four Tibetans - three nuns and a youth - were injured.

The relief money will be distributed according to a report on the damage ascertained by the relief committee composed of Tibetan leaders in Nepal, a CTA official told IANS.

Lobsang Sangay, the democratically elected political leader of the Tibetan people, expressed profound sadness and condolences to those who died and their family members.

"The CTA will do its best to provide support for the affected family members," he said in a statement.

Tibetan spiritual leader the Dalai Lama has lived in India since fleeing his homeland in 1959. The Tibetan administration in exile is based in this northern Indian hill town.
