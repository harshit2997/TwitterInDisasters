About 50 Vietnamese nationals are currently stranded in quake-hit Nepal and efforts are on to bring them home with the help of Indian government, Vietnamese envoy today said.



"About 50 Vietnamese tourists are currently stranded in Nepal. We are now trying to bring them back to Vietnam," Ambassador of Vietnam to India Ton Sinh Thanh told reporters here.



Hailing India's rescue efforts in the hilly region, he said: "We have also asked help from the Indian government to allow them (Vietnamese nationals) to get on board Indian rescue aircraft to come to India and then they can go back to Vietnam."Asked whether any team from Vietnam would join rescue operations in Nepal, he replied in the negative."No we don't have big capability as India. India is now playing very good role in Nepal", he said.The Vietnam Ambassador along with senior officials were here to inaugurate the third VFS Visa Application Centre after setting up similar Centres in Kolkata and Hyderabad.
