1. Horrific quake: Shelter, fuel, food, medicine, power, news, workers -- Nepal's earthquake-hit capital was short on everything Monday as its people searched for lost loved ones. The overall death toll soared past 4,000, even without a full accounting from vulnerable mountain villages that rescue workers were still struggling to reach two days after the disaster.

2. Local rescuers head to Nepal: At least 19 firefighters from Burnaby and Mission are heading to Nepal to help take part in rescue efforts. The firefighters, along with several rescue dogs, left Vancouver this morning.

3. Rally for skateboard lovers: Supporters and users of a skate park in Vancouver’s Mount Pleasant neighbourhood rallied on Sunday urging officials to keep the park open. The rally came ahead of today’s park board meeting that could determine the fate of the park.

4. Bear draws a crowd: A black bear was discovered wandering around Coquitlam on Sunday afternoon. The bear took some effort to tranquilize, with officials blaming a noisy crowd of onlookers for keeping it awake.

5. Parents influence needed: A meeting at a temple in Surrey was held on Sunday as people looked for solutions to the gang violence currently taking place. Jesse Johl, a community activist, said parents need to know there are resources to help them deal with kids that are falling into the gang lifestyle.
