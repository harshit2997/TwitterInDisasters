The province will donate $250,000 to Nepal earthquake relief, Saskatchewan Premier Brad Wall announced Monday.

The donation will go to the Canadian Red Cross. More than 3,000 have died after the 7.8 magnitude quake hit on Saturday.

The province pledged the same amount following disasters in The Philippines (2013), Japan (2011), Africa (2011), Haiti (2010) and Pakistan (2010).

"We can't fathom what it's like to be living through this and to be fearful," Wall said. "Now imagine trying to rebuild or even thinking about rebuilding when you first of all you haven't maybe found your loved ones."

Saskatchewan Nepalese community concerned

Among those watching events in Nepal closely is Suman Thapa, who lives in Regina but still has parents and sisters who live in the country.

They're OK, but Thapa says three people in his family's neighbourhood are dead, including a small child.

"There was one young lady when she was running with her child in her arms, running out of their house, the neighbouring house had a water tank on the roof. It came down and collapsed and both of them died instantly," he said.
