SINGAPORE- The Singapore Red Cross will disburse $50,000 worth of relief items and emergency supplies in response to the earthquake that struck Nepal on Saturday.

In a statement on Sunday, the Red Cross said it will also launch an urgent public appeal for the relief and recovery efforts in Nepal. The Singapore Government has contributed $100,000 towards this appeal as seed money. More details on the appeal and the various channels to donate will be released soon.

The 7.8-magnitude earthquake occurred near the capital Kathmandu and has killed more than 1,800 people. Mr Benjamin William, secretary general of the Singapore Red Cross, said: "According to our Red Cross responders on the ground, strong aftershocks continue to be felt adding to the risk of further damage to buildings, many are living in fear unable to return to their homes. Damage to roads and the airport means that getting relief and aid to these communities is also going to pose a great logistical challenge."

Singapore Red Cross is working with the International Committee of the Red Cross on the Restoring Family Links services. Family members who wish to contact their loved ones in the affected areas can register at http://familylinks.icrc.org/nepal-earthquake or call the Singapore Red Cross hotline on 66640501 from Monday.

Mr William appealed to the public to help the affected people as they mourn their loss and begin to rebuild their lives.
