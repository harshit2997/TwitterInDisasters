KARIMNAGAR: Fortune did not side with the 800 and odd fortune-tellers from the sleepy village of Thimmapur in Karimnagar district when the devastating earthquake rocked parts of Nepal on Saturday. Reports reaching here said a majority of the Jangam Doralu, as they are called, who left for Nepal about 10 days ago, were injured after being trapped in debris.They have been admitted to the government hospital in Kathmandu, where the condition of some of them is stated to be critical. With no news coming from the Himayalan country, their relatives back in Karimnagar district have been spending sleepless nights.Local sarpanch Kinnera Saraiah told TOI that a batch of 3000 fortune-tellers belonging to the Budiga Jangalu community had left Ramakrishna Colony in Thimmapur mandal for Nepal about 10 days ago in search of livelihood. "Budiga Jangalu or Jangam Doralu regularly visit Nepal where they sit on street-sides foretelling individuals the things that are in store for them and their families. They return to Karimnagar once they make a handsome earning," he said.Saraiah said he had received information that about 800 Jangam Doralu were injured in the earthquake. "Some of them have received head injuries. We are gathering more details. Many of them are in a state of severe shock and trauma. They are unable to speak," he said.According to locals, about 500 labourers from Anupuram village in Vemulawada temple town, 500 from Bandulapally village of Sulthanabad mandal, 600 from Gopalraopet of Ramadugu mandal and 1,000 from Durshedu village of Karimnagar mandal have been stuck in the earthquake-raved villages. "A couple of them contacted me on phone to say that they are in dire distress without water and food," Saraiah said.
