VISAKHAPATNAM: The Nepalese Students Committee of Andhra University, which was formed on Sunday to raise funds for the earthquake-affected Himalayan nation, has managed to collect around Rs 25,000 since Monday."We had conducted a rally on Beach Road on Monday to spread awareness about the situation in Nepal and have also been knocking on the doors of every hostel room in both the north and south campuses of the university for donations," said Ho Tran, a Vietnamese and the chief fund raiser for the committee.Speaking on the amount collected so far, Ho Tran and another fund raiser, Kushal Acharya, said, "We have collected a little over Rs 25,000 mainly from the foreign students' hostel and people on Beach Road. Apart from money, we are also collecting first aid kits, medicines, and anything else that can be carried.""The university authorities have also come forward to pay for our travel and transportation of goods till the India-Nepal border. They have promised to get us tickets by Wednesday or the day after," said Kushal, pointing out that Vivek Pandit, a student from Lamjung, would be carrying the money and material to Nepal."We are also planning to approach the district administration to urge them to provide us with a helpline so that the Nepalese people working in suburban areas can get information about the situation back home. As of now anybody who wishes to donate can call us on 8143237989 and 8332902536," Kushal said. The committee members said they were planning to meet the AU vice-chancellor and other higher-ups on Wednesday to urge them to provide financial aid.When contacted, AU VC Prof GSN Raju said, "Some of the professors are trying to get in touch with the alumni residing in Nepal and also the families of students studying in the university. We are also trying to take care of their journey till the border so that they can reach out to their fellow countrymen in their hour of need."
