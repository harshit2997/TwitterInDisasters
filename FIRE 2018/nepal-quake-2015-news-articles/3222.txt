(ANSA) - Rome, April 28 - Cabinet on Tuesday voted to declare a state of emergency, a formal act required in order for Italy to participate in a European Union intervention in support of Nepal in the aftermath of a devastating April 25 earthquake in which over 5,000 people are so far confirmed to have died. Calling a state of emergency allows the government to field its entire Civil Protection operational support and medical aid task force.
