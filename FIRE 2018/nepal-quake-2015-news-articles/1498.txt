Bend man missing in Nepal

A Bend man is missing in Nepal after a 6.7-magnitude earthquake rocked the south Asian country near its capital city, Kathmandu, on Saturday.

Joshua Edwards, 19, was trekking alone near the village of Muktinath in the Annapurna Conservation Area the last time his father, John Edwards, heard from him. The two last Skyped on Monday.

“I know him. He’s helping others right now, focusing on what’s in front of him,” his father said Sunday from his home in Bend. “When he has time, I’m sure he’ll contact us.”

Joshua Edwards graduated early from Summit High School in January 2014. He worked at Mt. Bachelor and Thai Thai before leaving to traverse the Pacific Crest Trail in April 2014.

John Edwards last saw his son at Christmas. He said Joshua Edwards left the next day to go rock climbing in Mexico. He then continued on to Thailand and Laos. He arrived in Nepal about a month ago.

The family has reached out the to the U.S. Embassy and the Red Cross in Nepal and has created a listing on Google Person Finder, John Edwards said.

“He’s an amazing kid,” John Edwards said. “He’s been in the wilderness. He knows what he’s doing. When there’s a crisis, he steps up and helps people.”
