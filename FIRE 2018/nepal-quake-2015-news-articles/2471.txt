A TEAM of firefighters have flown out to help the earthquake relief effort in Nepal.

The country was struck by the deadly 7.9 magnitude quake on Saturday and least 3,326 people have known to have died and more than 6,500 injured.

It triggered avalanches on Mount Everest which has left more than 200 climbers' stranded, while many villages have been completely wiped out.

Hampshire Fire and Rescue Service have sent 10 fire fighters, who join a team of more than 60 search and rescue responders and medical experts as part of the UK International Search and Rescue team (UK-ISAR).

A DFID-chartered flight left last night, Sunday, from London for Nepalese capital Kathmandu, carrying seven UK International Search and Rescue crews, four search and rescue dogs, a medical support team and hazardous materials specialists.

It also carried trauma medics, a five strong Foreign Office Rapid Deployment Team who will provide consular assistance for British nationals affected by the disaster and experts from aid agencies.

International Development secretary Justine Greening, said: “Our thoughts are with all those affected by this terrible earthquake. The UK is doing everything it can to help Nepal recover and provide assistance to British nationals caught up in the disaster.

“We are deploying highly trained experts in search and rescue and trauma medicine to pull people from the rubble and save lives. These are brave men and women who will be doing crucial, life-saving work on behalf of the UK.”
