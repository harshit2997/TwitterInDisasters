Birmingham Nepalese, worried about quake victims back home, to host fundraiser today at UAB
</headline>

For Birmingham residents who are natives of Nepal, it has been agonizing to watch from afar as their country has been hit by earthquakes that have killed over 8,000 people and displaced hundreds of thousands more.

"The main emotional challenge I, along with others, are facing is being helpless, not being able to be present physically back home for assistance in this dire situation," said Samir Rana, a graduate student in biomedical sciences at The University of Alabama at Birmingham (UAB), in an email to AL.com on Wednesday.

"We constantly worry about our family and friends as earthquake and aftershocks continue to hit," Prashant Shrestha, a programmer and analyst at UAB and a UAB graduate, said in an email Wednesday. "It is very stressful to wait and hope from afar."

But now Rana, Shrestha and other members of the Birmingham Nepalese community - some of whom are members of the ALabama Nepalese Association (ALNA) - will host a fundraiser to help quake victims at The Edge of Chaos events venue on the UAB campus today at 5:30 p.m.

The group - including UAB faculty, staff, students and alumni from Nepal - is seeking donations to support the immediate needs of those affected by the disaster. The event will feature cultural displays, traditional Nepalese snacks and video presentations about the quakes and relief efforts, according to organizers.

There are roughly 150-200 people from Nepal living in the Birmingham area, most of them with some connection to UAB, organizers say.

Both Rana and Shrestha are fortunate in that none of their close friends or immediate family members back home have been injured, though Shrestha lost a distant relative.

However, they are concerned about other negative effects of the quakes back home. "I also worry about the psychological impact on them; adults as well as children are scared to go indoors now with constant fear, Shrestha said.

To channel the money raised in Birmingham to the people in need, the fundraisers have partnered with Play to Help Inc., a non-profit in Monterey, Calif., that is already working with other non-profits to build homes, schools and health posts in Nepal, according to organizers.

Local Nepalese have already raised about $1,200 to provide supplies and toilets to quake victims and, along with the UAB School of Public Health, collected some medical and sanitary supplies to be sent to affected areas, according to Rana.

The Edge of Chaos is located on the fourth floor of the Lister Hill Library. For more information about the event, call 205-934-7723 or go to http://theedgeofchaos.org.
