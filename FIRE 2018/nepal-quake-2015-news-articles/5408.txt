Nepalese students at Mount Holyoke request donations for survivors of Nepal earthquake

SOUTH HADLEY â€” When Arati Sharma joined the Society of Ex-Budhanilkantha Students it was a way to connect with students from her high school in Nepal and stay connected to home.

Sharma, a senior studying economics and philosophy at Mount Holyoke College, is now working with fellow Mount Holyoke students and Nepalese immigrants, Prarthana Bhattarai and Akchheta Karki, to help the society collect donations for survivors of the devastating earthquake that struck Nepal on April 25, 2015.

"We are collecting money so that we can channel it to local organizations based in Nepal that are actively providing relief to the victims of the earthquake," she said.

Aside from her friends Sharma is getting some help from Jef Sharp, owner of Qnect, a software company in Hadley where Sharma is an intern.

"We are all working to raise funds from local businesses in the region," she said, asking people to donate directly to the SEBS (the society) website.

Money collected here will go towards the purchase of food and supplies that are desperately needed.

For $70 a family receives rice, salt, oil, dried pulses (legumes), electrolyte water and a tent.

"We got the list of essential items from one of our friends who is working with the society, which is a non-profit organization," she said, adding that the entire donation goes to the families.

For Sharma and her friends being away from home is difficult.

"We were born and raised in Nepal, and all our families are in Nepal," she said. "Fortunately, they are all safe."

Sharma said there are several other organizations providing relief to Nepal.

"In addition to SEBS (the society) we have identified some other organizations that are actively involved in providing relief," she said.

These include:

*Himalayan Climate Initiative

*Help Nepal Network

*Grassroots Movement in Nepal
