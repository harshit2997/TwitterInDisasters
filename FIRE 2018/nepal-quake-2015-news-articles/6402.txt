Police stayed behind to guard the county."All the police have now been evacuated. No casualties were reported," said Phurjung from the Zham Police headquarters.In Nyalam, power was cut off and three houses collapsed.The devastating April 25 temblor has claimed more than 8,000 lives in Nepal and left 26 dead in Tibet.
