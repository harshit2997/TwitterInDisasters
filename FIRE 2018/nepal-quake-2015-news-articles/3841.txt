Nepal earthquake: Jenny Davson-Galle’s ‘yet to see the worst’
</headline>

<text>
TASMANIAN adventurer Jenny Davson-Galle was high up in the Himalayas away from danger when Nepal was hit by the magnitude 7.8 earthquake on Saturday.

Jenny’s mother, Christine Davson-Galle, said yesterday she feared the worst was yet to come for her daughter.

Mrs Davson-Galle said she did not know if her daughter was aware of the devastation in Kathmandu and other areas around the quake’s epicentre.

More than eight million people are thought to be affected by the quake, which devastated Kathmandu.

The death toll is rising ­towards 6000 and is expected to reach 10,000.

Mrs Davson-Galle said Jenny, 29, would eventually have to make her way back to Kathmandu.

“That is going to be a really tricky one for her,” she said. “To see the atrociousness, and the sadness of all the people.”

She said her daughter had been to Nepal “six or seven times, I have lost track”.

Jenny had spent a lot of time at refugee camps in Nepal, was walking across the Himalayas in stages from west to east and had a lot of Nepalese friends in both Nepal and Tasmania.

“When she was 16 she went [to Nepal] with Launceston College, even though she was in year 10 at Exeter High School,” Mrs Davson-Galle said.

“She went over for three weeks and that was when she fell in love with going to Nepal.”

Jenny’s latest trip to Nepal had been to attend a wedding and to do a multi-day walk in the Himalayan Kangchenjunga region.

“I thought, ‘Will she come back or will she try to do something to try to find her friends’?” she said.

“I don’t know how many friends that she has lost.”

Jenny and fellow Tasmanian Julien Tempone-Wiltshire, 24, told their families that they were safe on Tuesday.

There are 1250 Australians thought to be safe in Nepal and an unknown number are still unaccounted for.
