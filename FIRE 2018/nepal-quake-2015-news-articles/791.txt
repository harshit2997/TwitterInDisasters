New Delhi :

A simple skype call turned horrific on Saturday morning during a family conversation of News Nation employee Rahul Ranjan with his relative’s in Kathmandu, Nepal.

Minutes after the call, Rahul witnessed a shaky scene at his relative’s place. The laptop shook tremendously, things started falling down from shelves and cupboards flew open.

He could see his relatives taking shelter below the bed and under the tables. But as the aftershocks came again and again, the relatives ran to the doors, down the staircase and outside the building. They were residing at the 7th floor so running outside only seemed an option that time.

The family of four, which includes mother, father, a boy and a girl, has been in constant touch with Rahul and his family.

According to Rahul, “the girl was in office when the quake came, she is alright but has not been able to reach her family yet. There have been some occasional calls made but in vain. While the boy is trying to help out the parents, however, he fears that taking them to airport can lead to another tragedy.”

The family has been in regular touch with Rahul on phone, however, now their batteries are discharged and with no power supply things have become a little tenuous and strained.

“There are nearly hundreds, including locals, Indians and foreigners, stranded at Kathmandu airport. However, the government and embassies are of no help. We are at nobody’s mercy. A little rumour can also lead to a stampede at the airport which is dreaded by us. Our daughter is also missing. Therefore they are braving the chill and rain and waiting for help outside their homes,” revealed the family on phone call with Rahul.

“With recent rains and no food, no water, no safety and little hope of survival. Only God is with us. We just hope to be out of hell soon,” said the family.

Now, the family wants to unite with the daughter and plans to rush to India soon.

A devastating earthquake measuring 7.9 on Richter scale hit Nepal on Friday morning killing nearly 2000 and injuring more than 5000.
