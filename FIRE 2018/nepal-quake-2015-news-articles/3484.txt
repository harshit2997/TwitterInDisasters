</headline>

<text>
A NATIONWIDE donation drive has been launched in Bahrain to help Nepal recover from Saturday's devastating earthquake.

The Royal Charity Organisation (RCO) yesterday formed the Bahrain-Nepal Support Committee following directives from His Majesty King Hamad.

It will collect 40 tonnes of food and medical aid for survivors. Eight million people are estimated by the UN to have been affected '“ more than a quarter of Nepal's population.

His Majesty's Representative for Charity Work and Youth Affairs and RCO chairman Shaikh Nasser bin Hamad Al Khalifa will head the panel. He issued an edict appointing RCO secretary-general Dr Mustafa Al Sayed to chair the committee.

The death toll from the 7.8-magnitude quake reached more than 5,000 yesterday, but Nepalese officials say it could be as high as 10,000.

In addition to humanitarian aid, Bahrain is sending a 25-member medical team that includes doctors, nurses and evacuation experts to Nepal.

'It was important for us to channel public support in Bahrain to help rebuild Nepal,' said Dr Al Sayed.

'We have partnered with LuLu Hypermarkets, which will sell special food packages containing essential items required for survivors.'

The special food packages containing dry fruits and other items will be available from today at all LuLu outlets and customers can deposit them in special collection boxes at the hypermarkets.

It follows an appeal by the Nepalese government for immediate humanitarian assistance from the international community. Immediate and urgent relief materials currently required include blankets, food, drinking water, tents, medicines and treatment kits.

Many countries have sent aid including India, China, the UK and the US.

Dr Al Sayed said tents, mattresses, water purifiers and other items along with a list of medications would be delivered from Bahrain.

The first aid consignment containing 40 tonnes of food and other items is expected to leave Bahrain on May 4.

His Majesty's Representative for Charity Work and Youth Affairs and RCO chairman Shaikh Nasser bin Hamad Al Khalifa will head the panel. Shaikh Nasser issued an edict appointing Mr Al Sayed to chair the committee.

'There will be around 25 medics including doctors, nurses and evacuation experts from Bahrain to help rescue the survivors and work with other relief organisations,' said Dr Al Sayed.

The Bahrain Red Crescent Society (BRCS) has also launched a donation drive and people can deliver items to its headquarters in Hoora.

Society secretary-general Dr Fawzi Amin told the GDN yesterday that the names of donors would be included on a list of donors.

'We need to encourage the public to donate so that it is not only the government that is providing assistance, but also the people living in Bahrain, including expatriates,' said Dr Amin.

He said the society had prepared a list of items needed by rescue teams in Nepal to help survivors.

It includes 4,000 food parcels, 20,000 blankets, 2,000 water containers, 500 tents, 1,000 water containers with taps, 20,000 pillows, 20,000 towels, 2,160 hygiene kits, 1,000 mats and 90 power generators.

There is a separate list of required medication.

Challenge

Meanwhile, Nepalese Ambassador Mani Prasad Bhattarai said bad weather conditions and landslides in some areas around the epicentre of the earthquake were compounding the challenge faced by rescue workers.

'Rescue teams cannot access some areas because the roads are blocked and there are several locations in the mountainous region where teams are yet to reach and help,' the diplomat told the GDN.

He added that 12 Bahrainis who had been issued visas to travel to Nepal had been confirmed safe.

The GDN reported earlier this week that at least four Nepalese nationals living in Bahrain lost family members in the country's worst earthquake in decades.

One of them, Dil Bahadur Tamang, lost his six-year-old son and father-in-law in the earthquake, which wrecked houses, flattened centuries-old temples and triggered avalanches on Mount Everest.

Bahrain's Foreign Affairs Ministry had said there were 78 Bahraini citizens and residents trapped in Nepal, but there were no casualties.

In the event of an emergency, people are being asked to contact the Bahrain Embassy in India on 00918130847733 or 00919899060616.

Meanwhile, the ministry yesterday urged Bahrainis in Pakistan to abide by safety instructions following an earthquake there measuring 5.5 on the Richter scale in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province.

Bahrainis should contact the Bahrain Embassy in Pakistan on 00923133355553, 00923346222222 or 0092512307882 for help.

Alternatively, they can call the ministry in Bahrain on 0097317227555 or follow on Twitter @bahdiplomatic.
