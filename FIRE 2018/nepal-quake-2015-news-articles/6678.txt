The earthquakes in Nepal are tragic on many levels, most obviously in the sheer number of people who have lost their lives and the many more who have lost their homes, says Wake Forest Law Professor John Knox, United Nations Independent Expert on Human Rights and the Environment. News agencies have reported the death toll at more than 8,000 and rising in light of Tuesday’s second major quake. Knox predicts that circumstances may get much worse there before they start to get better, “if water and supplies run low and assistance agencies are overwhelmed. There is going to be an enormous need for assistance for quite some time.”

Wake Forest Law rising third-year student Nick Griffin (’16) has worked in Nepal and has many friends there. “Thankfully, my friends appear to be OK,” he says.

Griffin, who was planning on returning to Nepal this summer to continue the work he began last year, adds, “It is a truly tragic situation in Nepal right now. Electricity is out, there is no running water, communications are down, aftershocks continue and hundreds of thousands are living in open spaces out of fear the buildings will collapse in the night.”

Prior to starting his first year at Wake Forest Law, Griffin moved halfway across the world to Kathmandu, Nepal, where he volunteered as a Model United Nations (MUN) instructor and traveled across South East Asia for six months. Griffin returned to Nepal in the summer of 2014 following his participation in the law school’s London study abroad program to work as a legal research intern at the International Center for Integrated Mountain Development, funded by a Public Interest Law Organization (PILO) grant. PILO grants are given to Wake Forest Law students who have secured an unpaid, public interest-related summer internship when funding is available. Griffin used his PILO grant to conduct a two-month project that analyzed the intersection between sustainable water access and cultural heritage preservation, focusing on an ancient stone spout water distribution network that still functions as a primary source for 350,000 people in Kathmandu Valley.

Given his familiarity with the area, Griffin recommends the following organizations accepting donations for Nepal relief for those who are interested in helping.

Griffin will work this summer for the Southern Environmental Law Center in Chapel Hill, N.C., with the hope that he will be able to return to Nepal following graduation next year.
