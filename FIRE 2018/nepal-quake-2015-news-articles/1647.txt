New Delhi: The death toll in India from Saturday’s monster earthquake on Monday shot up to 72 even as New Delhi ramped up relief and rescue efforts in Nepal to provide succour to the nation devastated by the temblor.

Union home minister Rajnath Singh informed the Lok Sabha that the toll in the country has climbed up to 72 with 56 deaths reported in Bihar, 12 in UP, three in West Bengal and one in Rajasthan.

However, in a frank admission, Mr Singh said in the Lok Sabha that he was not aware of the news of the devastating earthquake hitting Nepal on Saturday till Prime Minister Narendra Modi informed him.

Enumerating the mammoth task undertaken by India to mitigate the sufferings of the Nepalese people under ‘Operation Maitri’, Mr Singh said 10 NDRF teams are already in that country and six more on their way. An engineering task force and 18 medical units have also been rushed. Over 5,400 Indians have been evacuated from quake-hit Nepal so far and free visas are being given to foreigners stranded there who want to come to India. Seven tourists from Assam are feared dead in Nepal.

Congress chief Sonia Gandhi wrote to Nepal PM on Monday expressing solidarity. Meanwhile, a fresh trembler measuring 5.1 on the Richter Scale was felt in some districts across West Bengal.

1078: National disaster helpline

India on Monday launched a national disaster helpline 1078 as it intensified relief and rescue operations in earthquake-hit Nepal by deploying more aircraft and military helicopters. NDMA member-secretary R.K. Jain said the National Disaster helpline — 1078 — has been made operational to help people seek information about their near and dear ones. “Anybody can use this number by dialing 011-1078 and whatever request we get will be shared with agencies concerned involved in the operation,” he told reporters.
