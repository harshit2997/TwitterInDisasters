Free for Life Ministries in Franklin has a safe house and several sewing centers for women who have escaped sex slavery in Nepal.

In the wake of a devastating earthquake, the ministry's focus has gone from freeing sex slaves to saving lives.

Free for Life has taken 550 girls in Nepal out of slavery. Eighty women and girls were part of the latest graduating sewing class, but that sewing center is now in rubble.

"The first day I spent just on the computer and in tears, just seeing whether our people are alive," said Collette Bercu with Free for Life. "Every single one of our people are alive. So we now have a team going from here and will meet up there."

Free for Life has a safe house where they rescue the women and girls. A 7-year-old and a 10-year-old are currently being housed there. The sewing centers also teach the women a trade.

"We have worked there so long and so hard to be here talking with you," Bercu said. "But I know that I can do more here than I can going to Nepal. I can ask from here. Your viewers have just knocked themselves out for us before. I'm just asking now, help us help them."

Bercu has helped assemble a team of 12 that is heading to Nepal. So far, she has raised $23,000 just over the week. It all goes to medical supplies, shelters, food and water.

With relationships with 40 people in five towns, Bercu's aid will go directly to the people who need it.

"Nobody can get in to help, but our people know every single route into that place," Bercu said. "We have been put there for a time such as this."

Sunday, Bercu was asked to speak at Christ Church Nashville. She spoke for five minutes and people stood in line to donate.
