From jumping in a chopper to walking for hours, Calgarian will soon be back from Nepal

It’s been a long journey for a Calgary-based artist and yoga instructor who has seen the devastation in Nepal first-hand, but it’s almost over.

Tamara McLeod has gotten to the Canadian embassy in Kathmandu and is expecting to get on a plane heading for New Delhi Friday, although it’s not exactly clear when she will arrive in Canada.

For the last week, McLeod has been trying to get to the Nepal capital, but has been faced with multiple barriers and now that she’s homeward bound, her sister Michelle Dack said it’s a huge relief.

“She’s just absolutely in such an experience of gratitude, it’s beautiful listening to her,” Dack said.

During her stay in Nepal, McLeod was actually scheduled to be near where the devastating earthquake hit, but decided to go off her planned course.

“The fact that she was there was one of the reasons that she was able to stay safe during this whole natural disaster, so we’re feeling very grateful for that,” she said.

When the earthquake hit, a family in the village of Briddim took her in, fed her and gave her shelter in a tent.

Her coordinates were relayed to her family and then sent to the Nepal military, who then dispatched a helicopter.

When she saw the chopper in the air, McLeod embraced her family, gave them some money and then ran through a rice field and hopped in.

She thought she was headed to Kathmandu.

“They landed in Dhunche,” Dack said, which is 45 kilometres away from the capital. “She had to walk for seven hours in heavy rain on roads that were all blocked with boulders and debris from the earthquake and the avalanche.”

McLeod eventually got to a hotel to get some rest and the next day she was on a bus headed for Kathmandu, where she was able to get WI-Fi access and notify her family that she was safe.

“She’s freaking out, she’s so happy, I can’t believe how happy she is,” Dack said, adding the family is extremely grateful for the support from the public.

McLeod will be asking people who want to give to donations, to forward them to the family that housed her in Briddim and other villagers.
