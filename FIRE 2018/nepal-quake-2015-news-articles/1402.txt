BHUBANESWAR: Tour operators in the state have started witnessing mass cancellation of bookings by tourists to Nepal in the wake of Saturday's devastating earthquake and aftershocks on Sunday.It coincided with the state government advising people to defer their tours to the quake-ravaged nation. "Though we have not officially issued any advisory for visitors, we urge people to exercise caution," tourism and culture secretary Arvind Padhee told TOI.The tourism department has no official information about anyone from the state being stranded in Nepal, Padhee said. Private tour operators said over 300 people have cancelled their trips, scheduled for May and June. "Several travel agents under our association have started cancelling bookings. Tourists, mostly newlywed couples, are apprehensive to visit Nepal now. It is a blow to Nepal tourism and us," said Debashis Mahapatra, chief executive officer of K-7 Holidays and joint secretary of Travel Agents' Association of Odisha.Benjamin Simon of Travel Link, which arranges overseas tour packages, said over 2,000 people from the state visit Nepal every year. "Nepal is the most sought-after foreign destination for middle-class families as hotels and airfares are cheaper and visa is not required. We usually float tour packages to Nepal in summer. Cancellation of bookings is imminent after the deadly earthquake," Simon said.Tour operators charge between Rs 15,000 and Rs 19,000 (excluding air ticket) per person for four days five nights trip to Nepal, sources said. "Tourism is a major source of revenue for the largely agrarian nation, one of the world's poorest. Visitors from around the world, particularly India and China, flock to its Buddhist monasteries and majestic mountain retreats. For expert climbers, the challenge of scaling Everest beckons them to the tiny nation," Simon said.
