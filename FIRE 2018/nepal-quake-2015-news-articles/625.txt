Madison (WKOW)-- One day after a devastating 7.8 magnitude earthquake hit the country of Nepal, students at UW-Madison are brainstorming ways to bring in donations."We first wanted to make sure our families were okay, but then we wanted to help," Nepal Student Association President Surendra Prajapati says.The Nepal Student Association met Sunday afternoon to discuss their plans for collecting donations and raising awareness of the growing need in Nepal. Many of the members have family members who were directly impacted by the earthquake."Some of them lost family members, which is very sad. I lost several distant family members and neighbors," Prajapati explains."We are thinking about the aftermath now more than what has happened. Those who are dead, are dead, but those who are alive, we have to take care of them as well."Group members say there's around 20 or so Nepalese students and faculty members on UW-Madison campus, but more than 200 Nepalese immigrants living in the city of Madison. They're working with the surrounding community to start a fundraising campaign that should be launched later this week.In the meantime, members have decided to partner with Sarvodaya USA, a Madison-based nonprofit group that helps impoverished communities in Nepal and Sri Lanka.Board members of Sarvodaya USA currently have members working in Nepal and have decided to set up a donation page on their website SarvodayaUSA.org UW students are also planning a candle light vigil at the State Capitol in honor of the victims in Nepal. The group is planning to hold the vigil sometime this week.
