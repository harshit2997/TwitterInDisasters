Cambodian Red Cross to Donate $10K to Nepal
</headline>

<text>
The Cambodian Red Cross (CRC) has pledged $10,000 to assist relief efforts in Nepal, where more than 3,700 people have died and about 6,500 have been injured following an earthquake on Saturday.

“Now we are inquiring about bank details so we can transfer the cash,” CRC spokeswoman Men Neary Sopheak said Monday.

“It is the humanitarian mission and we belong to the Red Cross movement, so we donate to the Red Cross of Nepal,” she added. “It is according to our principle of universality, so we help each other in case of need and disaster.”

Last week, a representative of the International Organization for Migration said that about $40,000 was needed to pay for the repatriation of the 94 Cambodian fishermen who had been rescued from the remote Indonesian island of Benjina, where they were stranded after being enslaved on Thai-captained fishing vessels.

Ms. Neary Sopheak said the CRC had not offered help to the fishermen because “we haven’t seen the appeal.”
