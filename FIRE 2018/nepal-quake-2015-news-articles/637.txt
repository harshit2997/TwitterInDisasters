New Zealand urban search and rescue mobilised for Nepal

Forty-five specialised urban search and rescue (USAR) personnel from across New Zealand have mobilised in response to Nepal's devastating earthquake.

New Zealand Fire Service (NZFS) USAR technicians, 15 each from the three main taskforce areas of Canterbury, Auckland and Palmerston North are meeting in Auckland tonight. There they will wait for the order from the Government to travel to Nepal.

Thousands are reported to be trapped under rubble after a 7.8 earthquake struck at 11.41am local time on Saturday.

NZFS acting national operations manager Ken Cooper said the selected personnel were trained in using search and rescue cameras, listening devices and line rescues. Four dog handlers had also been selected.

"They are all now moving to our base in Auckland. It is a heightened level of alert, but not yet [an order] to travel," he said.

Cooper said USAR just last month received its international accreditation, which means it can operate overseas.

Many of those being mobilised were involved in USAR during the 2011 Christchurch earthquake response, he said.

For much of Sunday, USAR had been involved in negotiations with the MInistry of Foreign Affairs and Trade, waiting for authority to mobilise.
