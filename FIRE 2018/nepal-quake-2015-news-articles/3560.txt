People in Waterford urged to support relief efforts in Nepal

Trócaire is supporting the distribution of shelter and other vital aid to people affected by the weekend’s earthquake in Nepal.

The organisation has launched an emergency appeal and is requesting the support of people in Waterford to fund an emergency response. People can donate to Trócaire’s emergency appeal at trocaire.org or by phoning 1850 408 408.

The numbers of dead and wounded continue to rise and the scale of the response needed is likely to be huge given that the situation in some areas of the country is not yet clear.

Trócaire is working with partner organisations in the Caritas network of humanitarian agencies in Nepal. The Caritas network is currently arranging for 2,000 shelters, 167,000 water purification tablets and over 40,000 hygiene kits to be distributed to affected communities in the coming days.
