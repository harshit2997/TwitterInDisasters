Scripps to send medical team to Nepal
</headline>

<text>
A trauma team from Scripps Health is headed to Nepal, where a devastating earthquake has created a critical need for skilled medical workers.

Chris Van Gorder sent out a companywide email Tuesday afternoon informing the health system’s employees that a team, operating in collaboration with the International Medical Corps, will leave Thursday or Friday for the mountainous nation where a 7.8 magnitude earthquake killed more than 4,600 people -- at latest count -- and injured more than 9,000.

It will be the third such mission for Scripps, which deployed similar teams to help out in the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina in 2005 and Haiti’s devastating 2010 earthquake.

Van Gorder said Scripps is committed to overseas medical missions out of a sense of duty and because they help provide valuable experience.

“You know, earthquakes, along with fires, are the most likely disasters we’re going to see in San Diego. We bring that knowledge back, and it helps us prepare here locally for a disaster that might hit somewhere here in this country,” Van Gorder said.

Scripps is teaming up, the executive said, with medical response teams at Stanford and Harvard universities, a move that spreads the load between three organizations.

“This allows each organization to send a relatively small team, compared to the size of the organization, so it doesn't take a lot of resources away from the hospitals,” Van Gorder said.

The plan is for the team to be deployed for 21 days. In the meantime, Scripps will assemble a second team that can be sent when the first returns. Most of the personnel headed over in the first wave have prior experience during Scripps two previous medical missions.

The medical team will work in field trauma hospital set up by the Medical Corps. once they arrive in Nepal. The exact location of the hospital has not been announced.

This will be the first overseas endeavor that Van Gorder, a former police officer and current reserve assistant sheriff, will miss.

Though he said he would like to go to oversee the security of his employees, prior commitments, he said, make that impossible.

“I've got some organizational commitments that I have made that I cannot change or get out of,” Van Gorder said.
