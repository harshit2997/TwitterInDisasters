A 58-member medical team sent by the Chinese government arrived in Nepal yesterday to help with relief efforts after massive earthquake struck the Himalayan region on Saturday.

China also dispatched four Ilyushin IL-76 transport aircraft yesterday to help with the rescue operation, according a military website affiliated with The PLA Daily.

China Military Online quoted Colonel Shen Jinke, a spokesman for the People's Liberation Army Air Force, as saying the four aircraft were chosen because the division had experience in conducting military operations abroad.

Two of the planes will be deployed from Chengdu and the other two will be sent from Kunming . All four transport aircraft, carrying relief personnel and military rescue equipment, were sent to Kathmandu.

The medical team, which includes psychiatric specialists, pharmacists and experts in bone treatment, is based in Sichuan province in western China, Xinhua said.

The team took 13 tonnes of medical supplies and was expected to stay 10 days to help with relief efforts.

A 62-member China International Search and Rescue Team (CISAR) arrived in Kathmandu on Sunday.

The CISAR team includes rescuers, medical staff, earthquake experts and engineers, as well as six search-and-rescue dogs.

Members of the team have worked in disasters such as the Sichuan earthquake in 2008 as well as in Japan, Haiti and Pakistan.

"We worked at the scene continuously for a day and night, and forgot that today is the anniversary of China's International Rescue Team," Qu Guosheng, the team's deputy chief, said.

Qu was in Nepal last month training local rescue teams.

The Ministry of Commerce has pledged 20 million yuan (HK$25 million) in humanitarian aid, including tents, blankets, and generators, to Nepal.
