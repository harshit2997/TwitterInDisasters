SAN DIEGO (KUSI) - Scripps Health President and CEO, Chris Van Gorder, provided an update on the contingent from Scripps Health corporate offices Tuesday.



A Marine helicopter based at Camp Pendleton was reported missing in Nepal today, while four nurses and a team leader from Scripps Health in San Diego were said to be safe following a second major, 7.3-magnitude, earthquake in the Himalayan country.



The contingent from Scripps Health was reported to be OK. They've been in Nepal for more than a week, treating hundreds of victims of the 7.8-magnitude earthquake that struck April 25.



Most of their time has been spent in remote mountain villages, northwest of the capital of Kathmandu, that were devastated by the first quake, which killed more than 7,000 people and injured thousands more.



The quake Tuesday reportedly killed around 70 people.
