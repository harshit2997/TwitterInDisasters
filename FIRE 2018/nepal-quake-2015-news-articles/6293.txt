(WLNS) – Officials are expecting the worst as they begin to travel to isolated Himalayan towns and villages buried under rubble.

As of right now, 65 people are confirmed dead and more than 2,000 others hurt but those numbers are only expected to grow.

According to the U.S. Geological survey, Tuesday’s magnitude 7.3 quake is the biggest aftershock since April’s earthquake killed more than 8,000.

Roughly 300 U.S. troops are helping victims in Nepal but a U.S. Marine helicopter on its way to the country was reported missing Tuesday.

According to officials, the chopper was carrying six marines and two Nepalese Army soldiers that were delivering aid to the country.

Officials say there is no reason to believe the helicopter went down.
