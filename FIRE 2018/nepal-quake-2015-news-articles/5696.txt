(ANSA) - Milan, May 1 - Italian Premier Matteo Renzi visited the Nepal pavilion at Expo along with Commissioner Giuseppe Sala Friday.

"We won't give up," he told a crowd of supporters. In front of the pavilion was a giant collage of photographs of the earthquake that devastated the country on April 25 and the word Nepal written in red.
