(CS) Three volunteers from Luxembourg's “Protection Civile” set off for Nepal on Sunday night, carrying with them an emergency.lu crisis communications kit.



Following an appeal by the Nepalese government for international solidarity, the World Food Programme's Emergency Telecommunications Cluster was called into action.



With Luxembourg an active member of the cluster it was decided that emergency.lu would be deployed to the region, in which most communications infrastructure has collapsed.



The mobile satellite unit will help coordinate relief efforts.



The Luxembourg volunteers left for Nepal on board a Belgian military plane in a cooperation with rescue team B-FAST and were set to land Monday morning. A fourth volunteer will travel to Nepal from Dubai on Monday.

Two further emergency.lu kits, that are currently being brought back to Luxembourg from the Vanuatu islands in the Pacific, will also be deployed to Nepal as soon as possible.



A fourth emergency.lu unit has been in use in Nepal since 2012 in the Dadeldhura district, in the far west of Nepal on the border to India, to support the World Food Programme's work in the remote mountain region. With Dadeldhura largely unaffected by Saturday's earthquake, this kit is on standby to be sent to the Kathmandu area in case of need.



Over 3,000 people are believed to have been killed in the massive earthquake that hit Nepal on Saturday. The death toll has kept on rising since the 7.8-magnitude earthquake that was followed by a number of aftershocks.
