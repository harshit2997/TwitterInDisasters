Nepali Billionaire Chaudhary Plunges Into Relief Work, Says Earthquake 'Huge Setback' For Country
</headline>

<text>
Three days after Nepal experienced its worst ever earthquake in eight decades, the death toll is mounting as relief workers struggle to extricate bodies from the debris. The government estimates that 10,000 people may have died. As many as 8 million people could have been affected, as per a United Nations report.

“We’re all in a state of trauma. It’s a huge mess “ said Nepali billionaire Binod Chaudhary, when I spoke to him by phone today.

Chaudhary, who was touring the Chitwan area, outside Kathmandu, with his two sons the day the earthquake struck, has since returned to the capital. The building housing the headquarters of his Chaudhary Group, which I had visited some years ago, had to be evacuated since it has developed huge cracks. “We’re struggling to relocate our 500 staff elsewhere, “ said Chaudhary speaking from a makeshift home-office.

Meantime, the group has pitched in to provide relief to victims by distributing water, medical supplies and thousands of packets of its famous Wai Wai ready-to-eat noodles in quake-hit areas. Schools run by the group have been turned into shelters and medical camps. Chaudhary and his sons are using Twitter and Facebook to provide updates on the relief work.

While electricity supply has been partially restored, communication still remains a problem as internet services have been hit. The group’s back-up server in Delhi, where his youngest son is stationed, has saved the day, notes Chaudhary.

The billionaire says that the aftershocks from the quake have made Kathmandu’s residents paranoid that the city is no longer safe to live in and he foresees a mass exodus. The quake has already destroyed several buildings and notable heritage structures. "We've experienced more than 80 tremors these past few days, " said Chaudhary adding that he and his family have shifted to the ground floor of their home and sleep with the windows open.

In a bid to boost morale, the billionaire addressed a town hall meeting of his group, urging staff to try to get themselves back on track. “ It will take months to restore normalcy in Nepal. Restoring people’s confidence could take longer. “
