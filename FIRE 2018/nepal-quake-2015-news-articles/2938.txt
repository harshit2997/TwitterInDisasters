Some 4,355 people were already confirmed dead and 8,065 other injured, while hundreds were still missing across the Himalayan country following Saturday's 7.9-magnitude earthquake, according to the Home Ministry.



Koirala's media advisor Prakash Adhikari told reporters that Nepal was seeking more and quicker international aid to provide both immediate assistance to the quake victims and to rebuild the economy.
