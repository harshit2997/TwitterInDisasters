The US Pacific Command has said an American Marine Corps helicopter offering quake relief in Nepal was declared missing with eight people on board.

Six US Marines and two Nepalese soldiers were on board. The helicopter was last seen after another helicopter in the vicinity "picked up some (radio) chatter about a fuel problem". A Pentagon spokesman said a 90-minute search by three US military aircraft failed to locate the aircraft before nightfall and a ground search by Nepalese troops was underway.
