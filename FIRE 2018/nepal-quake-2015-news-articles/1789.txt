</headline>

President Joko 'Jokowi' Widodo says that Indonesia will send humanitarian relief to earthquake-devastated Nepal in the next three to four days.

'I want to stress that Indonesia is ready to help Nepal. It is still being discussed because the airport in the Nepalese capital Kathmandu is still paralyzed and is expected to resume operations in the next three to four days,' he said after a gala dinner with ASEAN Summit delegates in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, on Sunday night.

The President said the government was still discussing whether the humanitarian relief would be dispatched through India or directly to Nepal.

He said that besides the humanitarian aid supplies, Indonesia would also send rescue workers and a medical team to help search for quake victims and provide medical assistance to injured victims.

Foreign Minister Retno LP Marsudi said the Foreign Ministry was still finalizing an internal coordination regarding sending the humanitarian aid.

'Tomorrow [Monday] there will be a detailed discussion on what kinds of relief Indonesia will send to Nepal, as said by the President,' she said as quoted by Antara news agency.

A strong earthquake measuring 7.9 on the Richter scale shook Nepal on Saturday, devastating buildings, houses and infrastructure, killing more than 1,800 people and injuring more than 7,800 in Kathmandu, which has a population of around 1 million people. (rms)(++++)
