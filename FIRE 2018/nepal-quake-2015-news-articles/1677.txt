MANILA, Philippines â€” The military is ready to send a humanitarian team to earthquake-devastated Nepal when ordered to do so by the government.

Armed Forces chief Gen. Gregorio Catapang Jr. said they can deploy a platoon of soldiers to provide relief to the earthquake victims.

"In case we are ordered by our commander-in-chief, we are ready to send a delegation to Nepal to help them in their humanitarian relief operation," Catapang told reporters Monday in Camp Aguinaldo.

"It will depend on the request of the Nepalese government. We can send as much as maybe one platoon for humanitarian assistance and disaster response," he added.

Catapang clarified that there is no order yet from their civilian superiors to send troops to Nepal.

Defense Secretary Voltaire Gazmin said they are still studying how they can help the quake-hit South Asian country.

"You know that we have limited resources. We are still looking for ways to send our assistance," the defense chief told radio station dzRH.

Gazmin said agencies are regularly holding earthquake drills to improve the level of the country's preparedness. He said the National Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Council would meet to discuss preparedness and response measures in light of the deadly Nepal earthquake.

The death toll from last Saturday's magnitude 7.8 Nepal quake has risen to more than 3,000 as of Monday.

"The Department of National Defense of the Philippines wishes to express its profoundest sympathies to the people of Nepal, most especially, those who have lost loved ones to this disaster," Peter Galvez, the agency's spokesman, said in a statement.

"Our nation has experienced similar tragedies brought on by nature, which is why we feel very deeply for the victims of this earthquake," he added.
