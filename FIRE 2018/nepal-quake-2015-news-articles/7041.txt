County restaurant owner to help devastated Nepal with fundraiser
</headline>

<text>
For Crofton restaurateur Debendra Sapkota, Nepal was his home.

He spent his first 28 years there, growing up and attending high school and then college before coming to the United States at 27.

Sapkota, the owner of Namaste, an Indian restaurant in the Princess Shopping Center, saw the news of the latest quake on Tuesday morning and decided he had to do something.

The Glen Burnie resident is organizing a fundraiser on Sunday between noon and 4 p.m., with the proceeds going to help those in his home country. He's offering a special buffet (with wine) at $50 per person, $100 for three people, $150 for a group of four and $200 for a group of five or more.

He said he'll donate $32 out of every $50 to relief efforts in Nepal.

"I want to get as much as I can for those needy people," he said. "Whatever it comes to from the people who help me out. Anything would be appreciated."

He's trying to get the word out about the event with fliers and posts on the restaurant's Facebook page.

He hasn't slept very well since hearing the news of the second quake. The first quake, which devastated Nepal on April 25, has left more than 8,000 dead â€“ with the toll still rising. The aftershock struck Tuesday, about 50 miles east of the capital city of Katmandu, near the China border, just as people were beginning to dig out and return to some sense of normalcy. That blow has left at least 65 dead and more than 2,000 injured.

Sapkota heard the news on CNN over his morning cup of coffee. He tried to contact his mother there but couldn't get through. Eventually, he reached a neighbor and found out that his 80-year-old mother wasn't hurt.

"I would see the houses and the people dying there and the buildings 100 years old crumbling to the ground," he said. "I love Katmandu. I would always go there and hang out, have tea or coffee in the morning. It's a breathtaking place, and it's all lost."

Communication with those in his home country has been spotty. But those in his immediate family are all OK.

He has a brother and a sister in Katmandu, but they've fled the city to stay in their hometown of Ilam, a tiny village about 350 miles east of the country's most populous city. There, they've moved in with Sapkota's mother and his other brother.

"There, they are more safe," he said.

His sister Indu basically lost her home in the aftershock but was uninjured.

"It's all crumbled," he said. "They cannot get into their house. It's not demolished, but they cannot get in and stay there."

The fear, devastation and hardship in his native country inspired him to organize his fund-raiser.

"Thousands have died and many, many more are homeless," he said. "So, I wanted to do this."
