Two weeks ago, a group of four from the Chester Christian Church embarked on a journey that would forever change their lives.

Their goal was to do mission work by helping the people in Nepal. Little did they know their mission would soon shift after a devastating earthquake rocked the nation just after their plane landed.



Group leader Charlie Stephenson said, "We gathered together. In fact, right away we already comforting a lot of people as the earthquake was even happening."

After the group returned home, they shared pictures from the trip capturing the epicenter of turmoil in Nepal.



"First you stated hearing the rumbling, and then you were thinking this was probably just a low flying plane or something. But as it started shaking around and as the power started flicking, we were like, oh okay, we probably need to do something here and gather together," Stephenson said.



Despite the thousands of lives lost in that devastating earthquake in Nepal, the mission group at Chester Christian Church was able to come home safe to their families.



"For the most part we felt at peace and at ease with things because our God is in control of the world," Stephenson said.



The group was delayed getting to their goal destination, but they were able to lend a hand helping those who had lost everything in the quake.

Even though they are back home, their minds are with the people of a country struggling to get back on its feet.



"We just ask that you pray for the people there they are pretty much in total devastation in the town of Katmandu," Toby said



With their mission now complete, the four are all happy to be back with family, never hesitating to lend a hand to those near and far at a moments notice.
