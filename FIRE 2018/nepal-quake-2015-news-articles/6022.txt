Aftershocks: Lancaster restaurant workers search for Nepalese family and friends
</headline>

A Lancaster County rastaurant closed for several days so that workers could find their families after the earthquake in Nepal.

“We’ve been unable to open this restaurant because of that pain,” says Mohan Pradhan, owner of Himalayan Curry and Grill. “We’ve been, every night, every day thinking about them.”

Himalayan Curry and Grill reopened on Thursday. Its staff are from Kathmandu and different villages in Nepal. They’ve been trying to keep in contact as aftershocks have rocked the region.

“So many people lost their lives, so many people lost their whole houses, everything,” says Sarmila Shrestha at the restaurant. She’s from Kathmandu and located her family in the hours after the earthquake. “Only one friend I found, others, I don’t know where they are.”

All of the staff’s families have been found but many friends are still missing. The death toll has climbed to more than 6,000, with 13,000 injured. Experts say the death toll could rise to as many as 50,000.

The restaurant is planning to fundraise for Nepal, specifically looking to collect items like protein bars, painkillers, clothing and other things. To help, visit their Facebook page.
