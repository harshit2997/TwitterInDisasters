Global Rescue Engaged in Rescue Operations Following Nepal Earthquake
</headline>

<text>
BOSTON--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Following the worst earthquake to strike Nepal in almost a century Global Rescue, a worldwide provider of integrated medical, security, intelligence, travel risk management and crisis response services to enterprises, governments and individuals, is actively engaged on the ground conducting rescue operations for clients and members impacted by the tragedy.

The earthquake resulted in hundreds of deaths, injuries, and at least one reported avalanche on Mount Everest. The quake struck on Saturday shortly before noon local time with an epicenter approximately 50 miles from the capital of Kathmandu.

Global Rescue is deploying additional personnel to join its team already in Nepal for the Himalayan climbing season. Following the quake and avalanche, the company is communicating with and providing intelligence to clients and members in the region to ensure their safety and is actively coordinating air resources for evacuations.

“This tragedy is heartbreaking, particularly after the events of the 2014 climbing season,” said Dan Richards, CEO and founder of Global Rescue. “The scale of the disaster is very large and our operations teams are working around the clock to ensure the safety of our clients and extract those who need it to safety.”

Global Rescue’s trained personnel have been conducting rescue and evacuation missions in Nepal every season for more than a decade. Global Rescue typically performs dozens of helicopter evacuations in the Himalaya each year. The company regularly sends its medical and security teams, including former military special operations personnel, critical care paramedics and physicians, around the world to personally respond to members facing emergencies.
