<text>
In the wake of Saturday's massive earthquake, the Humane Society International (HSI) said its animal rescue team was on standby to be deployed in Nepal, whenever animal welfare groups in the Himalayan nation seek help.

The HSI, an organisation that works on animal protection issues around the world, said its disaster response team will work with the Animal Welfare Network Nepal to rescue animals in need and provide temporary shelter, as well as provide rescue vehicles and help reunite lost animals with their families.

"We will also help coordinate donations of supplies to animal shelters that are taking in animals because of the earthquake," the HSI said in a statement.

Rahul Sehgal, HSI's director for Asia, said: "Our entire animal rescue team has been put on standby to deploy at a moment's notice if our assistance is needed."
