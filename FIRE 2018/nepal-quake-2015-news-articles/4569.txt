(ANSA) - Kathmandu, April 29 - Some 200 protesters blocked traffic and clashed with police in the Nepalese capital of Kathmandu Wednesday, accusing the government of being too slow in distributing much-needed aid to its earthquake-devastated population. Also in the capital, clashes occurred when thousands thronged Kathmandu's bus stations in a bid to return to their home villages.

Overloaded buses are leaving with passengers perching on their roofs. In the Dolakha region, desperate homeless citizens set fire to district offices after they failed to receive any aid whatsoever since the 7.8 magnitude April 25 earthquake, which is feared to have left as many as 10,000 dead. District chief Prem Lal Lamichhane confirmed the interior ministry has not sent any aid yet, La Repubblica newspaper reported.
