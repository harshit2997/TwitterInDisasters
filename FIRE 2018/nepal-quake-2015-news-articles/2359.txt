Devastation in Nepal, as the death toll rises to over 3,700.

A huge earthquake ripped through the country on Saturday.



10 Hampshire firefighters flew to it's capital Kathmandu last night (Sunday 26th April).



They are part of a 60 person UK International Search and Rescue team.



The team took with them 11 tonnes of kit, including torches, stretchers and search cameras.



Over 6,000 people are thought to be injured.



Many are sleeping on the streets as their homes have been destroyed.

We are getting reports that a Farnham family who live in Nepal, have survived the earthquake.

Aftershocks are still rippling through the area, holding up rescue operations.

The earthquake was the worst to hit the South Asian nation in more than 80 years.

In the wake of the earthquake, an avalanche swept through the Mount Everest base camp. From this 18 people have been confirmed dead.



It is feared the number dead may rise, as the search teams move into more rural places near the epicentre.



Ben Pickering is from Save the Children, he says little is known at the moment about what the situation is like there:

"This is a rural area, north west of Kathmandu. We simply can't access that area. The real concern is there are many people affected by this earthquake that we don't know about, we simply don't know what their needs are."

On Twitter, Deputy Chief Officer of Hampshire Fire and Rescue, Neil Odin wrote:

"Proud Deputy chief today seeing off the @Hants_fire contingent to assist in Nepal. Great team @UKISAR."

The Foreign Office has advised that any British Nationals in need of consular assistance call +44 (0) 207 008 0000 or text NEPAL to +447860010026.
