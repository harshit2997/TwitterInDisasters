BANGKOK, 26 April 2015 – Prime Minister Gen Prayut Chan-o-cha says the government is closely monitoring the earthquake situation in Nepal while full-scale assistance has been provided to Thai nationals.

The Prime Minister mentioned the assistance before leaving the military airfield in Don Muang, Bangkok, to attend the 26th ASEAN Summit 2015 in Kuala Lumpur.

Gen Prayut said the government has prepared teams of medical volunteers including members of the Central Institute of Forensic Science to help survivors of the quake. Moreover, the Thai government will donate money and about 300-500 tonnes of rice to the earthquake victims.

He cited a preliminary report by the Foreign Ministry as saying that around 30 Thai students and workers had been helped by the Thai Embassy in Kathmandu and all of them were safe.

While in Malaysia, Gen Prayut will attend the 26th ASEAN Summit 2015 in Kuala Lumpur and the 9th Indonesia-Malaysia-Thailand Growth Triangle Leaders’ Summit in Langkawi. He will return to Thailand on Tuesday, 28 April.
