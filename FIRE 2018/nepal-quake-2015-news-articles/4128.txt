Faridabad govt dispatches relief material for earthquake victims in Nepal
</headline>

<text>
As India continues its support to its calamity-struck neighbour, deputy commissioner of Faridabad, Amit Kumar, on Thursday flagged off trucks carrying relief materials such as medicines, food packets, packaged water bottles and clothes. He also urged everybody to extend help to Nepal’s earthquake victims.

The relief materials were arranged and packed by the district’s Red Cross Society office.

Amit Kumar said that the Red Cross Society has already sent a fleet of trucks carrying relief materials to Nepal. But people are yet to be rescued and food and water is scarce, so we are sending relief materials again.

It was learnt that quake victims, especially in rural Nepal are furious over the pace of relief work. They say that they haven’t received food or medicine.

Nepal authorities have said that the earthquake has killed over 6,000 and injured at least 11,000 people.
