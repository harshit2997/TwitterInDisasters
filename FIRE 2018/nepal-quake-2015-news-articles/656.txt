The devastation of the earthquake in Nepal is certainly being felt in Rhode Island.

The devastation of the earthquake in Nepal is certainly being felt in Rhode Island. Om Davkota, the president of the Nepalese Association of Rhode Island owns the Brickway on Wickenden restaurant in Providence and called an emergency meeting with members of his community Saturday night to see just what they can do to help those victims in the homeland.

"They've been hysterical," says Davkota. "Emotions are running really high. They've been scared."

Davkota recalls a frantic phone call from his parents in Nepal Saturday morning. They are ok, but they lost everything in the 7.8 magnitude earthquake that hit the country.

"It's been very emotional," Davkota tells NBC 10. "My sister's here, my wife is here. It's been very tough."

It has certainly been tough on the hundreds of local Nepalese that call the region home because they say it's the start of the rainy season in their home country. They worry about all those survivors still without shelter or warmth as the rain begins to pour down.

"We're scared," says Roshan Baral, whose parents survived the earthquake in Nepal. "We have a lot of flooding, and because of the earthquake, nobody's inside their home right now."

Nepal is a relatively poor country that relies heavily on agriculture and tourism. The earthquake has abruptly stopped both industries.

"No food. No clean water. No electricity. They cannot go inside the house. I don't think it can get any worse than that," says Saramsh Pandit.

The harsh reality is exacerbated by difficulty communicating with loved ones because cell towers in Nepal have been destroyed. Members of the Nepalese community in Rhode Island are taking it upon themselves to raise money to send to their home country as it tries to dig out of the devastation.

"Our biggest priority for now is to get money and think about it, like who needs what?" says Pandit. "For example, tents, or clean water, or food, or something."

To help the people of Nepal as they get through these difficult times, you can donated to the Nepalese Association of Rhode Island's GoFundMe site.
