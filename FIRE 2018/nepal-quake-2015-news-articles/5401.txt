Raj Anthony was on holiday in India before splitting from his group of friends to head for Nepal.

PETALING JAYA: Authorities in Nepal believe they have found the body of Malaysian national Raj Anthony amidst the rubble left by the devastating earthquake that hit the South Asian country on April 28.

The body was found in the badly hit Langtang Valley, about 130km north of Kathmandu. It had Anthony’s passport on it.

The 38-year-old Anthony, an award winning disc jockey, was on a six-month holiday in the Indian subcontinent. He was with friends in India before splitting from the group to go to Nepal.

All communications with him were lost about four days before the 7.8 magnitude earthquake hit Nepal.

In his last Facebook posting, he said he was planning to trek up the mountains from April 21 to April 28.

The Star quoted a Nepal police official as saying that the body would be taken to a teaching hospital in the town of Maharajgunj.

The paper said Anthony’s brother was scheduled to arrive in Nepal today to identify the body.

It quoted a Malaysian embassy official in Kathmandu as saying the mission would help Anthony’s family in arranging for the body to be flown back to Malaysia.
