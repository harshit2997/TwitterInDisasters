In a regular press briefing, the official said that the airlines that will aid in bringing the Chinese citizens home will include Air China, Sichuan Airlines, China Eastern Airlines and China Southern Airlines.



Meanwhile, China has also committed another round of humanitarian assistance to Nepal amounting to 40 million yuan, as announced by the country's Ministry of Commerce.



Hong said that the government will be providing first aid kits, tents and blankets, and water purification equipment.



On Sunday, the government pledged its first round of aid to Nepal, which is worth 20 million yuan. The assistance will include blankets, tents and generators.



Hong also said that two cargo planes prepared by China's Red Cross Society have carried 600 of the tents that will be donated.



Apart from this, the Chinese government has also sent a medical team composed of 60 practitioners and experts. Along with them are 20 tons of disease prevention supplies for the earthquake victims.



To date, Nepal has tallied an approximate 5,000 deaths after the massive earthquake and its aftershocks. Meanwhile, injuries have numbered up to around 10,000.



The Himalayan earthquake struck the east-southeastern area of Lamjung, Nepal, on April 25. The 7.8-magnitude quake could claim as high as 15,000 lives, according to Gen. Gaurav Rana, the country's army chief and rescue efforts head.
