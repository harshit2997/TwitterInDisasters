The first medical team sent by the Chinese government to quake-striken Nepal has now returned home.



The 58-strong team arrived back in the city of Chengdu Saturday evening, after 13 days helping to treat survivors of the earthquake. It was the first foreign medical team to arrive in Nepal in the days following the quake. It was reported to have treated more than 600 people, including more than 100 seriously injured, and carried out more than 200 operations.



Many of the team had experience working in the aftermath of the huge earthquake in China's Sichuan province in 2008.
