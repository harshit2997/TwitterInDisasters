Ivoclar Vivadent has announced that it will be making a donation of funds to assist relief efforts following the recent devastating earthquakes in Nepal.

The company has pledged 100,000 Swiss francs (69,370 pounds) for immediate aid to the Liechtenstein Red Cross, which is helping the survivors in Nepal to recover after the 7.8 magnitude quake that struck on April 25th.

“Ivoclar Vivadent has provided 100,000 Swiss francs for emergency relief and assistance following the recent earthquakes in Nepal.“

More than 7,000 people are estimated to have died as a result of the earthquake, which was the strongest to hit the Himalayan region in more than 80 years. It has also done severe damage to the infrastructure of one of the poorest countries in the world.
