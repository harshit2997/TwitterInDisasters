The family of U.S. Marine from Arizona who was on a helicopter that disappeared in Nepal this week during a rescue mission is awaiting word on his fate.

Nepalese rescuers early Friday located the wreckage and found three bodies nearby.

The chopper carried six Marines, including Jake Hug from Arizona, and two Nepalese army soldiers. Hopes for any survivors was waning, according to Nepal's defense secretary.

Chris Counts is Hug's cousin. His family is having a hard time watching the news these days as the search continued for Hug's helicopter that vanished in Nepal on Tuesday.

"Out of all the bases, and all the military people there are, your cousin happens to be on the one helicopter that's gone missing," Counts said.

Hug and the other U.S. Marines were taking part in a disaster relief mission, providing food and supplies to thousands of victims of this week's massive earthquakes in Nepal.

The helicopter reportedly disappeared without sending a distress signal.

"They said there is no smoke and no fire," Counts said."The helicopter is probably below the tree line, so it can't be seen from the air. The area the helicopter is in is real mountainous and woody, and you can't get a signal beacon out."

Counts described his cousin as a good guy with a goofy sense of humor.

After graduating from Goldwater High School in Phoenix, Hug decided he wanted to make a difference in his life and joined the Marines.

"When somebody reads a book about your life you want it to sound interesting, something worth reading," Counts said. "I think Jake had that same mind set."

Hug's family still lives in the Valley and are all holding out hope that Hug and the other Marines are OK.

Counts said that not knowing what happened is hardest on Hug's mom.

"She hasn't slept, hasn't eaten and is constantly waiting," Counts said. "She is told not to watch the news, but you can't help it because you want to hear or see something."

"We're staying hopeful and praying and hoping he's found safely," Counts said.
