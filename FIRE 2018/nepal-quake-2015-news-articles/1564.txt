Members of both houses of State Legislature on Monday have unanimously decided to contribute their one month’s salary for relief work in Nepal.

Some members even suggested that a portion of the local area development funds allocated to each member could also be donated to the relief fund.

In Legislative Assembly, Deputy Speaker N.H. Shivashankara Reddy moved the obituary reference and expressed deep grief over the death of over 2,500 people in the earthquake in Nepal and north Indian states.

Revenue Minister V. Srinivas Prasad has urged members of the Lower House to come forward to donate their month’s salary as well as funds from the Local Area Development Fund. Leader of the Opposition Jagadish Shettar agreed to the suggestion.

In the Legislative Council, Chairman D.H. Shankaramurthy moved the obituary reference. Minister S.R. Patil, Leader of the Opposition K.S. Eshwarappa and V.S. Ugrappa of the Congress spoke and expressed grief over the tragedy.

As a mark of respect to the departed souls, a minutes silence was observed in both houses.
