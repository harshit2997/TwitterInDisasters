KATHMANDU, Nepal (WRIC) â€” Four members of Chester Christian Church were on their way to Nepal for a missionary trip. Minutes after their arrival on April 25, a massive 7.8 magnitude earthquake hit and has devastated the area.

Reports received so far by aid groups suggest that many communities perched on mountainsides are devastated or struggling to cope. As many as 3,300 were reported dead, according to the Associated Press. That number has been quickly climbing.

The disaster has changed the course of the mission trip for the group. Now, members of the Chester Christian Church are contributing to relief efforts.

Stay tuned for more on this developing story.
