SEOUL, May 4 (Yonhap) -- A top South Korean university said Monday it has sent relief goods to a Nepalese hospital to help with the earthquake relief operations.

Seoul National University said it has donated 600 water filters to the Kathmandu University hospital in the Nepalese capital, along with Scientists and Engineers Without Borders, a Seoul-based non-profit organization.

A magnitude-7.9 earthquake hit Nepal last month, killing more than 7,000 people.

SNU's medical college has also donated medical supplies, and SNU students are collecting donations and other relief goods to be sent to the quake-hit nation.

SNU said it plans to send volunteers to Kathmandu University this winter to help rebuild its library and laboratories affected by the earthquake.

SNU signed a memorandum of agreement with the Nepalese university in 2010 to establish a student exchange program. Currently, 13 Kathmandu University students are studying at SNU.
