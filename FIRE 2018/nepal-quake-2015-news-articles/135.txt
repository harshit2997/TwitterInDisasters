Around 250 Indians are being evacuated from Nepal on Saturday night after a 7.9-magnitude earthquake hit the Himalayan nation claiming over 1,000 lives.

"We are sending around 250 Indians by one one plane tonight," India's ambassador to Nepal Ranjit Rae told IANS over phone on Saturday.

"The toll in Nepal has crossed 1,000 now," he added.

Asked about Indian casualties, he said it was difficult to give exact figures as the phone lines were down and it was tough to contact the proper authorities.

"I can confirm only two Indian deaths now -- one in the embassy and one in a hospital," Rae said, adding that embassy officials have been dispatched to hotels and hospitals.

He said the embassy was in touch with some Indians stranded in Muktinath and Jomsom.

He said India has sent four planes carrying National Disaster Rescue Force (NDRF) personnel.

Sniffer dogs, equipment for removal of rubble and medical aid have also been sent by New Delhi.
