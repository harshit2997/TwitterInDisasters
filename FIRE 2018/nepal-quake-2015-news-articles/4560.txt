SEOUL, April 29 (Yonhap) -- South Korea announced plans Wednesday to dispatch 44 more rescue workers and medics, along with two sniffer dogs, to Nepal which was ravaged by a 7.8 magnitude earthquake.

The decision would raise the size of the Korea Disaster Response Team (KDRT) to 54.

The first group of 10 members from the KDRT arrived in Nepal Tuesday and immediately began operations in Bhaktapur, about 15 kilometers east of Kathmandu.

Another batch of 15 search and rescue workers and 15 medics will head to Nepal on Friday, said the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.

The rescue team will also operate in Bhaktapur and the medics will work at the Nepal-Korea Friendship Hospital in Thimi on a mission to last about 10 days, it said.

"Ten other medics and two administrative staffers will then be dispatched as well for rotation," a ministry official told reporters. Thousands of people were reportedly killed in the Saturday quake.

South Korea plans to provide Nepal with US$1 million in initial humanitarian aid, half of which will be a direct delivery of emergency materials and the rest through the United Nations.

South Korea, meanwhile, decided to fly a special passenger plane to help its nationals in Nepal return home quickly.

The 261-seat jet is to leave for the Nepalese capital on early Thursday morning and fly back here in the evening, according to the ministry. Around 650 South Koreans reside in the Himalayan country visited by many tourists.

South Korea's lawmakers said they plan to pass a resolution on aiding Nepal during a Thursday session.
