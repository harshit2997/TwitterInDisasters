Mercy Corps, Medical Teams International crews face storms, blocked roads as they provide aid in Nepal
</headline>

<text>
Nearly four days after a 7.8-magnitude earthquake shook Nepal and neighboring countries, two Portland-based humanitarian agencies are on the ground. Workers from Mercy Corps and Medical Teams International say they will build on their existing work in the South Asian country as they try to reach those stranded in remote villages.

Mercy Corps workers on Tuesday said they face mounting obstacles as they try to help the millions affected by the disaster.

Storms and mudslides have closed roads, blocking aid workers from reaching the remote villages that need them most, the agency reports. Workers in Nepal have heard that hill villages and terrace farms have been destroyed. Survivors' livelihoods have, too: Cattle have been crushed or smothered inside barn structures.

Even in Nepal's capital, Kathmandu, many are sleeping outside without access to safe drinking water. Toilets are clogged from overuse, workers report. Women have no feminine toiletry supplies.

Mercy Corps teams are distributing kits that include toothpaste, toothbrushes, clothing and cooking utensils. The humanitarian organization has had a team of workers in Nepal since 2006; about 90 of its workers are there now. Several of those workers have lost their homes, spokeswoman Amy Fairbairn said in a statement, yet they continue to work to help their neighbors survive.

More than 5,000 have been confirmed dead at the latest count. The quake and its aftershocks have crumbled homes, buildings and temples and triggered avalanches on Mt. Everest.

"We're working closely with youth clubs and police departments to find the hardest hit

areas and identify the families with the greatest need," Fairbairn said.

Medical Teams International, another Portland-area organization, plans to send medical volunteers to Nepal on Wednesday morning. They'll join the nonprofit's global emergency and security adviser Dominic Bowen, who flew to Nepal over the weekend. Bowen, who has been sleeping outside in the rain, is there to deliver medical care and supplies to victims.

Medical Teams International will work to the west of Kathmandu, close to the earthquake's epicenter, where few resources exist. The aid organization began working in Nepal in February and so already has partner organizations in those villages.

"We know the region needs medical support teams and supplies to treat victims," Medical Teams International president and CEO Jeff Pinneo said in a statement. "We're responding immediately."

Both Portland-area organizations need donations to continue the work. Contributions can be made on their websites.
