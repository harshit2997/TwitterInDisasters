I love studying history, particularly the Roman Republic, ancient Greece and the First French Empire. My other interests include jogging, playing chess and watching documentaries. There’s not a subject I’m not interested in and I love my job. I’m always available for a chat especially over a wine or coffee.

MOUNT Everest climber Alyssa Azar is still trapped at Base Camp following a major earthquake which shook Nepal.

Alyssa and her fellow climbers can't do much but wait to find out how they can get off the mountain.

Half of the camp was wiped out by a massive avalanche.

Her father Glenn Azar said getting off the mountain could take some time as Nepal was facing a national emergency.

"The country doesn't have the resources and there's nothing wrong with them, so they'll have to wait," he said.

"They're pretty safe up there unless more earthquakes hit."

There have been 18 deaths and 50 injuries at Base Camp.

"She's far from out of the woods, but they have nowhere else to be," Mr Azar said.

He said Alyssa had been in that kind of situation before.

She was on the mountain last year when an avalanche killed 13 Sherpa guides.

"She's been travelling to Nepal for the last 8 ½ years and alone since she was 15-years-old.

"Alyssa is feeling physically and mentally strong."

Mr Azar is contemplating flying to Nepal, but said he didn't want to "get in the way".

Once Alyssa gets off the mountain she will head back to Toowoomba.

She has another climb in Russia planned in September.

Mr Azar said it was unclear whether Alyssa was lucky or unlucky after being present at two disasters on Mt Everest.

"Twice in a row she's been involved in the worst incident ever but both times she has survived."

He urged residents to support the Nepal aid appeals if possible.

Glenn Azar has maintained contact with his daughter Alyssa through text messages. Bev Lacey
