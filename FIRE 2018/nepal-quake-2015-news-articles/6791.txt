Remote Kavre VDCs sans relief

As Food Corporation depots in Kavre have run out of food stuff, earthquake victims in a number of remote VDCs in the district have been deprived of relief materials since the past three days.

The shortage of food has been further escalated as even private sector organisations have stopped going to the villages following the major aftershock on Tuesday.

Apart from a few cartons of noodles and biscuits and 250 sacks of beaten rice, the depots does not have any other food supplies.

“We have not received any large quantities of relief since the past three days and even those that trickle in run out immediately,” said store Pralhad Pyakurel, chief at the Nepal Food Corporation, who is also overseeing the distribution of relief materials.

Admitting that relief materials sent to the district were way less than demanded, Local Development Officer Chiranjibi Timilsina said that the government relief was inadequate while private organisations have not been able to reach the villages fearing another major aftershock.

According to Chief District Officer and coordinator of the District Disaster Management Committee, quake victims in Kavre have received 262 metric tonnes of rice, 51,600 kgs of beaten rice and 19, 086 sets of tents in relief. However, the relief materials that have reached the villages through the DDMC have been inadequate.

Similarly, only five sets of tents have reached Chalalganesthan VDC where 400 houses have been destroyed completely. Likewise, 80 tents and 450 kgs of rice have reached Kavre VDC.

According to planning officer Santosh Pokhrel, geographical remoteness, lack of transportation and inadequate relief materials is the reason why remote villages in the district have been deprived of the much-needed relief materials.

He said that due to difficult geographic terrain, relief materials were sent to the VDCs in Nepal Army helicopters in the first phase.

Meanwhile, relief materials comprising 247 sacks of rice sent to the remote villages under the responsibility of VDC Secretary Uttam Prasad Timilsina, District Health Post In-charge Chandra Bahadur Lungeli and representative of UCPN (Maoists) district chapter Jiwan Ghising has gone missing halfway.
