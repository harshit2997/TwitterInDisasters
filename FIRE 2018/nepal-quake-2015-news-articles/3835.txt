ROUND ROCK, Texas -- A Round Rock family is sleeping a little better after receiving a highly anticipated phone call Tuesday night.

"I'm not sleeping. I mean I can't sleep," said Jeanne Toewe.

Toewe's sister Joanne Long is part of a 15-person group of artists, including nine Americans, who were in Katmandu when a Magnitude 7.8 earthquake hit April 25.

The last time Long's family had heard from her was through a text message she sent her daughter shortly after the quake.

"It was getting dark and they had no shelter and no food and they were, and she just said that she loved her, and that was the last message she got from her mother," said Toewe.

Towards the end of KVUE's interview with Toewe, her husband answered the phone. It was a family member who said they had just received a text from Long saying that she was tired and hungry but okay.

"This is the first glimmer of hope that we've had since Saturday.I feel a little bit of relief. I'm going to be positive," said Toewe.

The Round Rock family is working with the phone company trying to figure out exactly when Long's text was sent.

A spokesperson with the American Red Cross advises people wanting to help with the Nepal relief effort to donate money to a reputable organization that was already in Nepal before the quake hit.
