Thai public warned about Nepal quake donation scams

BANGKOK: Charitable individuals in Thailand may have been duped by con-artists planning to get rich quick off of the back of the earthquake in Nepal, which has left thousands of people dead.



Thai police warned on Thursday (Apr 29) of a number of unofficial bank account numbers, not linked to charities, circulating online encouraging donations to help aid the relief effort in disaster-hit Nepal.



“The public should donate money to accounts set up by government agencies because there are many public organisations and NGOs all doing the same thing. The police understand their intentions but this creates an opportunity for criminals to take advantage of the situation.” said Royal Thai Police Spokesman Pol Col Krisana Pattanacharoen.



Siam Commercial Bank was forced to post a message on their official Facebook account warning people that the bank's graphics had been doctored to encourage donations to a another, unknown account number.



Thai Police responded by setting up a hotline that concerned citizens can contact to verify account details. They are also encouraging the public to donate money to a specified government account under the name Thai Hearts to Nepal.

Anyone that suspects they may have been scammed has been asked to keep as much evidence as possible to help with any future legal action.



A number of Thais were caught in the earthquake and Thailand’s military government helped to facilitate their evacuation by sending C130 planes to airlift them home. By Thursday, about 80 Thai nationals had returned safely from Kathmandu.



The government also sent a team of medical experts to asses the situation, and will consider sending a bigger team at a future date.



Thailand has been sending a steady stream of financial to Nepal, with local businesses and television networks joining in the efforts.



Thailand’s King and Queen donated 10,000,000THB (US$305,000), while the military government passed a cabinet resolution to send 100,000,000THB (US$3,050,000) in aid money to support relief efforts.
