DENVER - Three Colorado hikers in Nepal say they narrowly escaped death when a massive earthquake hit the country on Saturday.

7NEWS’ Kristen Skovira spoke to one of the men in Kathmandu who said he was trekking in the Langtang Valley at the time of the 7.8-magnitude quake.

Hiker Vance Watt said he is safe and staying at a hotel, along with his brother Jim Watt and their friend Greg Davenport. Jim Watt broke his leg and had to be airlifted out.



Watt posted pictures online, just moments after the earthquake struck Nepal. At the time of the quake, the three men were hiking in the valley very close to the quake’s epicenter.

Watt said the guys had no idea what was happening at first and says the ground felt like a water-bed under their feet.

"It was almost like the hill came alive and these rocks from both sides were rolling down. At that point I think instinct took just took over and I ducked behind the rock and everyone else followed me," Watt said.
