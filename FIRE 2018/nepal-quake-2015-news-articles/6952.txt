Architect student Matt Carapiet, 23, from Kent, was on a gap year when he went trekking in the Himalayas. The village he was thought to be staying in, Langtang, was almost completely wiped out by an avalanche caused by the devastating earthquake earlier last month. Last night, the Foreign Office confirmed he had died. Mr Carapiet's devastated parents Jill, 55, and Greg, 56, and sister Christina, 25, posted a message on the Facebook page 'Bring Matt Carapiet Home', set up when they originally appealed for help to find him. They said: "Matt was a much-loved son, brother, grandson and nephew. "He also had a caring group of friends, who all have precious memories of how kind, happy, creative and brilliant he was. He made a huge impression on the lives of everyone he met.

"Matt was touring Asia in a gap year before planning to continue his architecture studies in the autumn. "He spoke to us regularly about how much he was enjoying his travels and we know he was doing something that he loved. He had been trekking in Nepal for two weeks before the earthquake." The family had not heard from Mr Carapiet, from Bearsted, near Maidstone, since April 20 and were frantically worried when the earthquake hit on April 25. Two Gurkha soldiers were sent to Langtang to search for him. However, they found just one building was left standing in the village, a popular stop-off point for trekkers, following the disaster. A total of 55 guest houses were wiped out by the avalanche. Survivors collected the bodies of villagers, workers and tourists. They carefully covered them and lined them up into groups for identification.
