Another Big Earthquake Rocks Nepal

Nepal's Home Ministry has raised the death toll from the latest quake to at least 42, while saying another 1,117 people had been injured.

The magnitude-7.3 quake hit hardest in remote mountain districts northeast of the capital of Nepal, terrifying a nation already shell-shocked by a more powerful quake on April 25 that killed more than 8,000 and flattened entire villages.

Information was slow to reach the capital after Tuesday's quake, but officials and aid workers said they expected the death toll to almost certainly rise.

The Health Ministry said rescuers had managed to pull three people to safety in the capital, while another nine were rescued in the district of Dolkha.

The quake has also caused at least one death in the neighboring country of Tibet.

According to China's state broadcaster China Central Television, the quake triggered a landslide that killed one and injured three others.
