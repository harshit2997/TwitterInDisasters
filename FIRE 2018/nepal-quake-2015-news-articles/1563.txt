Led by Nepali Students Association, several Bengalureans are coming forward to collect funds and relief materials and lend a helping hand for the victims of the massive Himalayan earthquake.

Fifty Nepali students of nursing colleges in Karnataka are ready to leave for Nepal to help victims there. To collect funds, around 500 Nepali students participated in a procession here on Sunday.

Asim Giri, president of the association, said, “We are waiting for permission from the governments.” He said there were 10,000 students and 3,000 working professionals from Nepal in Karnataka.

Meanwhile, Archbishop of Bengaluru Bernard Moras said a special goodwill collection would be made on May 3 in all churches and institutions across the State. This will be monitored by the Karnataka Region Catholic Bishops Council and All-Karnataka United Christian Forum for Human Rights.
