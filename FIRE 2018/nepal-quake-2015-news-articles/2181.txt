SEOUL, April 27 (Yonhap) -- South Korea said Monday it will send a search and rescue team to Nepal devastated by a massive earthquake.

A five-member advance team will soon head to Nepal, an official at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs said.

Seoul plans to send more rescue workers, said the official, adding the exact size and timing of the dispatch will be decided at a government-civilian meeting to be chaired by Vice Foreign Minister Cho Tae-yul later in the day.

South Korea has pledged US$1 million in initial humanitarian aid for the Himalayan nation.

Thousands of people were reportedly killed by the 7.8-magnitude weekend quake. Three South Koreans were also injured, according to the ministry.

Citing continued aftershocks, the ministry advised South Koreans not to travel to Nepal and leave the country if possible.

It elevated the level of a travel warning for the nation by one notch.

Gyeonggi Gov. Nam Kyung-pil, meanwhile, offered condolences to victims and promised $200,000 in assistance.

In a letter to Kathmandu Mayor Purna Bhakta Tandukar, Nam conveyed a message of sympathy to the Nepalese people on behalf of residents in his province. The capital city is the hardest-hit area.

Gyeonggi Province, situated next to Seoul, has maintained close ties with Nepal through the official development assistance (ODA) program.
