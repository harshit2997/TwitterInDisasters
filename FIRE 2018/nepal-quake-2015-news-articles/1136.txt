Casino woman missing after Nepal earthquake – Echonetdaily

<text>
A 25-year-old Casino woman remains among the hundreds missing following an earthquake in Nepal.

Ngaire Seccombe, a former student at St Mary’s High School, was five days into a trek with a friend, Athena Zelandonii, a 25-year-old Brisbane photojournalist, when the earthquake struck.

Ms Seccombe’s name is among hundreds listed on a website managed by the International Committee of the Red Cross.

Her parents, John and Louise Seccombe of Backmede, could not be contacted for comment.

According to the site, Ms Seccomne and her friend last made contact on 20 April, and their address before the earthquake was listed as the Langtang Valley.

Langtang Valley is the nearest Himalayan Region from Kathmandu valley, a few hours drive from Kathmandu.

Langtang region is one of the most popular trekking regions for those wishing a short trek from Kathmandu into the Himalayas.

Prime Minister Tony Abbott has urged people to keep trying to contact relatives who have travelled to Nepal.

Saturday’s 7.8-magnitude quake in Nepal killed more than 2500 people, the worst disaster to hit the impoverished Himalayan nation in more than 80 years.

Mr Abbott said a lot of people out trekking would be difficult to contact and people should phone the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade if they could not get in touch with their loved ones.
