Kasargod, Apr 28: In a sad turn of events, it is now learnt that the young doctor from Kasargod who had gone missing in Nepal and was later reported to be safe, has in fact died.

Dr Irshad (26) and another medico, Dr Deepak Thomas from Kannur, have been confirmed dead, sources said.

Dr Irshad from Anebagilu, Kasargod, had been pursuing post-graduation in medicine Shimla, Himachal Pradesh. He along with Dr Deepak and Dr Abin Surya from Wayanad went to Nepal a few days ago and were supposed to return in a week. The hotel where they were staying had collapsed in the earthquake, injuring Dr Deepak and Dr Abin, while Dr Irshad had gone missing.

The next day it was reported that Dr Irshad was alive, but it is now learnt that someone had called his family to say that he was safe, but in fact, another person had been mistaken for Dr Irshad. The family had been restless as Dr Irshad himself had not called home.

Dr Irshad's brother Liyaqat who resides in Dubai went to Kathmandu and identified his body, it is learnt. Dr Deepak's body was also identified by his family members, it is said. Their identity cards were also found, sources said.

The bodies are in the mortuary of a hospital in Kathmandu.

Dr Irshad had completed his MBBS in Kozhikode in 2012 and after working in a hospital at Wayanad for sometime, had got MD seat in Shimla. His wedding was scheduled to be held this July. All three - Dr Irshad, Dr Deepak and Dr Abin were pursuing MD in the same college.

Preparations are under way to bring the mortal remains back to thei hometowns, family sources said.
