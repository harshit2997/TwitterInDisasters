BANGKOK, April 27 (Xinhua) -- Thai King Bhumibol Adulyadej has extended condolences to Nepal over a massive earthquake, which has killed more than 3,800 people.

"The Queen and I are deeply distressed by reports of the devastating earthquake which caused immense loss of human lives, casualties and destruction of cultural heritage and infrastructure in your country," the king said in a letter addressed to Nepalese President Ram Baran Yadav, which was released on Monday.

"We wish to extend our sincerest sympathy and condolences to Your Excellency and through you to all those who have suffered loss and bereavement in this natural disaster," the letter said.

A 7.9-magnitude earthquake jolted Nepal on Saturday, leaving at least 3,815 people dead and 7,046 others injured.

The Thai government has donated 200,000 U.S. dollars to Nepal to help victims, Suwat Jiraphan, deputy permanent secretary for the Foreign Ministry, was quoted by the Nation newspaper as saying.

In addition, the Thai Red Cross and the Public Health Ministry will send medical personnel, PM's Office Minister ML Panadda Diskul reportedly said, adding the Commerce Ministry will donate rice.

The armed forces are also sending military doctors and aircraft to Nepal, according to Deputy Prime Minister and Defense Minister Prawit Wongsuwon.
