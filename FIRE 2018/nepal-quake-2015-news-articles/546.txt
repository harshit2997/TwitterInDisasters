“Our thoughts are with the people of Nepal and neighbouring countries in the aftermath of the earthquake that has struck the Kathmandu Valley. On behalf of the Government and people of South Africa, I send my deepest condolences to the Government of Nepal and to everyone affected, particularly to the families and friends of those killed and injured,” said President Zuma in a statement on Sunday.

The SA High Commission in Colombo, Sri Lanka, was in contact with authorities in Nepal and on standby to assist South African nationals, the presidency said.

AP reported that over 1,900 people were reported dead on Sunday after a 7.8 magnitude earthquake hit the Asian country the previous day.

The quake was centered outside Kathmandu, the capital, and was the worst to hit the nation in over 80 years. It destroyed swaths of the oldest neighborhoods of Kathmandu, and was strong enough to be felt all across parts of India, Bangladesh, China’s region of Tibet and Pakistan.

Out of the 1,900, at least 721 of them died in Kathmandu alone, and the number of injured nationwide was upward of 5,000.
