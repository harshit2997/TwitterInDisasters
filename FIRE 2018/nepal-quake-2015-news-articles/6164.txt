KANPUR: A team of IIT-Kanpur experts and students returned to the city on Sunday after a week-long trip of quake-hit areas in Nepal and in UP and Bihar. Headed by earthquake engineer at IIT-K Prof Durgesh Rai, the team studied the devastation in the Himalayan nation.Besides Prof Rai, other team members were Vaibhav Singhal and research students Bhushan Raj and Lalit Sagar. They undertook a reconnaissance survey of the earthquake affected regions. Prof Rai and Vaibhav informed that they started their trip from Kanpur and went to Lucknow, Faizabad, Basti, Gonda, Gorakhpur and then went to north Bihar districts like Sitamarhi, Madhubani and headed to different regions in Nepal to study the affects of the quake."The magnitude 7.9 earthquake of April 25 had badly affected regions in Kathmandu, Bhaktapur, Nuwakot, Sindhupalchok, Dhading and Gorkha," said Prof Rai. He said the old masonry in Nepal suffered the worst damage. Also buildings made on thin pillars suffered damage. He said that it was perplexing that a majority of buildings lacked earthquake resistant features.Prof Rao said that in old town of Bhaktapur, several unreinforced masonry buildings which were still used as residential structures had suffered maximum damage. The general damage to buildings and other structures went well with the intensity of ground shaking observed at various places, with the maximum of IX at Kathmandu, VIII at Bhaktapur and Lalitpur and VI in and around Sitamarhi in Bihar.He said historic buildings suffered varying degrees of damage and temples and heritage structures which survived need to be safeguarded against future tremors. Prof Rai, who is also the coordinator of National Information Centre for Earth Engineering (NICEE), IIT Kanpur, said: "The current event provides an opportunity to assess the existing seismic risk in the adjoining Indian regions which fall in the highest seismic zone V and the next severe zone IV in the event of a large Himalayan earthquake."
