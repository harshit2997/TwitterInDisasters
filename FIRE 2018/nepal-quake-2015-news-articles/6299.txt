Family Of Australian Man Missing In Nepal, Now In A Desperate DNA Search
</headline>

<text>
Family members of an Australian man missing after Nepal earthquake is hoping to find him through DNA samples. The 44-year-old man named Tyronne White has been on the missing list for more than two weeks since the first earthquake hit the country.

White’s father and brother are then set to fly to Nepal, bringing with them DNA samples to hopefully ease the search. This will be done after a visit to the Federal Police department in Adelaide first, said Ms. White, the mother of Tyronne.

Tyronne had been travelling for three years and was last seen in a village called Langtang, which was reported to have been notably destroyed following the 7.8 magnitude earthquake on April 25. In addition, the hostels and lodges in the said area were said to have flattened. Hundreds of trekkers were killed and the search operations were not able to result in satisfactory outcomes.

The greatest fear of the family is that Tyronne might still be buried beneath the debris. Furthermore, they are bracing themselves for the worst as village was said to have suffered a massive landslide. "I'm just worried that he's going to stay on the missing list forever," Ms White told 7News. "They've had more Earth tremors, they had to pull everybody out, it just got worse." She said that she is keeping her hopes up but it is taking too long.

The White family, who last spoke with Tyronne on April 7, which is his mum’s birthday, also expressed dismay against the Foreign Affairs. However, minister Julie bishop said in a statement that their office had been providing help to the family whilst in Australia, and will continuously lend assistance to them as the father and the brother of Tyronne fly to Nepal.
