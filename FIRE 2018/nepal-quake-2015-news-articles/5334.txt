Emirati Surgeon Dr. Adel Al Shamri, Executive Director of the Zayed Giving Initiative, Chairman of the UAE voluntary medical team, said the quick response to the emergency medical mission reflects preparedness to provide the medical and humanitarian aid to alleviate the repercussions of the disaster that befell tens of thousands of Nepalese who had their homes destroyed and displaced by the earthquake.
