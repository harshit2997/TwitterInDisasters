VIRGINIA BEACH -- A Virginia Beach man is one of thousands of Americans stuck in Nepal, unable to make it back home.

The death toll from the 7.8 magnitude earthquake rose above 4,000 today. Many are in a frenzy to leave the country, fearing the effects of more aftershocks.

Eddie Holcombe and his wife were lying in bed Saturday morning when they learned their youngest son Adam had been involved in the massive quake.

"We got a call from the HR person at his company, checking on his condition. We woke up and found out about the earthquake at that time," he said.

In shock, Holcombe immediately turned on the television and checked his email.

"Luckily he had sent an email that was received about 3 a.m. on my phone, that there was an earthquake and he was safe," Holcombe said.

The 27-year-old left Virginia Beach for Nepal April 16. He was there alone on a hiking trip. On Friday, April 24, he sent his parents a picture of himself at the peak of Annapurna - the 10th highest mountain in the world.

"To go from that picture where he's standing on top of the mountain one day, and obviously very excited about his accomplishment, to what could have been a very bad reality, it's been an emotional roller coaster," Holcombe said.

Since then, Adam and his father have been exchanging a series of emails - some of them describing the terror of aftershocks and tremors.

"It was the scariest thing I have felt in my life. Very surreal. Everything shaking violently and roads like little ocean waves. Have felt multiple aftershocks. You just run outside and pray," one of Adam's emails read.

"He said they run outside when they feel the tremors because you don't want to be inside the building in case it comes down. He said a lot of people in the country are sleeping outside in a field, some in a car so they won't be in buildings," Holcombe said.

A Virginia Tech graduate and now a CPA, Adam has a big thirst for adventure and life - a young excursionist who wants to see the world. As his family anxiously awaits his return, his father has a bit of advice. "I'm gonna suggest he go to a beach and lay in a warm environment instead of some of the places he's traveled around the world for his next vacation," Holcombe said.

Holcombe says he put in a call to the state department for some guidance. He was told that right now, there is no plan to evacuate Americans, as search and rescue efforts are the main focus.

"As unsettling as this has been, we do know that he's alive and he's safe. If we had not been able to have that kind of communication, then that would have of course elevated it to a whole other situation that probably some people in the United States are having to deal with. It's really unthinkable," he said.
