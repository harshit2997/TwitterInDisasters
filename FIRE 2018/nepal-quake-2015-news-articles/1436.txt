Quick aid for Nepalese
</headline>

<text>
Nepal is struggling in the aftermath of its worst earthquake in 81 years. The 7.8-magnitude quake has claimed more than 3,000 lives so far, and left about 6.6 million ― nearly a fifth of Nepal's population ― homeless.



Panic still grips the Himalayan country as aftershocks hit Katmandu and cut-off rural areas. The death toll could surge as many survivors are still waiting to be rescued under the rubble of collapsed buildings.



Fortunately, there were no Korean deaths, but the Foreign Ministry said three Koreans were hurt. Among them was a couple in their 50s who were travelling in Nepal. The husband was seriously injured. The ministry should be on alert, given that some 650 Koreans reside in Nepal and many Korean tourists visit there.



Rescuers are reportedly having difficulties reaching the more remote areas near the epicenter of the quake because communications are down and roads are blocked in many areas. The earthquake triggered avalanches near a Mount Everest base camp, killing more than 10 climbers and marooning hundreds of others in the highland regions.



Nepal mobilized its military to rescue survivors after declaring a state of emergency, but its search and rescue efforts seem limited, given the extent of the damage that the deadly quake brought to the impoverished state.



Offers of humanitarian assistance are pouring in from around the world to help Nepalese people suffering from one of the worst natural disasters. What's crucial at this juncture is for governments and aid agencies to rush doctors, volunteers and equipment to Nepal because there is still time to save lives.



Dozens of U.S. aid workers and rescue dogs headed to Nepal aboard a military transport plane, and the European Union released 3 million euros in emergency aid for Nepal. A 62-member Chinese rescue team with sniffer dogs arrived in Katmandu.



The Seoul government on Sunday pledged $1 million in initial humanitarian aid to Nepal and decided to send a search and rescue team as soon as possible. Our officials need to be more attentive in sending rescuers, keeping in mind that our improvised teams contributed little to rescue operations and made much ado about nothing when a devastating earthquake struck Haiti in 2010.



The Nepali quake should be a wake-up call to Korea. Of course, Korea has remained unscathed from earthquakes so far, but it's true the frequency of quakes has increased since the 1980s. More recently, Korea also experienced strong quakes measuring more than 5.0 on the Richter scale, raising the possibility that Korea is no longer safe from the threat of earthquakes.



All this explains why Korea should do its utmost to hammer out viable anti-quake measures, including making it obligatory for builders to adopt earthquake-resistant designs.
