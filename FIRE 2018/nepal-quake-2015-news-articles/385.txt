LUCKNOW: Following the powerful 7.9 magnitude earthquake which struck Nepal on Saturday, flight services to Kathmandu were cancelled or put on hold because of closure of airport. "Since Kathmandu airport was closed following the earthquake this morning, the Kathmandu flight was diverted to Lucknow and would return to Mumbai. Consequently, return flight from Kathmandu stands cancelled," Jet Airways said in a statement.Confirming the development, district magistrate of Lucknow Raj Shekhar said, "Jet Airways 266, which operates from Mumbai to Kathmandu was diverted to Lucknow at 1.23pm. There were as many as 177 passengers on board. The flight finally departed for Mumbai at 2.41 pm." The DM added that only one flight has been diverted. Officials of the police and district administration are at the airport and are in constant touch with airport and airline authorities concerned, ensuring safety of passengers.Jet Airways also said it cancelled services on the New Delhi-Kathamndu-New Delhi sector, adding that it is monitoring closely the situation and updating its passenger on regular basis. "We operate three flights to Kathmandu. While the morning flight from Delhi operated as per the schedule, the two other services, one from Delhi and another from Kolkata are on hold as of now. We will operate them as soon as we get a nod from the aviation authorities in Kathmandu," an Air India spokesperson said.Budget carrier SpiceJet and IndiGo have also decided not to operate till they get clearance from the Nepalese government.
