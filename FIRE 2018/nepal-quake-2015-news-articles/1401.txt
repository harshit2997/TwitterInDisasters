Soon after arriving, the team of 62 specialists began searching for survivors in devastated areas. They quickly located one man and managed to pull him to safety after three hours of work and amid two powerful aftershocks. Team members are also sharing information with the Chinese consulate and local authorities on conditions in the quake zone.



They have begun setting up a command center in the city for the deployment of equipment and personnel in the coming days. The equipment they brought with them is expected to meet relief demands for around 3,000 people.
