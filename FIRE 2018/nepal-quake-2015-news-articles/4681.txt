Sri Lankan Contingent Busy Clearing Blocked Roads & Treating More & More Patients The relief and rescue contingent, comprised of Sri Lanka's Army, Navy, Air Force and Civil sector consultants, now engaged in post-earthquake humanitarian services in Nepal has treated 81 injured earthquake victims, cleared debris and rubble and succeeded in re-opening three major roads, remained not movable in Dolalghart and Bodgam areas during the past two days (May 3 - 4) after the tragedy struck in Nepal. Using excavators, motor graders, backhoes and other equipment, a group of 23 contingent members of the Sri Lanka Engineers cleared the blocked road patch from Sipaghat to Phimpar area during Sunday (3) and Monday (4), despite poor weather and visibility. The clearance of the road patch enabled passage of traffic between major cities for most essential supplies. Another road patch of 3 km in Dolalghart was cleared by the Engineers in the contingent, thereby connecting the road to other roads in the suburbs with the participation of more than 12 contingent members of the Sri Lanka Engineers and others. 10 more contingent members of the Sri Lanka Engineers meanwhile effectively cleared the Arniko Highway which remained impassable after the earthquake hit the area. The same road has now enabled the passage of speedy supplies to affected areas. Similarly, civil medical consultants and nursing staff of the Sri Lanka Army Medical Corps (SLAMC) on Sunday (3), treated 51 victims, including children in Dolalghart area and another group of 30 victims in Bodgam area in Nepal on Monday (4). The Sri Lankan contingent, commanded by Major General Maithri Dias since its arrival in Nepal, has treated more than 2000 victims, either giving them first-aid and medical assistance or referring them to the contingent-managed Dressing Rooms where mini surgeries were also carried out on the victims, considering the gravity of the wounds sustained. Following initiatives of HE the President Maithripala Sirisena, Commander-in-Chief and Hon. Prime Minister under the close supervision of the Commander of the Army, Lieutenant General Crishanthe De Silva, dispatch of tri-service relief contingents, was organized in close coordination with the Disaster Management Centre, Ministry of Health and Ministry of Foreign Affairs. The first contingent left Sri Lanka in less than a day after the tragedy struck, to be among the first three foreign relief teams to arrive in Nepal. Courtesy : Army Media
