The first batch of South Korean emergency workers to quake-devastated Nepal launched rescue efforts.



Seoul's Foreign Ministry said that the ten-member Korea Disaster Response Team (KDRT) and a five-member advance team arrived in Kathmandu Tuesday afternoon.



After consulting with local disaster management authorities, the Korean disaster response unit launched rescue activities in Bhaktapur, located some 15 kilometers east of the Nepalese capital.



South Korea will send a total of 40 emergency personnel to the quake-devastated nation. The remaining 30 rescue workers will head for Nepal around Friday.
