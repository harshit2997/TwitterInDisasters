WASHINGTON (CNN) – – A U.S. military helicopter with as many as eight people on board has gone missing in Nepal as Marine personnel worked to help the people recovering from the recent earthquake.

Military officials are searching for a Marine helicopter that went missing Tuesday evening near Charikot, Nepal, Pentagon officials said. The aircraft was assisting with disaster relief after an earthquake struck the south Asian nation, killing thousands, late last month. Another earthquake struck the area on Tuesday.

“A UH-1Y Huey with, Marine Light Attack Helicopter Squadron 469 in support of Joint Task Force 505 was declared missing while supporting Operation Sahayogi Haat,” U.S. Navy Capt. Chris Sims told CNN in a statement Tuesday.

About 300 American personnel are on the ground in Nepal.

The cause of the disappearance was not immediately clear and the incident is under investigation.
