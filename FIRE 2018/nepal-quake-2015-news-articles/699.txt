Foreign Ministry to meet on help for Nepal
</headline>

<text>
Spokesman Sek Wannamethee said that more officers from the ministry will be dispatched to Nepal, to help the Thai embassy assist Thais working and travelling in the country.

The Public Health Ministry's 30-men medical team and medical supplies are reportedly leaving Thailand tomorrow, as the first batch of help. The National Reform Council plans to convene on Tuesday to raise funds for quake victims. The Defence Ministry has reportedly mobilised a rescue team, a mobile medical unit and medical supplies. Prime Minister Prayut Chan-o-cha said earlier today that the Thai government would ship some 300-500 tonnes of rice to Nepal. Sek asserted that it cannot be confirmed yet if among the casualties on Mt Everest was a Thai woman. This remains under an investigation, he added.

He added that the Thai embassy has also contacted the local authorities in Pokhara to help locate six Thai students, reportedly staying in the city while the quake hit many parts of the country.

He added that all 34 Thais attending a meeting in the city of Nagarkot are safe. All are prepared to return to Thailand on April 27.

To assist Thais in the country, a Hotline Centre is in place at the Thai Embassy in Kathmandu (+977 980 106 9233 and +977 984 124 2094).
