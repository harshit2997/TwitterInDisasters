Situation Overview

Six days into the response, the ongoing relief efforts continue to focus on reaching a greater number of areas, in particular the remote and hard-to-reach areas where many of the poorest and most affected remain.

It is becoming evident that a scale-up of operations is required to ensure immediate and principled assistance reaches people in desperate need within the next six weeks, in advance of the monsoon season. After the field visits and meetings with Government authorities and partners, the Emergency Relief Coordinator Valerie Amos emphasized the urgent need to provide emergency shelter and basic goods and services to people affected, as the weather conditions continue to deteriorate.

Following initial assessments, the Government has extended the most affected area to include Makawanpur and Sindhuli districts, in addition to Bhaktapur, Dhading, Dolakha, Gorkha, Kathmandu, Lalitpur, Lamjung, Rasuwa, Ramechhap, Nuwakot, and Sindulpalchowk.

The United Nations Disaster Assessment and Coordination (UNDAC) teams have traveled to Dhading and Gorkha, where the team has set-up a humanitarian hub for the area. On 2 May, another team is scheduled to arrive in Sindulpachowk District.

In Gorkha, the UNDAC team has found that there is a dire need for shelter, particularly tents and blankets. Access to some remote villages remains a key challenge as many landing zones are unsafe due to debris, altitude and current weather conditions. Road access is limited. Some remote villages can only be accessed by helicopters.
