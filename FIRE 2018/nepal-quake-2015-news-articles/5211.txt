ARMED with money for supplies and more than 150 toys, Lew Tuck will begin his journey to Nepal to help in the wake of the country's devastating earthquakes.

Mr Tuck will leave next week and said he planned to spend three weeks in Nepal with his international team, assisting where he could.

However, Mr Tuck said he only considered himself a "postman" who delivered the kindness and donations given by others.

Mr Tuck and his wife Sue Tuck, from Whitsunday Hearing, regularly visit the Himalayas and work as part of the Himalayan Health and Hearing program, but his wife will not be joining him this time.

Mr Tuck said he would also work to put women with health issues in contact with trained professionals who could help and also hand out much-needed sanitary supplies.
