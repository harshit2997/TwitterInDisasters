The Foreign Ministry has clarified that Nepalis and foreigners living abroad can bring relief packages for distribution in the country. Such packages should not exceed 96 tonnes at a time, the ministry said.

The ministry officials, however, said the relief packages exceeding the airport’s load capacity will be refused. “The situation where the relief packages could exceed the load capacity should be brought in two shifts,” said Foreign Ministry Spokesperson Tara Prasad Pokhrel.

Meanwhile, refuting claims that the ministry had obstructed any foreign donors from contributing to Nepal, Pokharel said: “If anyone brings relief from abroad by considering the load limit, we have no intention to stop them.”

Pokhrel also made it clear that relief packages must be sent to Nepal only after ensuring the place of distribution and person or organisation responsible for the distribution.

While reiterating that the relief packages are waived of customes duty, he said the ministry had been keeping a close watch to prevent any irregularities in the guise of relief packages.
