Two of Arizona's own American Red Cross volunteers have been asked to lend their expertise to the disaster response happening in Nepal.

The Bradleys are a retired couple who live in Pinetop, AZ. There are, certainly, other ways they could be spending their golden years. However, they are two of only six Red Cross volunteers who deploy around the world to handle communications anytime there's a major disaster.

As the saying goes, when you find something you love, stick with it.

"We were basically fed by the American Red Cross every day while we were digging their house out," Julie Bradley explained.

Glen and Julie Bradley's love of volunteering developed out of Hurricane Katrina.

"My parents had 21 feet of water in their house," she added.

In the 10 years since, they've added house fires and more destructive events to their disaster response resume.

"In the case of Haiti, it was one large city that was devastated," Glen Bradley said.

But the quake that hit Nepal's vast Kathmandu valley sent shockwaves for 60 square miles, all but wiping out communications.

"Our role is to go in and support the Nepal Red Cross with whatever communications they're going to need to operate," he said.

The husband and wife IT and telecommunications team was just in Nepal 16 months ago.

"We put up repeater stations in the mountains there so that small radios could be used," Glen said.

They were expecting Nepal might be struck at any moment. Severe, widespread damage would be a sure thing.

"They would build multi-story buildings without rebar but with concrete blocks," Julie Bradley said.

They'll be gone for at least a month and sleep in a tent every night. They say they wouldn't have it any other way.

"We've had a really, really good life, a very fortunate life, and it's just our mechanism of doing a payback," Glen added.

Glen and Julie will stop in Washington, D.C., Monday before heading to Nepal. They'll be picking up networking gear so that they can set up Internet services for the Red Cross' own relief operation there in Nepal.
