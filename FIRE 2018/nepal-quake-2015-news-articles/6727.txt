A SURVIVOR of the Nepal earthquake is working hard to help those affected by the disaster.

Ian Wainman, 42, from Rainhill, was initially feared missing in the aftermath of the 7.8-magnitude earthquake, but declared himself alive and well via Facebook last week.

Since then, the Manchester United supporter has helped raise money to fill trucks with supplies to deliver to remote areas of Nepal's Gurkha region.

Over recent days, he has been handing out medical supplies, blankets, food buckets and shoes, as well as helping build or rebuild homes and shelter.

Ian, who was born in Whiston, said the mountains "wobbled" when the earthquake struck.

He was trekking on the Annapurna Circuit and said he could hear the sound of rocks cracking around them.

He said: "My thoughts and prayers go to all my Nepalese friends and the fantastic people I have met over the 18 years since I first experienced this beautiful country. We're just taking each day as it comes."

A Facebook post from Ian, who is travelling in Nepal for the third time, read: â€œThere's lots of people motivated here. Groups from every nation are doing their bit.

"Food is not so much the issue in the more remote areas as most of these are villages are rural farming communities, self sufficient in most aspects. Their immediate danger is cold weather and rain due to it being on high ground.

"Better than just getting tarpaulin, it seems much more logical to get sheets of corrugated roofing panels to these villages so they have a more permanent shelter to get them through the oncoming monsoon."

Ian and friend Mark were heading to the village of Tantlind to assist with relief efforts and assess what further supplies would be needed.

He said: "Money is still coming in and every penny helps towards materials which will make the monsoon that bit more bearable over the next months.

"Message myself or Mark Marcus Boog if you wish to donate."

To donate via Paypal, go to paypal.com, follow instructions, enter the email address markchambers@hotmail.co.uk and amount.

The earthquake is known to have killed more than 7,000 people and injured at least10,000.
