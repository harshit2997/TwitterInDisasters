CORVALLIS, Ore. - Oregon State students from Nepal and other members of the Nepalese community in Corvallis set up a table outside the OSU Memorial Union building Thursday taking contributions for earthquake relief.



The jar filled with cash while they were out there from 10 a.m. to 5 p.m. Thursday.



S spokesman and OSU civil engineering student Deepak Rayamajhi said his family and wife's family are OK, but they had people in the group who have had family members injured.



They are sending all contributions to Oregon-based group Global Nutrition Rmpowerment, which is sending 100 percent of all the funds to Nepal. An anonymous donor is covering all the administrative costs.



You can learn more at globalnutritionempowerment.org and nepaloregon.org.
