killer quake

Two groups – one each from Hyderabad and Guntur – were holidaying in the valley when massive tremors hit the region

New Delhi: The massive earthquake that shook Nepal this morning left its share of concern in the Telugu speaking States too with dozens of tourists from both Andhra Pradesh and Telangana getting stuck in various places in Nepal. While officially so far at least two groups of tourists contacted their sources back home (one left for Nepal from Malkajgiri in Hyderabad and the other from Undavalli in Guntur district in Andhra Pradesh), the situation of others is not known.

According travel operators here, the number of South Indian pilgrims to Nepal would be around 2,000 from the South – at least half of them would be from AP and Telangana – during this season. Going by the messages sent and telephonic talks with some of them, it could be averred that everything is fine with them except that they are now stranded. It is not yet known whether the road route through the treacherous Himalayan region connecting India is intact.

This factor could be vital in their safe return as it is also not known when the Tribhuvan International Airport of Kathmandu opens for air traffic having suffered extensive damage in the quake. Meanwhile, following instructions of Andhra Pradesh Chief Minister N Chandrababu Naidu, the Special Representative of the AP government, K Rammohan Rao, contacted the Ministry of External Affairs at once and sought its cooperation in securing a ground report.

He also directed the Resident Commissioner and the Special Commissioner (of External Engagement) of the AP government to do the needful in rescuing the pilgrims and tourists stranded. They have also been instructed to arrange for transportation. The AP government has also installed a help line with a number (011- 23384016).

At the same time, the National Disaster Response Force (NDRF) organised 10 relief and rescue teams to be sent to Nepal immediately with the latest disaster management gadgets, medical component along with a trained dog squad. An Air India flight is landing this night in Kathmandu to ferry back some of the stranded pilgrims to New Delhi.
