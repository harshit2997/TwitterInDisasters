First Canadians taken out of Nepal
</headline>

A military plane has taken its first group of stranded Canadians out of Nepal, with another flight scheduled for Thursday.

The first C-17 arrived in Kathmandu on Wednesday along with 31 Canadian Forces members and supplies then took the first group of Canadians to New Delhi, India, the government confirmed.

Several media reports state there were 96 people on the first flight.

In a statement issued late Wednesday afternoon, Foreign Affairs Minister Rob Nicholson said the passengers were Canadians and foreign nationals, adding that about 70 people were able to leave Nepal on commercial flights.

A second C-17 is on its way to Kathmandu, Nicholson stated, and is carrying 51 military personnel including medical staff and other specialists. The plane is also carrying a cargo vehicle, military ambulance and other supplies so the military isn't taxing local resources.

The second C-17 will also help Canadians leave the country if needed.

Although there is no Canadian embassy in Nepal, the government has set up a consular service point in central Kathmandu to help Canadians.

The government has not said how many Canadians were known to be in Nepal when the deadly 7.8 magnitude earthquake struck on Saturday.

"The Emergency Watch and Response Centre continues to work around the clock to locate all Canadians believed to have been in the affected area at the time the earthquake hit and reach out to all Canadians affected... Our consular officials are providing the last known co-ordinates of Canadians in remote areas to our allies, and, despite the challenges, we will continue to provide assistance to those who may be stranded."
