HK resident among dead in Nepal quake

A Hong Kong resident is among those killed in the Nepal earthquake disaster, which has wrought death and destruction to the poor Himalayan country.

Authorities on Tuesday confirmed that a 42-year-old male from Hong Kong has died in Nepal’s worst natural disaster in 80 years, according to Apple Daily.

The victim is said to be a person of Nepali origin who has been living in Hong Kong.

Meanwhile, three days after the disaster, the Kathmandu international airport was said to be in a complete mess, swamped with passengers in their tens of thousands trying to leave the country.

A group of Chinese University of Hong Kong medical school students was in Nepal when the disaster took place. Five of the 12 students returned to Hong Kong Tuesday morning.

One of students was a person surnamed Lau, whose mother was seen shedding tears of joy when she saw her son make it back safe and sound, the report said.

Another student, who bears the surname Wong, said basic commodities such as water were in short supply in the disaster areas and that internet connectivity was hard to get.

He said he was relieved to be back in Hong Kong as there were fears of more aftershocks after the deadly weekend quake.

The medical school students were in Nepal on a month-long exchange program that began on April 4. When the quake struck, they were put up in a local doctor’s home.

Later, they went to a local hospital to see if they could be of any assistance, but found that there was little that they could do.

According to the Immigration Department, a total of 42 Hong Kong people had requested help from the department as of 7 pm Tuesday. But it is yet to establish contact with eight of them.

The department has dispatched three officers to Nepal and also set up a special counter at the airport to offer assistance to Hong Kong people.

Meanwhile, there have been reports that authorities have urged a group of 20 tourists traveling in Nepal to end their trip immediately and return home.

In other related news, a Hong Kong woman said there was power outage in Kathmandu Tuesday night and that the atmosphere in the city was very tense, with thunderstorm weather making things worse.

The woman, who gave her name as Debbie, said she managed to secure air tickets with the help of the Chinese embassy, enabling her to return to Hong Kong Wednesday along with several of her friends.
