Nepal Earthquake Death Toll Reaches 16, Injured Exceed 300



KATHMANDU  The death toll in the latest 7.3 magnitude earthquake that rocked Nepal on Tuesday has risen to at least 16, while the number of injured stands at 335, according to Nepals National Emergency Operation Center.



Most of the casualties occurred in the Dolakha, a district northwest of Kathmandu, where at least 8 people died, while the agency tweeted that the remaining victims were in other central districts, and that infrastructure facilities in several districts of the country were damaged by the earthquake.



Home Ministry spokesperson Laxmi Prasad Dhakal told Efe that more than 50 of the wounded were from Sindhupalchok district and another 14 had been admitted to a hospital in Kathmandu.



Sindhupalchok, located to the northwest of the Nepalese capital, was the area worst-affected by the major quake that struck the mountainous country on April 25, as more than one-third of the 8,000 deaths caused by that quake occurred there.



According to different sources, a five-story building in the historic city of Bhaktapur in Kathmandu Valley that had been damaged in the previous earthquake completely collapsed after Tuesdays quake, as did another building in the capital.



Nepal is still recovering from the April 25 earthquake that left more than 8,000 dead and 15,000 injured, and tens of thousands of houses damaged.



Authorities are working together with international organizations to provide aid to victims concentrated in the Kathmandu Valley, and to deliver food and medical help to more remote regions.



The April 25 earthquake was already being called the worst in Nepals recent history and one of the most powerful in the region, while fears loom that Tuesdays will match its devastation as the damage is assessed.
