Nepal earthquake: Hobart woman Amanda-Sue Markham anxious for news of sister Ballantyne Forder
</headline>

<text>
THE family of a young Perth woman who had been unaccounted for in Nepal have received the best news possible – she is safe.

After an anxious wait for information Hobart’s Amanda Sue-Markham, the older sister of Ballantyne Forder, has received confirmation that Ms Forder is alive.

“SHE’S SAFE!!! Moved the entire orphanage to a field where they’ve been camping since yesterday! So proud of my little sister!” Ms Markham tweeted a short time ago.

Ms Markham had been desperately seeking information about her younger sister following the earthquake in Nepal.

Ms Forder, 20, of Perth, Western Australia, travelled solo to Nepal around two months ago to work as a volunteer at an orphanage.

Ms Markham, of West Hobart, had taken to Twitter, posting pictures of Ms Forder, affectionately known as Billie, in the hope it would lead to information from those on the ground in Nepal.

On Wednesday, Ms Forder left the city of Pokhara where she had been working at an orphanage to make her way east to the capital Kathmandu to work at an orphanage for babies.

Ms Markham said communication with her sister was normally difficult due to the lack of phone reception and electricity in many parts of Nepal.

Speaking with the Mercury earlier today Ms Markham said her sister was adventurous and independent, and was looking forward to spending her 21st birthday volunteering in Nepal.

“Her first priorities would be to survive and protect the children. I’m trying to be really positive, she’s a very resourceful young woman ... she’s not the sort of girl who will fall in a heap, she will keep it together and do what’s necessary,” she said.

Ms Markham said while the whole family had been anxious for news about Ms Forder, messages of support via social media had provided comfort.

“It’s peace of mind to know there are people out there looking for my sister,” she said earlier today.
