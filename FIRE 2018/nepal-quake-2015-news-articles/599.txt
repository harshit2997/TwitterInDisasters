Chief minister Manohar Lal Khattar on Sunday said that the state government had dispatched nearly 30,000 food packets to the earthquake-hit Nepal.

In Karnal to attend a religious function, Khattar said that the state government was in constant touch with the Centre for rescue and relief programmes for Nepal and Uttar Pradesh and other Indian states.

"We have asked details of required blankets and clothing and soon more dispatches would be sent to specified spots. I appeal people to unite in this time of crisis for the help of the sufferers," he said.
