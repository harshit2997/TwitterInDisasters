How avalanche covers Everest camp. Video

The avalanche that killed dozens of people in Mount Everest base camp was shot by one of the victims.

German adventurer Jost Kobusch had a narrow escape. He had recorded the video just before he managed to dive into his tent.

The deadly avalanche killed 17 people and injured nearly 61 on Saturday, 25.

"The ground is shaking," one of the witnesses said, as the avalanche approached.

On of the largest earthquakes over the last 81 year that took place in Nepal triggered the avalanche in the mountains.

More than 2,200 people were killed under the catastrophe.
