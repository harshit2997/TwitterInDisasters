The RBAF personnel will work alongside the SAF team to provide medical assistance to the earthquake victims in Gokarna town.

SINGAPORE: Two Republic of Singapore Air Force (RSAF) C-130 aircraft departed for Kathmandu on Thursday morning (Apr 30) at about 5am and 11am, respectively, the Ministry of Defence (MINDEF) said.

The two aircraft ferried sustenance and medical supplies, six additional SAF personnel from the Changi Regional Humanitarian Assistance and Disaster Relief Coordination Centre (RHCC) and eight personnel from the Royal Brunei Armed Forces (RBAF), it said in a press release.

The additional RHCC personnel will augment the existing team already on the ground assisting the Nepalese disaster management authorities and military in coordinating the relief effort, said MINDEF.

The RBAF personnel will join the Singapore Armed Forces (SAF) medical team deployed to Gokarna town, where both armed forces will work together to provide medical assistance to the earthquake victims.

The deployment of RBAF personnel was coordinated through the Brunei international liaison officer to the RHCC, and demonstrates the defence ties between the SAF and RBAF, MINDEF added.
