Emotional scenes were witnessed at the city railway station on Tuesday evening as four pilgrims, who were stranded in Kathmandu, arrived here by Golconda Express. A batch of 26 pilgrims from Palacol and 20 others from Narsapur too reached the city.

Family members of the pilgrims garlanded and hugged them. The joy on seeing their near and dear returning from the quake-hit Nepal was evident. “We were worshipping at Pasupatinath temple on the day when the quake struck. Since then, things were tough but we are thankful to the officials as they supported us and arranged for our food and accommodation,” said 56-year-old B. Durgamba, a resident of Sitammapeta.

On Sunday, Ms. Durgamba had spoken to her son Chandrasekhar and daughter-in-law Nagamani assuring them that she was safe and would be going to Janakapuri along with other group members. “Thank God, my mother returned safe,” said an excited Mr. Chandrasekhar.

Three others from the city who arrived here are J. Ramakrishna, Nagalaxmi and J. Jagadish, all from Sitammapeta. The entire team of 50 members, including those from Palacol and Narsapur left New Delhi on Monday and reached Vijayawada on Tuesday evening , said Urban Tehsildar R. Siva Rao.

Meanwhile, family members of four other pilgrims from Satyanarayanapuram from city are a worried lot. “My parents called from Jamsam and said that they were safe. Hopefully they will start to Pokra tomorrow and reach New Delhi a day after,” said Ranganath, son of a pilgrim said.
