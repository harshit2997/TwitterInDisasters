Every time Ashwin Popat would try to climb to Langtang Gosaikunda - the trek that ends at the high mountain lakes -- bad weather would stop him short of attempting the climb. But the persistent Mulund trekker, 72, on April 21 set off for Nepal hoping to be third-time lucky. Only, he did not apprehend that the nature could unleash its wrath. Leaving all family members worried, the man along with his two nephews - Naman Sethia, 21, and Ravi Popat, 28 -- are now stranded in the earthquake-prone zone, waiting to be airlifted.The Popats are known for their daughter Urmi's book Arctic and Antarctic - Journeys To The Extremeties of the Earth -- penned after the family visited Antarctica. They also hold the distinction of being the first Indian family to unfurl the tricolour there.Ashwin Popat had taken the two youngsters promising them the journey of a lifetime. And it was, but not the kind they were hoping for. This has left his wife Shakuntala, 68, and daughters Jasmine and Urmi worried. Speaking to Mumbai Mirror, Urmi said, "They had finished almost 80 per cent of the trek, but as they were passing Lauri Binayak pass they felt the earth shake. They found the tremors to be mild, not as violent as the destruction it has caused." Popat has contacted the family twice due to poor mobile connectivity since the deadly quake struck Nepal on Saturday.The trio had reached Dhunche's Braba Army camp on Sunday afternoon, the last time they contacted the family. "At Dhunche, the network was better but no power to charge the handsets," Urmi said. "He told me that 500 people - a mix of trekkers, foreign tourists and locals -- have assembled at the camp. They are fast running out of essentials and are praying for an early evacuation. However, they are yet to receive any help from the rescue teams."Dhunche is a seven-hour ride from Kathmandu and since all roads have become almost non-existent, they cannot move out. Reading out from a text she received from her father, Urmi said, "They only want the authorities to know that they are at Dhunche and need to be helped." An architect by profession, Ashwin Popat is an ardent trekker who has made it to Nepal six times before. "He is a regular at the Everest base camp. But he still does not know of what has befallen there," Urmi said.
