Tourists Feared Dead In Nepal Trekking Valley (buried under six meters of ice, snow and rock)

Posted on by Red in Blue PA

Up to 300 people may have been buried in Nepal's popular trekking area of Langtang during last month's devastating earthquake, a local official said.

That figure could include up to 110 tourists, assistant district administrator Gautam Rimal told Reuters.

"There are body parts, broken limbs and pieces of flesh scattered in the area," he said.

Langtang Village, which lies around 40 miles (60km) north of the capital Kathmandu, was almost completely wiped out when an avalanche and landslide struck the area during the 7.8-magnitude quake almost two weeks ago.

The bodies of the victims are believed to be buried under up to six metres of ice, snow and rock.
