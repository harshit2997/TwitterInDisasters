Kiwis caught in Nepal quake plead for aid amidst 'chaos'

Kiwis caught up in the devastating Nepal earthquake say help is still desperately needed, despite a New Zealand search and rescue team being told not to head to the disaster zone.

More than 4000 people have died following the weekend's 7.8 magnitude earthquake, with the death toll expected to rise further.

New Zealand has made an initial contribution of $1 million to the relief effort, and had offered to send a 37-strong search team - but that team has now been told to stay home.

Despite that, every bit of help is now vital, according to Kiwis who experienced the massive quake.

Tourist Judy Darragh was at an airport when the quake struck - and describes the scenes afterward as "chaos".

She's encouraging New Zealanders to support Nepal.

"Give money to the Himalyan Trust. That's a sure way for money to get through. Go online and google any support system."

Prajjwal Rana is rushing back to Nepal from New Zealand to be with his struggling family.

The 25-year-old's only spoken to his injured mother once since the quake and is also worried about his sister - a young nurse who's struggling to cope.

"Being the Motherland, I have to go there and help them as much as I can. That's what I want and I can save some people's life," he says.
