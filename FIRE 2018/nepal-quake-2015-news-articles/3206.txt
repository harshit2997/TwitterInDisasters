A Calgary woman who was caught in an earthquake and subsequent avalanche while hiking in Nepal has finally made contact with loved ones back home.

Tamara McLeod, 24, was hiking in the Langtang region of Nepal when the earthquake struck on Saturday.

Her family managed to connect a call to her cellphone following the initial quake, but they had lost contact with her shortly afterwards.

That’s when they heard reports of an avalanche hitting the area, raising concern for her safety.

However, those prayers were answered on Monday night when Tamara finally made contact with her family.

Her family tells CTV that Tamara told them she is safe with four other people who’ve been trapped as a result of the avalanche in the Langtang Region.

McLeod is currently in the village of Briddhim, near the area where she was hiking.

Her family is now putting pressure on the Nepalese government to send a rescue team into the northern regions to rescue the stranded hikers.

The McLeod’s aren’t the only Canadian family concerned about loved ones in the region, and Canada’s Disaster Assistance Response Team (DART) is en route to the area, where they will be in place once the Nepalese government officially requests their help.

30 members will be landing in Kuwait, trained in water purification techniques, logistics, and how to administer aid to survivors.

Officials say they learned a lot since their mission helping survivors of the earthquake in Haiti in 2010.

“We’ve done a lot of training and stuff to go towards an earthquake environment, so the guys are really excited,” says Sergeant David Hilliar with CFB Comox. “We put a lot of time into training, travelling all over the country, doing different courses, so we’re definitely looking forward to getting over there and doing some good.”

Once the team is landed in Kuwait, and advance team of four members will continue on the Nepal where they’ll figure out the best location to deploy.

Ottawa has already pledged $5M in aid for Nepal and will match every dollar donated to the ‘Nepal Earthquake Relief Fund’ until May 25.
