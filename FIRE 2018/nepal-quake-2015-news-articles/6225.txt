A U.S. Marine Corps UH-1Y Huey helicopter with six Marines and two Nepalese service members aboard was declared missing Tuesday near Charikot, Nepal, Joint Task Force 505 officials reported.

Officials said the status of those aboard is unknown.

The Marine Light Attack Helicopter Squadron 469 helicopter was flying in support of Joint Task Force 505, delivering humanitarian aid to people affected by a recent earthquake and was evacuating casualties back to Kathmandu.

Joint Task Force 505 personnel are responding to the emergency, officials said, and Nepalese military forces near the helicopter's last known location are searching for the missing aircraft.

U.S. and Nepalese aircraft will resume aerial search procedures at daybreak, officials said.

Meanwhile, the us Defense Department said it continues to provide humanitarian assistance and disaster response to the people of Nepal.

Pentagon spokesman Army Col. Steve Warren told reporters that members of the U.S. Agency for International Development's disaster assistance response team, including urban search and rescue personnel, in coordination with the U.S. military's Joint Task Force 505, are conducting aerial assessments of Dolahka and the surrounding areas to view the extent of recent damage.

The department has committed approximately $7.5 million to this effort of the $10 million Defense Secretary Ash Carter approved in Overseas Humanitarian Disaster and Civic Aid funds, Warren said.

He also confirmed the international airport in Nepal's capital of Kathmandu remains open and that all DoD personnel who are present in the region "have been accounted for and are safe."

Tuesday, a magnitude-7.3 earthquake struck the Dolahka district in the central region of Nepal, killing 65 people in Nepal and at least 17 in neighboring India.

The U.S. Geological Survey considers this to be the largest of more than 100 aftershocks that followed the magnitude-7.8 earthquake on April 25, Warren said.
