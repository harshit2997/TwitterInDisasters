Christchurch City Council is supporting the Red Cross Nepal earthquake appeal with collection boxes at libraries and service centres.

From tomorrow, members of the public who wish to make a financial donation can drop it into the donation boxes at the Civic Offices (53 Hereford Street), libraries and service centres. There will also be condolence pages available to sign, which will later be bound into a book and sent to the Nepalese government.

Mayor Lianne Dalziel is encouraging Christchurch residents to dig deep to support the Nepalese community.

"Our thoughts are with the people of Nepal and the various aid and rescue agencies who are working tirelessly at this difficult time. Christchurch people in particular know firsthand the devastation an earthquake can bring and I know they will want to do everything possible to help.

"We also know how much financial support means at this time. The extent of the damage is overwhelming and providing funding will actually enable the agencies on the ground already to deliver much more.

"I encourage everyone to reach into their pockets and contribute to this appeal as every dollar will help those affected. It is now our time to return the generosity and outpouring of help and support that we received as a city during the February 2011 earthquake.

"There will also be an opportunity for Christchurch residents to stand side-by-side in solidarity with our local Nepalese community who are holding a candlelight vigil on Friday 1 May at 6.30pm in Victoria Square."

A devastating 7.8 magnitude earthquake struck Nepal on Saturday 25 April with the epicentre 80kms west of Kathmandu. The death toll is reported to have reached more than 4000 with another 6500 injured.
