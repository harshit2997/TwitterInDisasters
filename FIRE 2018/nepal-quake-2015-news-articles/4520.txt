With the death toll in Nepal’s devastating earthquake crossing over 6,000 lives, the Chhattisgarh government was on Wednesday mulling sending a team of doctors to the calamity-hit neighbor.

The principal opposition party – Congress mocked chief minister Raman Singh and his cabinet; Congress spokesperson R P Singh said that it is indeed a generous move, but CM should focus more on the deteriorating health facilities in the state.

Taking a dig at the ruling government, Singh said that the government hospitals are facing an acute crunch of doctors.

Meanwhile, over 6,000 bodies have been pulled from beneath the debris left by razed structures after Saturday’s 7.9-magnitude temblor.
