#NepalEarthquake: How can you help? : News
</headline>

<text>
With over 4,000 lives in the #NepalEarthquake resting and constant news about deaths and continuing casualties have been responsible for skipping our heartbeats. And this way, our mother nature tells us that we cannot have any control over some things, quite definitely yes.

As the whole world has come together to support the crisis, right now all we can do, is stretch a helping hand and we should help to, our fellow brothers and sisters.



What can you do?/ How can you help?



Donate: The best and the direct way to help, is to help the needy by donating money, clothes, or any and every possible thing.

Where and how?



1. UNICEF: To ensure every child's safety, simply donate $10 by sending a text Nepal to 864233 which is UNICEF



2. RED CROSS: Go here: http://www.redcross.org.uk/nepalearthquake, and contribute according to your capability and interest



3. CARE: This verified organisation will take your money by just one click http://care.org/



4. Individual Initiative (India): http://www.nanojobs.com/donate/: A promising initiative by Saket Agarwal, who is a Pilot by profession. So, after contributing to Kashmir Floods, the young minds have created this property wherein the end point is to create Container Houses; container houses are basically earthquake proof. This blue collared job search website has 3,00,000 INR in their account so far and basic amenities like blankets and first aid boxes have already been bought and are on their way to Nepal. Harshi Agarwal says, "I think we should all come out and help. If people could contribute old shipping containers apart from regular stuff, it would be great in serving the purpose."
