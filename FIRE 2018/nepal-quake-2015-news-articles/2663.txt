The "Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon" star Michelle Yeoh is "safely home" after she was stuck in Nepal during the deadly earthquake on Saturday.

Yeoh was visiting Nepal to attend the inaugural Asia Pacific Sport Regional Congress with her partner Jean Todt.

After being stranded at the airport for a few hours, they were able to catch a flight and return home to Paris.

The 52 year old actress also vowed to do her best to help Nepal to rebuild after the devastating earthquake.
