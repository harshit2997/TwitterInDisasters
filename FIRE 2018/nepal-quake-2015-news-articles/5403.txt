Baku-APA. Singapore's Home Team contingent has concluded its mission in quake-hit Nepal in accordance with guidance from the Nepalese government, said Singapore's Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA) on Thursday, APA reports quoting Xinhua.

A 126-strong contingent, including Singapore Civil Defence Force and Singapore Police Force officers, is scheduled to return to Singapore by the end of this week.

Singapore's largest deployment for an overseas relief operation worked with Nepalese authorities and other international teams to conduct search and rescue operations in Kathmandu and Nepal's second largest city Pokhara in the last 10 days. The contingent also provided medical assistance in Gorkha, which was near the earthquake's epicenter.

MHA said that the contingent has transferred its remaining stock of medical supplies to the Singapore Red Cross team in Nepal. Its humanitarian supplies have also been given to local networks to distribute to Nepalese people in need.
