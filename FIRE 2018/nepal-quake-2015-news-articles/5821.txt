India today assured Nepal that it stands steadfastly with the quake-hit country and provide all possible assistance, as top Indian officials met the Nepalese Prime Minister and reviewed the situation.



National Security Advisor Ajit Doval and Foreign Secretary S Jaishankar today arrived here and called on Prime Minister Sushil Koirala to discuss the rescue and relief operations in the areas affected by the earthquake.



"We have taken an account of how the Nepalese government and the Nepalese Army are working and how the NDRF is assisting them with total dedication and a total sense of commitment and they have done very good work," Doval said.Soon after the quake, India rushed 16 National Disaster Response Force (NDRF) teams to Nepal each with 45 personnel to carry out rescue operations in different areas."Wherever they have been deployed, they have been able to rescue a lot of people and they have recovered some dead bodies as well. They are working very hard in difficult conditions and we are very, very proud of them," he added.Doval, who also took an aerial survey of the Gorkha district, said: "India stands steadfastly with Nepal, (and it) will give all the help possible to them.""We did take an aerial survey of the entire Gorkha district and we also went to Barpak, met local people over there and they were extremely appreciative of the work which was being done the Nepalese army and being assisted by the Indian army medical team deployed there," he told reporters.He said the people were extremely satisfied and happy with their contribution."Fortunately, they have been able to rescue most of the people there and recover the dead bodies. Only two persons were missing there in the big village with 5,000 people over there," he added.He also said that there was tremendous support and help from ex-service men of Indian army who hailed from that area."I think it is a joint contribution of every one," he added.Humanitarian efforts have poured in from all parts of the world, from the day the disaster struck the Himalayan nation, killing over 6,300 people. Nearly 14,000 people have been injured.
