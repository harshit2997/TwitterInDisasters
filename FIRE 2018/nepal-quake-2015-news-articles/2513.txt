British Red Cross launches Nepal relief operation
</headline>

26 April 2015

The British Red Cross is mounting an emergency response to support communities affected by the devastating earthquake that shook Nepal yesterday morning.

Thousands of lives have been lost to the quake – the worst to hit the region in 80 years – including staff and volunteers from the Nepal Red Cross. More than six million people living within 100 kilometres of the epicentre could potentially been affected.

Rain is predicted throughout the region over the next three days – which will only add to the numerous pressures facing an already desperate population.

The International Federation of Red Cross have launched a response, sending additional staff, and within the next few days, two cargo planes of aid. The British Red Cross is sending five people as part of the international response.

The UK’s Department for International Development (DFID) has already pledged £2m to the British Red Cross Nepal Earthquake Appeal, which will fund urgently needed relief including food, safe drinking water, emergency shelter and medical equipment.

Support is also being offered to those who have lost contact with family members following the earthquake via the International Committee of Red Cross’ family links website: http://familylinks.icrc.org/nepal-earthquake/en/Pages/Home.aspx

Ben Webster, Head of Emergencies at the British Red Cross said: “National branches of the Red Cross have teams of staff and volunteers on the ground, in all the countries affected. They are working around the clock to provide assistance to the thousands of people who have been affected by this deadly earthquake.

“Hundreds of tarpaulins and ropes have already been distributed by the Nepal Red Cross to those who’ve had to leave their homes and are camping outside. 10,000 kits of relief items are also ready for distribution.

“More supplies will be arriving soon from Red Cross warehouses in the region, and will include essentials like hygiene kits and water purification tablets.

“But as the scale of this disaster unfolds it is clear that a major international response is needed.”

Prior to the earthquake, the British Red Cross worked together with the Nepal Red Cross on a three year earthquake preparedness programme, working in sixty-six communities across the Kathmandu valley to show people what to do before, during and after earthquakes.
