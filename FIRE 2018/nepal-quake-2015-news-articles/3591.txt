CORVALLIS, Ore. -- Emergency crews in Nepal are racing the clock to save people affected by a massive earthquake that struck there over the weekend. Now, two Oregon State University students are going there to help.

Christian Nishioka and Cole Miller started planning their trip to Nepal in January long before the earthquake struck as an assignment for their Transnational Transmedia course, which requires students to document the work of organizations in developing countries.

"We take a lot for granted here in the United States," Nishioka said.

They were initially going to film a documentary about CardioStart International, a non-profit organization that provides free heart surgery and medical care for people in third world countries.

Professor Alina Padilla-Miller wondered if her students should consider backing out of the trip because of the devastation in Nepal. She said she talked to the head surgeon at CardioStart who convinced her Nishioka and Miller would be safe and should still take part in the mission.

"I feel like it's going to be a lot more impactful of a documentary just to show the aftermath of the earthquake," Nishioka said.

"I was extremely nervous, extremely scared and started thinking about it and coming to the reasoning that the people in Nepal are more scared than I am," Miller said.

In addition to filming the documentary, both students also plan to put their cameras down.

"I'm just thinking of what I can do to help," said Nishioka, "We may be staying in tents because the hotel that we were planning on staying in is completely destroyed. Right now I'm getting a lot of camping gear."

Nishioka has also started a donation drive at Oregon State to collect things like clothing, blankets, and bottled water for people in Nepal. He said the Cultural Centers on campus will have collection boxes for donations starting on Wednesday.

Nishioka and Miller leave for Nepal early Friday morning. They will return to the U.S. on May 16th.
