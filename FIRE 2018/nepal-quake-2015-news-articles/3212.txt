The Upper Iowa University is collecting donations of Nepal earthquake victims.

The collection runs through Friday, May 1, and money will go to the Red Cross.

UIU has more than 80 Nepalese students, and while most of their families have not been impacted, these students want to help their native country.

A candle light vigil will be held on the Fayette campus at 8 p.m. Tuesday, April 28. Persons may also donate funds to the Nepal earthquake relief efforts during a Lantern Festival, which is scheduled to be held prior to the ceremony.

Donations will also be collected during the UIU Choir Concert on Thursday, April 30.
