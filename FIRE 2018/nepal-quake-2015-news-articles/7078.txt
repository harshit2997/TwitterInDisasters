BANGKOK, 4 May 2015 – The government has praised the Thai people for their generosity towards earthquake victims in Nepal as donations, both in cash and kind, have continuously been sent in.

According to Deputy Government Spokesperson Maj Gen Sansern Kaewkamnerd, seven days have passed since the government launched the “Send Thai Hearts to Nepal” account at Krungthai Bank, Government House branch, on April 28 as an official channel for the public to donate their money for people affected by the powerful earthquake in Nepal. Over the period, the account has attracted more than 111 million baht.

Meanwhile, a large number of necessary items have been donated through the First Infantry Regiment, King’s Guard on Vibhavadi Rangsit Road and the Eleventh Infantry Regiment, King’s Guard in Bang Khen district. The donations received range from clothing, food, drinking water and medicine to appliances like power generators, rice cookers and tents.

Maj Gen Sansern said, on behalf of Nepal, the government would like to thank the Thai people for all the contributions made so far and that their kindness is deeply appreciated.

The Deputy Government Spokesperson also admitted that the transport of donated items to the troubled areas in Nepal is a difficult task. He, however, affirmed that the Royal Thai Armed Forces are doing all they can to ensure that the donations reach the hands of the quake survivors as soon as possible.
