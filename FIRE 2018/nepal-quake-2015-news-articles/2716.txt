Five Ukrainian nationals have been evacuated from quake-stricken Nepal, Ukrainian Foreign Ministry spokesman Yevhen Perebyinis said.

He added that the authorities had been in touch with a hundred Ukrainians staying in Nepal and another 77 citizens were inaccessible as of yet. "Re Ukrainians in Nepal: we have 177 names on our lists and 77 of them have not made contact. Updated reports say a Polish plane has evacuated five citizens," Perebyinis tweeted on Tuesday morning.

The evacuation of four Ukrainian nationals was reported on Monday. The number of Ukrainians staying in Nepal was estimated at 166 at that moment, and there was no contact with 85 of them.

The quake in Nepal has claimed over 4,000 lives.
