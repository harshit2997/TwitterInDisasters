The Manx government is to donate £100,000 to relief efforts for earthquake victims in Nepal.

The money will be sent to the UK Disasters Emergency Committee's appeal, which is funding a major international aid operation.

The quake last Saturday has affected 5.3 million people and thousands are thought to have died.

The Isle of Man International Development Committee says sending the money to the DEC will provide the most effective response to a tragic natural disaster.

The committee already has a close relationship with Nepal though funding of the Pahar Trust, an Island-based charity which supports the building of schools in the country.
