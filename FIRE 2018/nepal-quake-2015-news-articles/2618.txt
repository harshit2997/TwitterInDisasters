New Delhi, Apr 28: A fresh batch of Indians, rescued from quake-ravaged Nepal, arrived in New Delhi on Tuesday wee hours. “We are waiting here at the airport for the rest of our family to return as only the women have arrived in the first flight. All the men are in the second flight. We have not been able to contact them yet. I am happy that we have returned,” said an Indian national, Payal Agarwal.

“We had gone there for a trip but then the earthquake happened and we had to face a lot of difficulties. Earlier we were thinking that the government is not doing anything for us, but then someone called us at night yesterday and assured us that we will be rescued. So we checked for flights and were able to get one,” said another Indian national, said Nisha Rani.

Around 377 Indians had arrived in the capital on Sunday. Earlier in the day, Prime Minister Narendra Modi held a crisis management meeting along with Union Finance Minister Arun Jaitley and Union Defence Minister Manohar Parrikar. Saturday’s earthquake, which measured 7.9 on the Richter scale, resulted in the deaths of over 3800 people in Nepal, while 72 people were killed in India. The calamity, one of the worst in over 80 years, was followed by 55 aftershocks.
