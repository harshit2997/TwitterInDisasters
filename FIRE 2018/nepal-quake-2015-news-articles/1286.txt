Bagdogra: Mamata Banerjee-led Trinamool Congress (TMC) government in West Bengal has assured compensation to victims in lieu of the massive earthquake that struck Nepal and parts of northern India.

West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee, accompanied by Suresh Kumar, the principal secretary to the state Disaster Management Department, visited the affected areas around the State to assess the situation on Sunday.

The CM dubbed the earthquake as a `humanitarian crisis`, assuring that the government is doing their bit to help the affected victims.

"I have seen here that many people have suffered disability greater than 60%. People have lost limbs and have other serious injuries. The government has arranged for more beds to be put in place," Mamata Banerjee told the media here.

"The staff is working overtime as this is a humanitarian crisis. I cannot confirm the net worth of the damage. Two bridges have cracked and many buildings have also developed cracks," she added.

Suresh Kumar said the State would give Rs. 4 lakh each as compensation to family of the deceased, Rs. 2 lakh each to those with more than 60% disability.

"Rs. 1,01,000 each would be given for collapsed houses in hilly areas and Rs. 95,000 each for collapsed houses in plains. For damaged mud houses, a compensation of Rs. 3,200 each would be provided," said Kumar.

The death toll from the devastating earthquake, which hit Nepal and northern parts of India on Saturday, climbed over 2,100 today even as the rescue efforts intensified in search of the survivors.

Fresh tremors were felt across Delhi, Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, West Bengal and Assam earlier in the day after an earthquake of 6.7 magnitude hit the east of Kathmandu.

The massive earthquake and the aftershocks left behind a trail of death and destruction in Nepal`s capital Kathmandu as well as parts of India.
