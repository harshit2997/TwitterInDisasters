Dozens of B.C. firefighters helping earthquake recovery effort in Nepal

A team of firefighters from Burnaby and Mission are in Nepal this week, as part of an international effort to help in the aftermath of the devastating earthquake that left thousands of people dead.

Two firefighters from the Mission Fire Department and 20 members of the Burnaby Fire Department left B.C. on Monday for the capital city of Kathmandu.

Mission Fire Chief Larry Watkinson is working as part of a team completing damage assessments for a 12-kilometre radius around Kathmandu. In an email Friday to The Vancouver Sun from Nepal, he said they are working with disaster dogs and with the Canadian medical assistant team.

He didn’t want to comment on the exact details of operations until they arrive home because he said the situation "is so complex.”

The firefighters from B.C. have extensive training in disaster response. They are equipped with specialized dogs, cameras that can provide views inside the crevices of collapsed buildings, and seismic equipment that can detect the vibration of a survivor tapping on a brick deep below the surface.

They are also searching for the bodies of victims of the magnitude 7.8 quake that struck Saturday. The dogs use different signals to indicate whether a buried person is alive or dead.

Meantime Friday, the B.C. government announced it would donate $300,000 to The Red Cross to support emergency disaster relief efforts in Nepal. It also said residents can donate to the cause at any of the 196 B.C. liquor stores in the province until June 6.

Nepal is renewing its appeal to international donors to send tents and tarpaulins for temporary shelter along with grain, salt and sugar.

The U.N. humanitarian chief, Valerie Amos told reporters at the U.N. compound in Nepal’s capital Friday that aid workers face “immense logistical challenges” trying to get aid to mountainside villages where helicopters couldn’t land and where some roads were destroyed.

Amos saw some of the isolated Himalayan villages by air Friday during her visit to the country hit by an earthquake April 25 that caused more than 6,200 deaths.

The U.N. humanitarian office says more than 130,000 houses were reported destroyed.

The Canadian government has also sent a disaster assessment team to Nepal and is contributing $5 million to relief efforts. Vancouver’s Heavy Urban Search and Rescue task force is also ready to deploy to Nepal, but has not yet been called to go.
