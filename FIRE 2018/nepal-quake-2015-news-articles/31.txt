Israel will send a rescue team to Nepal in the wake of the massive earthquake, a military statement said.

The mission is expected to leave Saturday night at the instruction of Chief of Staff Lieutenant General Gadi Eisenkot, according to the military statement.

"Israel Defense Force will send an advance team in order to determine the extent of the IDF assistance required in Nepal," the statement read.

Director General of the Foreign Ministry Nissim Ben Shitrit said in a special press conference on Saturday afternoon that some 200 Israelis were out of contact since the 7.9-magnitude tremor hit some 80.5 km (50 miles) north-west of Kathmandu.

Overall, some 2,000 Israelis are currently in Nepal but no casualties were reported among them, Bet Shitrit added.

At least 1,400 people were reported dead across Nepal, making it the worst earthquake the poverty-stricken nation saw over the past 80 years. Endit
