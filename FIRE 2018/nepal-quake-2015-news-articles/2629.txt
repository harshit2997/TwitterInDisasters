The Chief Prelate of the Malwathu Chapter of the Siam Sect Most Venerable Thibbatuwawe Sri Sumangala Thero points out that the loss of life and property and injuries which were the result of the earthquake in Nepal has caused much sorrow in the hearts of the Maha Sangha, and all Buddhists.

The Chief Prelate issued a message of solace.

In his message, the Chief Prelate says that the destruction caused to a neighbouring country is felt as if it had taken place here in Sri Lanka.

The Most Venerable Thibbatuwawe Sri Sumangala Thero says that that measures taken by the President and the three armed forces to dispatch relief teams to Nepal and taking other relief measures is a mark of gratitude.

The most venerable thero expressed his appreciation of the initiatives.

The most venerable thero, in his message of solace, wishes that the Land of Buddha be blessed by the Triple Gem and the Sacred Relics.
