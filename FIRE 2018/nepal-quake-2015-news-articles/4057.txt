Patna: CM Nitish Kumar on Thursday flagged off 10 truckloads of relief items for quake victims in Nepal after personally inspecting their packaging at S K Memorial Hall here. Nitish directed the officials supervising the packing of food packets to do it sincerely as the relief items were being sent for people who had suffered and survived the quake disaster which claimed hundreds of lives and injured thousands.As explained by Patna DM Abhay Kumar Singh, each relief packet included 2kg of chura, 250gm of sugar, 100gm of salt, a biscuits packet, 200gm of Sudha milk powder and an Eveready torch. Overall, the relief items included 208 bags of chura, 258 cartons of biscuits, 250 cartons of Maggi, 750 cartons of drinking water, 1,500 blankets and 25 tents, he added.The CM said people in Nepal not only suffered the quake of high intensity, but also a series of aftershocks. If the epicentre had been in the plains, the devastations caused in Bihar and Uttar Pradesh would have been very extensive and loss of lives on enormous scale, he added.He said the plan was to send relief packages by air to Simra in Nepal, but due to snag, they were now being sent by road. The relief packets were also being prepared at Sitamarhi and Bettiah while blankets and bedsheets were also being sent to Raxaul from Muzaffarpur. The CM appealed to people of the state to contribute liberally to the CM Relief Fund and also in kind to provide aid and assistance to the people of Nepal.Appealing to people to construct quake-resistant houses, the CM said people do it in Japan, prone to earthquake. The CM also appealed to engineers to get trained in making quake-resistant houses and spread this concept as every big disaster is also an occasion for learning to face the future in a more planned way.CM Nitish Kumar on Thursday donated his one month's salary of Rs 1 lakh for the earthquake victims in the state. The CM handed over the cheque to Chanchal Kumar, the in-charge of CM Relief Fund and secretary to CM. Nitish also appealed to his ministerial colleagues and others to come forward and donate for the earthquake victims and their families.
