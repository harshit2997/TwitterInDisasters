Major appeal launched after devastating Nepal earthquake

A major appeal has been launched today (Tuesday, April 28) by leading UK aid agencies to help survivors of the Nepal earthquake.

The Disasters Emergency Committee (DEC) Nepal Earthquake Appeal, fronted by actress Joanna Lumley, will support the efforts of DEC members to reach families affected by the 7.8 magnitude quake which struck west of the capital Kathmandu on Saturday (April 25).

Ms Lumley said: “Like so many others watching the shocking images from Nepal over the last few days, I’m deeply saddened by events and my thoughts are with all those struggling to survive.

“The Nepalese are a resilient people but this catastrophe has hit them very hard. They’re desperately in need of life-saving help and I hope people in the UK will support us.”

The death toll has risen above 3,600 and is expected to rise still further with 5.3 million people living in areas hit by severe shaking.

Aftershocks have been felt with remote villages still to be reached, cut-off by landslides and communications wiped out.

All 13 DEC member agencies have joined the appeal and are starting to get life-saving aid to those most in need.

The first £5 million of public donations to the DEC Nepal Earthquake Appeal will be matched by UK aid through the Department for International Development.

DEC chief executive Saleh Saeed said: “The sheer scale of this emergency and the effort required to help the people of Nepal recover is only now becoming clear.

“Survivors are in need of medical help, food, water and shelter. In many cases they’ve lost everything and our members are ready to help them not just survive but to rebuild their lives.”
