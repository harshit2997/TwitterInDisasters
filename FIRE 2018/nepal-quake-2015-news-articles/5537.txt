STAMFORD, Conn. (WTNH) – Aid organization AmeriCares airlifted 15 tons of emergency medical aid to Kathmandu today to resupply hospitals dealing with hundreds of earthquake survivors. The plane has arrived with nearly $1 million dollars in urgently needed antibiotics, pain relievers, bandages, crutches and other medical and surgical equipment. Thousands of children and adults are being treated for injuries from the April 25th earthquake.

According to AmeriCares, nearly 90 percent of the medical facilities in that area have heavy damage from the quake. An AmeriCares emergency response team from India arrived in Kathmandu within 48 hours of the quake and started treating survivors in the streets.

“Our medical teams are treating an average of 120 patients a day,” AmeriCares Senior Vice President of Global Programs Dr. E. Anne Peterson said from Kathmandu where she is working on the relief efforts. “We are seeing children with trauma injuries, diarrhea, fever and respiratory illnesses who haven’t had access to a doctor. We are committed to restoring health services for survivors.”

AmeriCares has been aiding survivors of natural disasters, political conflict and extreme poverty around the world for more than 30 years, saving lives and restoring health and hope. To donate to AmeriCares Nepal Relief Fund go to www.americares.org/nepalearthquake or call 1(800) 486-HELP.
