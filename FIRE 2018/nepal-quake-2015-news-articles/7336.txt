Nepal: HPIC continuing to respond
</headline>

<text>
Yesterday (May 13), 10 Physician Travel Packs or enough essential medicines and medical supplies to provide up to 6,000 treatments left for Nepal with International Medical Corps. It is expected to arrive this weekend.

A Mother-Child Health Kit, consisting of basic supplies, equipment and over the counter medicines to provide safe births, will also be leaving this weekend with Canadian Medical Assistance Teams (CMAT). The first CMAT team brought 4 Physician Travel Packs on May 2.

“The death toll from the first earthquake had reached more than 8,000 people and had crippled the country when another earthquake struck on Tuesday, May 12- injuring close to 2,000 people and killing more people,” said Alexandra Wilson, HPIC’s Manager of Emergency Relief.

“The international community’s response to the earthquake has faced a number of challenges, ranging from accessing harder to reach rural areas to logistical difficulties of bringing needed commodities into the country. Nepal is serviced by one small airport in Kathmandu that has been overwhelmed and damaged by large, incoming cargo flights. As such, there are significant delays in getting aid into the country,” Wilson explained.

To date, HPIC has had a great response from our donors, both financially and with offers of medicine donations. “HPIC continues to work with our global network of partners to see how best we can respond to identified needs on the ground,” Wilson said.

The following companies all donated medicines specifically to the emergency appeal for Nepal: Allergan, AstraZeneca, GSK, Johnson and Johnson, Paladin, Pfizer, Pharmascience, Sunovian, and Teva.

Every $1 donated to HPIC provides at least $10 of essential medicine. Donate to Nepal medical relief.
