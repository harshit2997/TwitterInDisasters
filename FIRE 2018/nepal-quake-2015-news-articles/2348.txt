NEW DELHI: Did the intelligence agencies let down home minister Rajnath Singh minutes after he praised their skills and capabilities? For, Singh, to whom the Intelligence Bureau reports, got to know of the earthquake only after Prime Minister Narendra Modi called him and asked him to attend a meeting he had convened in the wake of the "big tragedy"."The prime minister told me that he had called a meeting at 3 pm. A big tragedy has happened and you would have received the information," Singh said in Lok Sabha on Monday, referring to his conversation with the PM that led him to switch on the television and learn of the devastating earthquake."I have no hesitation in admitting this in the House that I was not aware about this till I reached home (after an event). But the prime minister had already received the information... Honestly, the promptness I should have shown as home minister and the information I should have got were not there," he said as he lauded Modi's quick response.Singh was with the prime minister for the inauguration of National Intelligence Academy in Dwarka minutes before the tremors rocked Nepal and many north Indian states. While Modi's carcade left the venue at 11.30 am, Singh's car followed minutes later. The earthquake struck at 11.41 am but, being in transit, the home minister did not feel it. He reached his residence in another 10 minutes, but all this while, remained unaware of the tragedy that had shook the nation and its neighbourhood.Modi's call served as Singh's first source of information about the quake.Singh's admission on Monday left proactive elements in the bureaucracy wondering if there was anything amiss about response of the intelligence agencies that are mandated to gather and pass on every important piece of information to the home minister. The alleged oversight is even more glaring as not only does IB have a good penetration in Nepal but even the Sashastra Seema Bal, in charge of securing the Indo-Nepal border, operates under the home ministry.Minutes before the quake, Singh had praised the agencies, stating how their getting to know about Modi's plan to take the Metro attested to their improved intelligence gathering skills and capabilities. This had led Modi to light-heartedly remark how Singh was keeping tabs on him.
