‘Crawl 4 Nepal’ Invites You To Drink Beer For A Good Cause
</headline>

<text>
LOS ANGELES (CBSLA.com) — As images of Nepal’s devastating earthquake flooded the news the past few weeks, many wonder how they can help.

A local group of craft beer bloggers has answered that call with a pub crawl. They say the “Crawl 4 Nepal” fundraiser will please your palette and warm your heart.

“The craft beer community has always been really community-oriented and really supportive of causes and give a lot back to the community. So this is just another showing of that,” beer blogger Kelly Erickson told CBS2/KCAL9.

They’ve recruited breweries across three counties to take part in Saturday’s event. Each spot will designate one of their draft beers as the donation beer, with 100 percent of the proceeds going toward relief efforts.

More than 7,000 people have died in the 7.8-magnitude temblor and hundreds of thousands have been rendered homeless.

The following bars are participating in the fundraiser:

• Eagle Rock Brewery

• Golden Road Brewing

• Mohawk Bend

• Tony’s Darts Away

• Sunset Beer Company

• The Rookery Ale House

• Ritual Brewing Co.

• Barley Forge Brewing Co.

• Sanctum Brewing Co.

• Beach City Brewery

• Bottle Logic Brewing

• Phantom Carriage

• Blue Palms Brewhouse

• Three Weavers Brewing Co.

• King Harbor Brewing Co.
