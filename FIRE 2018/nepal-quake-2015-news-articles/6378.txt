Chinese relief supplies continue to flood into Nepal, in which more than 8,000 people were killed and 17,800 injured when the quake struck on April 25.

Over the weekend, some 460 tonnes of relief materials arrived in Nepal from China.

BIGGEST OVERSEAS HUMANITARIAN MILITARY MISSIONS

China has sent 1,088 military personnel and members of armed police -- the largest such group it has dispatched to foreign soil for humanitarian aid missions since 1949.

The People's Liberation Army (PLA) Air Force has deployed eight transport planes to carry a total of 416 tonnes of relief supplies to Nepal.

Three air force helicopters flew to Nepal last week to help with transportation and rescue, and they carried 190 pieces of engineering machinery.

The Chinese army will continue to send relief supplies to Nepal and intensify decontamination and medical services to prevent diseases, according to Zheng Weibo, director of the emergency response office of the PLA's General Staff Headquarters.

"As a neighbor, China will do its best to help Nepal's government and people to pull through the difficulties and reconstruct their home," said Huang Xilian, deputy head of the Foreign Ministry's Department of Asian Affairs.

China has also sent seven medical and rescue teams, which have helped diagnose and treat locals and assisted the Nepalese to formulate a post-disaster health and epidemic prevention plan.

China is also considering sending experts to help local psychologists counsel victims.

A 62-member China International Search & Rescue Team, as well as six sniffer dogs, landed in Beijing on Friday after a 13-day mission in which they were the first foreign team to save a survivor in the quake field.
