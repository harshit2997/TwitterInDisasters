KUNMING, April 29 (Xinhua) -- A 59-member medical team left Kunming City, Yunnan Province, for Nepal on Wednesday afternoon to join relief efforts.

It was the second government medical team sent by China to Nepal after the 8.1-magnitude earthquake on Saturday.

The group includes experts in public hygiene, infectious diseases, traumatology, orthopaedics and emergency treatment, all from Yunnan Province.

"More than 80 percent of our team members have earthquake-relief experience," said Lu Lin, team head. They are able to carry out relief efforts even without water or electricity.

On Monday, the first medical team sent by China from Sichuan Province arrived in Nepal. As of Tuesday, it had treated 83 people.

The death toll from Saturday's earthquake in Nepal has climbed to more than 5,000 people, according to reports.

The death toll in China's Tibet Autonomous Region from the quake has risen to 25.
