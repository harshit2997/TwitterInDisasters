RICHMOND (NEWS1130) – A second Canadian medical team has boarded a flight from YVR to Nepal following a second massive earthquake to rock that country in the past few weeks. The help is badly needed as the death toll continues to climb.

Brian Taylor is part of the team of doctors, nurses and paramedics heading over. He says they don’t have a lot of information about what they’ll be dealing with when they get on the ground.

He adds they’re fully aware that more aftershocks may hit in the coming days.

“I can’t say I’m emotionally prepared. At my regular job, we deal with emergencies and so I’m just going to be ready to deal with whatever happens.”

Mark Hyslop, a retired ER doctor and the team’s leader, says no one knows what the conditions will be like when they land. He went to Haiti to help five years ago, adding they’re ready, regardless of the situation they’ll face.

“We’re ready for a lot of destruction, a lot of people that are in trouble because they’re homeless or they don’t want to go back inside their houses. And monsoon season is coming up, so we’ll have to be prepared for that.”

According to UNICEF, there are roughly 12 babies born every hour without basic health care because of the two quakes and within the next month,18,000 moms and babies could be at risk.

“The number of mothers giving birth outside hospitals and birthing centres is feared to have gone up by more than a third in the worst-affected areas of the country since last month’s earthquake hit,” says Tomoo Hozumi, UNICEF’s Representative in Nepal.

“The first days of life are the most critical and dangerous for a child and we are extremely concerned for the well-being of newborns, as well as for their mothers.”

More than 8,000 people are dead and tens of thousands of others are injured.
