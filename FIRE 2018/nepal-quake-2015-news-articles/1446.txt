KATMANDU, April 27 (Xinhua) -- A 58-strong Chinese Government Medical Team arrived in Nepal Monday morning to carry out a humanitarian mission after the country was struck by a powerful earthquake at midday Saturday.

The medical team, from Sichuan province, is the first of its kind dispatched to Nepal by the Chinese government.

The medical team comprises experts from medical, pharmacy, osteology, nursing and psychology departments, among others.

They brought with them 13 tons of medical aids and they are expected to stay in Nepal for about 10 days to carry out the humanitarian mission.

The 7.9-magnitude quake jolted central, western, mid-western and far-western parts of Nepal, which was followed by at least 15 strong aftershocks, with the last one of 6.7 magnitude occurred Sunday afternoon.

The quake has also caused properties damages worth billions of U.S. dollar in the country.

Four Chinese nationals, including two workers with a Chinese company, a mountain climber and a tourist, were killed and five others seriously injured in the quake, the Chinese Embassy has confirmed.

Rescue operations are underway by the Nepal Army, Police and Armed Police Force.

An emergency cabinet meeting has announced 29 districts in the country as crisis zones, according to the Home Ministry.

The powerful quake also jolted neighboring India and Bangladesh.

Amid the devastating disaster, the government of Nepal has appealed for assistance from the international community.

A 62-strong China International Search and Rescue Team arrived in Nepal on Sunday to carry out the humanitarian mission.
