Manawatu residents give to Nepal after quake

David Unwin/ Fairfax NZ Awatapu College students hold a bake sale and second hand books to raise money for Nepal. Frank Lawton and Heather Milner right buy some baking from Zara Gribbon and Aaron Hefford.

Palmerston North punters have loosened their purse strings following the devastating earthquakes in Nepal.

More than $13,000 has been raised in the city since the April 25 quake left more than 8000 dead.

Awatapu College held fundraising events across three days this week, raising $2000 for the Nepalese community.

There was a mufti day on Wednesday where students were encouraged to dress in the colours of the Nepalese flag - blue, white and red. They also held a bake and book sale on Thursday and Friday.

Aaron Hefford, 18, and Zara Gribbin, 17, who were both members of the student council, said they felt they needed to help the people of Nepal after the the 7.8 magnitude earthquake.

They said they were surprised by how generous the students had been.

"Usually on a mufti day we average around $350. So we tripled it," Hefford said.

"They're already a poor country and we were like, we have to do something," Gribbin said.

Hefford said he spent a few weeks in Tibet in 2014.

The school has four students from Nepal and a teacher-aid, Prakroto Bhattarai, who had moved from Kathmandu to Palmerston North in March.

Most of the reported fatalities were in villages and towns east of Kathmandu.

Bhattarai said she was grateful to the community for helping out.

Her family had been living outside in a tent since the first quake. She also had a family member who died in the first shake.

"When you know that everyone is effected you feel lucky that you are alive."

Red Cross cultural worker Bikram Pandey said donations via major supermarkets and sausage sizzles at UCOL and Massey University had raised more than $13,000 for Nepal.

He said $1500 was going to Birkam Phuyal, one of the members of the Nepalese community in Palmerston North, whose house where his parents lived was destroyed by the earthquake.

It had taken him two days to get through to his family to find out they were safe.

The remaining donations, totalling $11,633.15, were given to NZ Red Cross.

Pandey said the Nepalese community expressed its sincere gratitude to the broader community of Palmerston North for the overwhelming generosity shown towards the people of Nepal through donations or providing spaces for collection of donations.

Along with donations, Palmerston North company Prepared Foods New Zealand, a subsidiary of Aotearoa Fisheries, made 100,000 ready to eat curries to be sent to the affected areas.
