More than 5,200 are dead and thousands have been left homeless following the earthquake in Nepal.

The CDC has recommended that U.S. residents avoid all nonessential travel to the country. But that doesn't include humanitarian aid work and Wednesday a group of East Texans prepared to make their way to the devastation and assist in relief efforts.

Blankets, tarps and medical equipment are just a few of the items being packed for delivery.

John Mark Ambler is one of six men taking supplies to earthquake victims in Nepal.

"People need to know that other people care and that they're loved and of we can go and represent Christ's compassion for them that's the biggest thing," Ambler said.

The volunteer team is part of the MercyWorks organization, which assist with relief efforts after natural disasters.

MercyWorks Director Debbie Lascelles said the organization has sent volunteers into areas like the Philippines, Haiti and Japan.

"Just to love in them and be the hands and feet of Jesus when they need it most," Lascelles said.

Lascelles said the group will be sending three teams to Nepal over the next few weeks.

The first team is leaving Friday, and their job is to find out where they can best lend a hand.

"They don't know where they are going to be sleeping yet and they don't know what exactly they are going to do but that's their job to figure that out for the teams that will follow," Lascelles said.

Ambler said he found out he was going on the trip Tuesday and some of the biggest needs are medical equipment and tarps. But he hopes to bring more than just supplies.

"Material aid is a great thing that's needed that's part of it but I think just to have a human touch too is really big," Ambler said.

The first group will be in Nepal until May 10th and the next group departs on the 11th.

Officials said in these types of disasters they can send up to 10 teams to aid the hurting communities. Lascelles said their overall goal is to find the good in the ruins.

â€œGod is able to bring beauty from ashes and that's what we're expecting to see in Nepal too," Lascelles said.

Volunteers are paying their own way to Nepal so 100 percent of monetary donations will go to relief efforts.
