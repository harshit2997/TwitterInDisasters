National Security Advisor Ajit Doval, who held talks with Nepal Prime Minister Sushil Koirala on Friday, said India will stand by the Nepalese people and help them in every way

"The talks were very good. We told him we will stand by them and we will help them in every way. The Nepal prime Minister expressed gratitude for this. India's help has made it possible for the relief efforts to reach far flung places in just six days," said Doval.

The National Security Advisor added that Prime Minister Narendra Modi had expressed solidarity towards the Nepal quake victims and their families.

"Prime Minister Modi's first message is of solidarity towards the people of Nepal and his empathy towards the families who have lost their loved ones," said Doval.

"The second message is that we will work dedicatedly to help the people and the government of Nepal," he added.

Doval, who is in Kathmandu with Foreign Secretary S. Jaishankar, also reviewed the National Disaster Response Force (NDRF) rescue and relief operations in the areas affected by the earthquake.
