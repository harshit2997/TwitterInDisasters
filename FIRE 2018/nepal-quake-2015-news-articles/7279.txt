Charikot (Nepal), May 14 (Reuters): A Nepali woman seriously injured by falling debris in Tuesday's earthquake was airlifted to a Kathmandu hospital today in the Prime Minister's helicopter, after two British paramedics pleaded with officials to help save her life.

Prime Minister Sushil Koirala was on a visit to Charikot town in Dolakha district, around 70km east of Kathmandu. As Koirala sat in an army tent where he was being briefed by officials on the rescue effort, a few metres away two advanced paramedics were hand-pumping oxygen into a middle-aged woman at a small, makeshift medical camp, keeping her alive.

The paramedics said they had spent an hour pleading with army officials to tell Koirala that his helicopter was needed to transport the woman to a hospital in the capital.

"I said: 'If I stop doing this, this lady will die. Do you understand?'," paramedic Phil Llewellyn, who arrived in Nepal on May 5 to help with the relief effort, recalled telling a Nepali army official.

The paramedics eventually spoke to the helicopter's pilot, who informed the prime minister. Within seconds, Nepali soldiers dashed out of the tent where they had been briefing Koirala, loaded the woman on to a stretcher and put her on board the helicopter, along with the paramedics.
