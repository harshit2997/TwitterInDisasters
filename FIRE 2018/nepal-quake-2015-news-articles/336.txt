Dozens of Britons are among those missing following an earthquake in Nepal that triggered a massive avalanche on Mount Everest.

A 7.9 magnitude earthquake close to the Nepalese capital of Kathmandu struck just before midday, killing at least 1,130 across four countries including Pakistan, Bangladesh and India.

At least 18 of those were pulled from the Everest avalanche today, and there are up to 70 British climbers still unaccounted for after the snow buried part of the mountain’s base camp.

‘The toll could go up. It may include foreigners as well as sherpas,’ Nepal’s Tourism Ministry warned.

The Mirror reports that six of the eight teams of Britons climbing Everest with travel firm Jagged Globe are missing.

A British Army team also on Everest were today said to be safe at the Advanced Base Camp.

‘We are in close contact with the Nepalese government,’ said foreign secretary Philip Hammond.

‘The British Embassy in Nepal is offering consular assistance to British Nationals.’
