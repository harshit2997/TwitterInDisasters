PHOENIX — On Mother's Day, Marine Lance Cpl. Jacob "Jake" Hug of Phoenix figured out a way to call his mother from the other side of the world.

The Marine was somewhere in Nepal, helping the U.S. humanitarian effort after the first of two earthquakes that have killed more than 8,000 people and destroyed 600,000 homes.

Late Tuesday, shortly after a second earthquake struck the country, the UH-1Y Huey helicopter Hug was aboard disappeared. Its wreckage, in pieces, and three bodies were found Friday in the mountains about 50 miles northeast of Nepal's capital, Kathmandu.

The Marine's family and friends now await word on Hug, the five other Marines and two Nepalese army soldiers aboard the aircraft. The outlook is grim, officials said.

The 22-year-old based in Okinawa, Japan, was on temporary assignment in Nepal for about a week before the helicopter disappeared.

Hug and the others were taking tarps, rice and other supplies to remote locations in Charikot, the area worst hit in Tuesday's 7.3-magnitude quake that has killed 117 people so far and injured more than 2,800. The U.S. relief mission was deployed soon after a magnitude-7.8 quake hit April 25, killing more than 8,200 people.

Hug, a combat videographer, also was taking footage of relief efforts for the Defense Department.

"Between the first stop and the second stop, the helicopter reported an issue with the fuel line, and then being in such a remote location, it just disappeared," said his father, Jim Hug. "There's no signs of a crash, no signs of smoke, no signs of a fire. The emergency beacon didn't go on."

Jim Hug said he is encouraged that his son and Jacob's fellow Marines are well trained for survival.

The aircraft was equipped with a first-aid kit, fire extinguisher and a radio, Army Maj. David Eastburn, U.S. Pacific Command spokesman, told ABC News. Marine air crews typically are equipped with other survival items, including cold-weather clothing, fire starters, compasses, flexible saws and tourniquets, he said.

"We have hope that they're out there surviving," Jim Hug said.

Jake Hug spent May 6, his 22nd birthday, in Nepal contributing to the relief effort, a few days before he called his mother, Andrea Hug, on Mother's Day.

"I don't know how he even found access because he had been sleeping underneath a tarp on the ground for a week," his father said. "He said he was tired and he was ready to go back, and just all the nice things that a great son would say to his mother on Mother's Day."

Jake Hug left for basic training just months after graduating from high school, said his uncle, Tim Hug. The young man felt a sense of duty to his country and was happy in the Marines.

"Jacob is a great kid. All he wanted to do was go into the military," his uncle said.

Before joining the Marines, Jake Hug worked part time in the produce section of a Safeway grocery. Jim Hug serves as a district manager for the chain. He kept boxes of books and read them two or three times each.

"He's a bookworm. You don't see Jacob without a book in his hand," his uncle said, adding that the young man read everything from Harry Potter to the classics.

Jacob comes from a large family, including sister Courtney, 22; brothers Zach, 20, and Nathan 17; and twin brother and sister Carter and Sydney, 7. They adore him, Jim Hug said.

"They seek him out. They talk about him all the time," their dad said. "They mention him in their prayers at night."
