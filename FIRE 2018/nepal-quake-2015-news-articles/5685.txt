Teenage earthquake survivor calls for donations to disaster fund

A TEENAGER from Cleadon who was caught up in the Nepal earthquake has been reunited with her mother, after she touched down on UK soil on a flight out of the disaster zone.

It was an emotional reunion for Megan Evans as the tearful 18-year-old hugged her mother Michelle, a GP, after touching down at Stansted Airport at 3am yesterday.

People need to donate. There’s so many people suffering out there that just need help.

The teenager was one of more than 124 British survivors met by jubilant family and friends, as they arrived back on home soil.

Megan was doing voluntary work as a teacher in Kathmandu during her gap year, when she was caught up in the carnage.

She told of her fight for life when the 7.8 magnitude quake struck on Saturday.

She said: “We had to run across the room and we got under a table. You just saw the wall crack. I thought someone was going to have to dig us out.”

Having seen the devastation first-hand, Megan has now appealed for fellow Britons to help with the aid effort.

She said: “People need to donate. There’s so many people suffering out there that just need help.

“They have no water, no food they are just on the streets and scared of going in their houses.

“That’s their life now. We were lucky enough to get out and the British Army helped us so much. We’re so thankful, but it just doesn’t seem right in a way.”

Megan was also reunited with other family members, including her dog Leo, in the early hours of the morning.

Dr Evans, who is based at the Farnham Medical Centre, in Stanhope Road, South Shields, said: “It’s fantastic to have her home, Megan’s main worry are the people in Nepal.

“They have no choice to leave and they have to rebuild their lives.”

The Boeing 767 flew out of Nepal on Sunday, organised by the Foreign Office, and many of those on board were elderly and children – including a four-month-old baby.
