CHARLOTTE - Nepali families in Charlotte are coming together to rush aid to their home country.



Members of the greater Charlotte Nepalese Association tell Channel 9 they are communicating with aid workers in Nepal. A doctor from their group flew from Charlotte to Nepal to help directly.

They've focused their efforts on meeting the greatest needs. Right now they say people need medical help.



Sushil Nepal and his friends have spent the past day gathering in Charlotte but their hearts are with Nepal.



“They were terrified; you couldn't get off the building, it was shaking so much,” Adit Upadhyay said.



Members of the group with relatives in Nepal say their parents are sleeping outside in the elements, forced out of their homes by Saturday’s deadly earthquake.



“I think they're just trying to survive. They are terrified and unsure of what's happening next,” Upadhyay said.



That's where this group is hoping to make a difference. They were in the middle of forming the Greater Charlotte Nepalese Association to unify roughly 4,000 Nepalese in the area when the quake forced them to act.



“One of our community members here, her grandmother, as she tried to run away, unfortunately she passed away,” Nepal said.



Heartbreaking stories from their hometowns motivated the group members to funnel their fear and frustration into coordinating a relief effort. They picked up their phones and started building partnerships with national nonprofits to pump critical resources into the disaster zone.



“Painkillers, a tetanus shot, bandages. Those are the things we need,” Nepal said.



Sunday, two of their members were on their way to help with medical needs, one step on their journey to support Nepal’s recovery.



“We feel proud of what we've done so far but there will a lot that needs to be done,” Upadhyay said.



The group will give updates via their Facebook page, information on how to donate to their relief efforts can also be found.



A vigil for the victims will be on Wednesday. The address is:

International House

1817 Central Ave #215

Charlotte, NC 28205
