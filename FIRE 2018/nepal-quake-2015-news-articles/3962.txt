A massive earthquake in Nepal Saturday left many tourists and volunteers stranded, leaving families anxiously waiting.

The anticipation kept building for Tarun Rao of Folsom. He spent his Tuesday morning at San Francisco International Airport waiting for his wife to return from Nepal.

"It was a traumatic three-day experience for all of us," Rao said.

His wife was one of six members from Intel stuck in the quake-ravaged region. The group traveled to Nepal more than two weeks to volunteer for an education service project. They documented their work through a blog site â€“ posting pictures before and after the magnitude 7.8 quake hit.

That's when getting a hold of them became difficult.

"They had one phone between the six of them, but they were very strong," Rao said. "They kept their spirits high and kept going."

Kathmandu Airport was packed with people trying to flee the country.

"There was just a lot of people and a lot of waiting, and luckily it stayed pretty sane most of the time," said Kirk Hansen of Fair Oaks.

He kept his calm amid the chaos. His team was supposed to fly out Sunday but they never made it past the boarding pass counter. After days of waiting, their biggest relief came when they saw their plane.

"It circled for three and a half hours outside of Kathmandu and then got redirected to India to get refueled and actually came back," Hansen said. "When it actually finally touched down, that was the big cheer, we have a plane on the ground."

The team got to SFO Tuesday morning, providing much needed relief to family members.

"There are a lot of people who are still stuck out there, so I'm just happy she made it back safely," Rao said.

"Feels good to finally be home and be able to hopefully soon see my wife and my families," Hansen said.
