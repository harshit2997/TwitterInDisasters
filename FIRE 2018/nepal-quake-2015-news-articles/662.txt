Washington: The US today sent a military aircraft with relief materials and nearly 70 rescue workers to Nepal to provide assistance after the powerful earthquake that killed more than 2,400 people.

The C-17 Globemaster aircraft left Dover Air Force Base in Delaware around this morning for Nepal. It is expected to land in Nepal tomorrow.

"The aircraft is transporting nearly 70 personnel including a USAID Disaster Assistance Response Team (DART), the Fairfax County Urban Search and Rescue team and several journalists along with 45 square tonnes of cargo," Pentagon spokesman Colonel Steven Warren said.

The initial estimated cost of the Department of Defence's support mission is USD 700,000, and there are currently no other requests for intervention, officials said.

There are 26 American defence personnel and one US C-130 in Nepal who were there to conduct a previously scheduled training exercise. No member of the US military is known to be missing in the quake.
