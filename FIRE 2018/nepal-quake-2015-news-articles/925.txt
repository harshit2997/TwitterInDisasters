Report by: BBC News

More than 1,000 people have been killed in Nepalâ€™s deadliest earthquake for more than 80 years.

The 7.8 magnitude quake struck an area of central Nepal between the capital, Kathmandu, and the city of Pokhara.

There were also victims in India, Bangladesh, Tibet and on Mount Everest, where avalanches were triggered.

The government has declared a state of emergency in the affected areas, and help has been offered by countries around the world.

Little information has emerged from the epicentre, where extensive damage has been reported, and there are fears the death toll could rise yet further.

The Nepalese information minister has told the BBC that 1,500 people had been killed in the disaster, but that the true casualty figure would probably be much higher.

Thousands of people are spending the night outside their houses, following a series of aftershocks.
