Charity seeks Hong Kong volunteers to help with Nepal earthquake counselling

A Hong Kong counselling charity is calling for volunteers to step forward and aide the recovery of the largely affected Nepalese communities shattered by the earthquake zone.

The Post-Crisis Counselling Network (PCCN) wants to train large numbers of volunteers in counselling skills, particularly psychotherapy – to eventually send them to Nepal.

A Nepal government official predicted the death toll could exceed 10,000, with 4,800 lives lost in Saturday’s devastating earthquake so far, including one Hong Kong man among the victims.

The first batch of volunteers – up to 140 people – from Hong Kong are due to fly to Kathmandu by May 13 and will help to provide counselling.

Timothy To Wing-ching, the charity’s director, said it was vital for volunteers to step forward.

“If people have trauma and they don’t have any treatment, assessment or professional people to help, if they pass two or three years, the mental trauma will be worse,” he warned.

Within one year, the organisation has an ambitious target to see up to 200,000 survivors suffering from post-traumatic stress-related disorders treated.

Among them, people could be affected by a phobia of another earthquake, aftershocks or mudslides, panic through rebuilding lives with little money or resources to do so, sadness through the deaths of friends and family, and complicated trauma though religious disbelief plus a combination of phobia, sadness and panic.

Volunteers who successfully compete the training will also be tasked to provide training to local people to help them get back on a stable footing.

The overall campaign is expected to cost around HK$2 million, funded by donations from citizens and corporates.

PCCN has previously provided assistance after the 2011 Japanese tsunami and 2013 Super Typhoon Haiyan in the Philippines. In 2008 and 2013, the charity helped train a combined 500 counsellors to provide long-term support.
