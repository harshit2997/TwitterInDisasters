The Chinese army and Chinese armed police forces conducted disaster relief in Tibet Autonomous Region and Nepal since the devastating quake struck outside Kathmandu on April 25, military officials told reporters on Wednesday.

Deng Weibo, head of the emergency management office of the Chinese People’s Liberation Army General Staff, explained the efforts were a first for armed police from the Chengdu Military Area Command.

Rescue efforts were concentrated in Tibet’s Dingri, Zhangmu and Gyirong counties. Engineering and medical teams also joined the operations.

Currently there are over 6,600 soldiers and armed police participating in rescue efforts, including about 900 organized militias and nine helicopters. So far more than 12,000 injured have been rescued and 49,000 given temporary housing.

More than 5,200 tents have been set up in Tibet, and epidemic prevention measures have already been conducted over an area of 11 million square meters.

At the same time, three groups totaling 560 army personnel were sent to Nepal, including more than 50 members from the China International Search and Rescue Team was sent to Nepal on April 26.

The next day, the No.14 Army Engineer Corps and the Chengdu Military Area Command medical team arrived in Kathmandu, followed by the No.14 Army Chemical Defense Unit and Armed Transportation Troop were sent to Nepal.

Eight IL-76 air force transport aircraft transported emergency supplies, while three military helicopters from No.14 Army were used in rescue operations. A coordination group was sent to the frontlines, responsible for the command of disaster relief forces in Nepal.
