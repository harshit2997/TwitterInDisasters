The Singapore Civil Defense Force (SCDF) will send a 55-man search-and-rescue team to quake- hit Nepal, and the Singapore Armed Forces (SAF) will also support the relief efforts with deployment of suitable resources, Singapore Press Center said in press release Saturday night.

Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong says Singapore stands ready to help those affected by the tragedy. The SCDF, Singapore Police Force (SPF) and SAF will be deploying various assets to assist Nepal in its post-disaster operations.

Besides efforts by the SCDF, SPF and SAF, Singapore is also looking at other areas of assistance, such as medical and humanitarian aid.

The SAF will deploy a medical team of about 15 medical personnel, as well as personnel from the Changi Regional Humanitarian Assistance and Disaster Relief (HADR) Coordination Center, to assist in relief efforts in Nepal in the wake of the earthquake that struck Nepal on 25 April 2015.

Republic of Singapore Air Force C-130 aircraft will provide airlift support to transport the Singapore relief contingent, which includes SCDF and SPF personnel and their equipment, into the affected area.

In the meantime, Prime Minister Lee expressed condolences, saying that the Singapore Government has also expressed its deepest condolences to the families of the victims and the people of Nepal over the earthquake in Nepal on Saturday that claimed hundreds of lives.

Singapore's Foreign Ministry said Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong has written a condolence letter to Nepal Prime Minister Sushil Koirala.
