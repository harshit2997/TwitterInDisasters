A Queenstown woman with a track record of helping Nepal is organising a walk to raise money for the earthquake devastated nation.

Honor Mathieson and fellow members of Rotary group Pure NRG Queenstown are planning a ''Walk for Nepal'' to the summit of Queenstown Hill next Saturday.

Participants will be asked to make the walk without taking food or water, and also to make a donation to Rotary backed disaster relief charity ShelterBox.

Miss Mathieson said that since hearing about the 7.8 magnitude earthquake and aftershocks at the weekend, she had been wondering how she could help.

Last September, Miss Mathieson and her partner took 25kg of medical supplies to Nepal while on a holiday in the region. Delivered to Rotarians in Nepal, the items were donated by Pure NRG Queenstown members, Lakes District Hospital, Queenstown Medical Centre, physiotherapy clinics and other businesses, charity groups and residents.

She hoped the walk would be supported by the resort's schools, businesses, residents and visitors.

Queenstown residents tended to be well travelled, and she expected many had visited Nepal and, like her, been struck by the friendliness, generosity and ''positive attitude'' of its people, she said.

Through the fame of Sir Edmund Hillary and the work of the Himalayan Trust, New Zealanders received a particularly warm welcome in the country.

ShelterBox, which delivers emergency shelter and supplies to people affected by disaster, had been chosen as the beneficiary of the walk.

â€¢ The ''Walk for Nepal'' will be held on Saturday, May 9. Participants should meet at the entrance to the Queenstown Hill Walkway on Belfast Tce at 2pm.

Donations to ShelterBox can be made at: www.givealittle.co.nz/cause/walkfornepal
