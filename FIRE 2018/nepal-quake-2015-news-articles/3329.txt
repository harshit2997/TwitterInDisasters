Howard was devastated when he had to be taken off the mountain by helicopter because he became ill.

He returned to his Manchester home, disappointed his trip to Nepal was cut short. Now he says he’s thankful as he was supposed to be there three days later when the earthquake struck.

Howard’s itinerary would have placed him directly in the path of the avalanche that swept through the Mount Everest base camp.

“We would’ve been right near the top, either at base camp or just coming down,” said Howard.

Howard and his hiking partner made it to 13,000 feet, but didn't reach their goal of the Mount Everest base camp.

“We were so sick the next day with what they call acute mountain sickness. Basically we were too sick to go down,” said Howard.

“They got us helicoptered down to Kathmandu in the helicopter and were in the hospital for two days,” said Howard.

Howard has traveled the world in his retirement. He brought home prayer flags and beads from Nepal to share with his relieved brother.

“It would have been devastating if we couldn't communicate with him or get him back home, so we're thankful to the good Lord that's he's back home,” said Glenn Howard, Duane’s brother.

“So yeah, it's a blessing to be back with the people who are important,” said Howard.

Howard has no plans at this point to return to Nepal, but is finding ways he can help victims from back home in New Hampshire.
