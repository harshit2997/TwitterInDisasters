News agency TT reports that so far the Swedish Foreign Ministry has no reports of injured or missing Swedes in the area. According to the ministry, 44 Swedish nationals reside in Nepal, but there is no information on how many Swedish tourists were in the area at the time.

Speaking with Swedish Radio, tourist Jonas Nyberg from Gothenburg survived the quake in Kathmandu.

"I was in my room at the hotel in the old city. Then it began to shake and windows fell out. I laid under the mattress and waited it out and then I went down," he said by telephone.

He described the streets as panicked and chaotic with many buildings damaged or destroyed.

Nepal police have confirmed nearly 900 died in the quake outside of Kathmandu that measured 7.8 on the Richter scale.
