Trekking for Nepal



YOUNG Public School Council are rallying students to help the people of Nepal in the wake of the devastating April 29 earthquake.

The Term 2 fundraiser sits around the theme “Think of Others” and involves a trek.

As many readers will know Nepal attracts people from all around the world – people who visit that country in order to take part in treks through the mountains.

So tomorrow all students will be participating in a “trek” down and up Campbell Street tomorrow.

They are hoping their efforts and presence along this main road may draw the attention of many people to the plight of the Nepalese children and their families.

In addition to making their own gold donations - they will be asking members of the public to also donate.

Money raised will be donated to the Red Cross Appeal for Nepal.

Red Cross mobile van to visit next week

The Red Cross mobile van still have positions vacant for their visit to Young.

The Australian Red Cross Mobile Blood Service will be visiting Young next week on the following dates:

Monday, May 11, 9.30am-2.30pm (eight more donors needed).

Tuesday, May 12, 1pm-7.30pm (eight more donors needed).

Wednesday, May 13, 8am-2pm (18 more donors needed).

If you haven’t already made an appointment to give blood, you can make an appointment online or call us on 13 14 95.

One in three Australians will need blood, but only 1 in 30 donates. Donated blood helps cancer patients, people with blood disorders, mothers-to-be and newborn babies, as well as trauma and surgical patients.
