(Neb)-Pilot Of Downed Chopper In Nepal A Nebraskan Listen By: John Axtell Posted at: 05/15/2015 01:37 PM

The pilot of the U-S Marine Corps helicopter that crashed Tuesday while delivering aid to earthquake relief efforts in Nepal was a Nebraskan. 28-year old Capt. Dustin Lukasiewicz was from Wilcox.



The wreckage of the helicopter was found this morning in a dense forest at an elevation of 11,000 feet about 33-miles from the capital of Kathmandu.



Three bodies have been recovered so far and officials say it's unlikely any of the 6 marines and 2 Nepali soldiers on board survived.



Lukasiewicz was in a video put out recently by the Marine Corps about the relief work being done since a massive earthquake on April 25th that killed more than 8,000 people.



PLAY SOUND BITE



Captain Lukasiewicz served in Marine Light Attack Helicopter Squardon 469 at Camp Pendleton, California.



The unit was on a training mission in the Philipines when it was sent to Nepal for the relief effort as part of Joint Task Force 505.



Lukasiewicz is part of a large farming family in Howard County, northwest of Grand Island. He graduated from Wilcox-Hildreth High School in 2003 and the University of Nebraska-Lincoln in 2007.



Lukasiewicz and his wife Ashley have one child and are expecting another next month. Comments:
