Rivals India, China win hearts, minds

Pokhara, May 1, 2015, AFP: 1:26 IST

At Pokhara airport in the Himalayas, Indian soldiers race back and forth loading rice, blankets, tarpaulins and other aid onto waiting helicopters for delivery to quake-devastated villages.



In the ruined ancient town of Bhaktapur, Chinese rescuers in blue uniforms search for survivors in the rubble of toppled temples and homes.



Nepal’s overwhelmed government has been criticised by frustrated residents, hundreds of thousands of whom are desperate for assistance after Saturday's monster quake.



But foreign countries, with their medics, specialist rescuers and helicopter sorties, have won applause, with giant neighbour India sometimes singled out for praise as the biggest provider. India and economic powerhouse China have long vied for influence in the impoverished Himalayan country which was ripped apart by the quake, leaving more than 6,200 people dead.



China has dispatched about 300 personnel to Nepal and announced about $10 million in aid so far, according to state media. Prime Minister Narendra Modi has promised to “wipe the tears of every Nepali” while the country’s air force alone has sent 950 personnel and dropped more than 400 tonnes of aid .



“We share a long border with Nepal and any turmoil there can spill into India,” Singhal, senior fellow at the Gateway House think tank in Mumbai, said. “It is in our interest to see that Nepal gets back on its feet as soon as possible.”



Nepal’s Foreign Minister Mahendra Bahadur Pandey has attempted to strike a balance, saying his government is grateful to its “very good friend” India, but also quick to mention China. Analyst Amitabh Mattoo said this time China seemed to be upping the ante.



“China is using aid and help in Nepal as an instrument of its foreign policy,” said Mattoo, a professor at Jawaharlal Nehru University.
