Foreign Minister Murray McCully says that the New Zealand Urban Search and Rescue team due to leave for Nepal overnight has been stood down.

"New Zealand is committed to helping the people of Nepal recover from the devastating earthquake which struck on ANZAC Day," Mr McCully says.

"Our USAR team has been on stand-by since Sunday and was due to head to Nepal last night. Prior to their departure, the Nepalese Government informed us that they had enough USAR capability in-country and our team was no longer required.

"We completely understand the Nepalese Governmentâ€™s decision and based on our own experience of managing the Christchurch earthquakes, we know that dealing with international offers of assistance can be fast moving and needs can change rapidly.

"It is heartening to see the international community come to the aid of the people of Nepal. Our USAR team remains ready to assist if needed, and the Government will continue to assess how we can further contribute," Mr McCully says.

New Zealand has made an initial contribution of $1 million to the immediate relief effort.
