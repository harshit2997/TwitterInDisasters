Nepal quake victims need our support

There will be a huge demand for immediate and longer-term aid and relief materials

The images coming out of Nepal now in the wake of Saturdayâ€™s deadly earthquake are truly frightening and emotional. And equally, the reports of how desperate villages, hikers in base camps, or city dwellers in Kathmandu had to dig through rubble in a race to try and rescue survivors are equally distressing.



While the death toll from Nepal increases with every passing hour, there is little doubt that the mountainous nation, along with tracts of northern India, will need a massive input of aid and relief services from the international community.



It is at times like these that we should pause for a minute and reflect on those who are less fortunate.



For those living in villages and towns devastated by the events of Saturday and strong aftershocks yesterday, we should spare a thought and a quiet prayer. And we should dig into our wallets and contribute what we can to help these shattered people rebuild their lives and homes from the rubble of the tremors.



Already, the Government of the UAE is reacting. Under the directives of President His Highness Shaikh Khalifa Bin Zayed Al Nahyan, and instructions of His Highness Shaikh Mohammad Bin Zayed Al Nahyan, Crown Prince of Abu Dhabi and Deputy Supreme Commander of the UAE Armed Forces, the Emirates Red Crescent is to deliver urgent humanitarian assistance to the people of Nepal. The UAE aid workers and search and rescue team are on their way there to help.



There will be an immediate need to send medical supplies and specialised rescue services and technicians who are experts in extricating the injured from the smothered and cramped confines of collapsed buildings. And there will be a longer-term need to rebuild battered infrastructure, build new bridges, replace hospitals, water pipes, electricity lines and construct better schools.



The scale of this tragedy is immense. But the people of Nepal should know that they have the prayers, thoughts and support of their friends here. And we are here to help.
