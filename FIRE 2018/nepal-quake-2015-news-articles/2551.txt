Bulgarian authorities have established contact with all Bulgarian nationals whose stay in Nepal has been registered, according to Petko Todorov, Bulgaria’s Ambassador to India.

Todorov told the Bulgarian National Television that there was no information about injured Bulgarians in Saturday’s 7.8 magnitude earthquake in Nepal.

He made clear that there were around 20 Bulgarians, mostly tourists, in Nepal, adding that the majority of them were staying in the capital Kathmandu.

Todorov said that there was no information about Bulgarians resident in Nepal.

Todorov said that for a certain period of time on Monday Bulgaria’s honorary consul to Kathmandu had been unreachable due to a power cut which had made it impossible to charge cell phones.

Betina Zhoteva, Spokesperson for the Foreign Ministry, said that air traffic at the airport in Kathmandu had been restored and that several airlines were conducting additional flights to enable everybody who was willing to leave the country to do so.

She also assured that the authorities had established contact with all Bulgarian citizens whose stay in Nepal had been registered.
