Michigan Tech professor explains Nepal earthquake

The earthquake destroyed about 70,000 homes, and killed more than 5,000 people. It was a result of the shifting of the Asian and Indian plates, which happens periodically.

Emergency responders have trained for just such a disaster. One Michigan Tech professor has traveled to Nepal to participate in a conference to prepare for an event of this magnitude.

Wayne Pennington, the Dean of College of Engineering at Michigan Tech, said, "The military is, of course, the only organization that can respond really quickly and in a big way. They need helicopters. They need the types of vehicles that can get through those impassible roads and so on. It's often difficult for the military to work with civilian organization. They have sort of different cultures, you might say. So they have these planning meetings to make sure they know how to do that smoothly."

This earthquake was a magnitude 7.8. The last big earthquake like this in Nepal was 80 years ago.
