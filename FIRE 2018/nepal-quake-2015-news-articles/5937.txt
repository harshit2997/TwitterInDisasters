Remote areas in Nepal devastated; India offers all help
</headline>

Nepal's remote mountainous areas have suffered "almost total devastation" from a powerful quake that claimed over 6,300 lives, aid agencies warned today even as relief slowly began to reach far-flung regions amid fresh aftershocks that kept people on edge.



Top Indian officials today took stock of the situation in the battered country as they assured Nepal of all possible assistance.



National Security Advisor Ajit Doval and Foreign Secretary S Jaishankar called on Prime Minister Sushil Koirala soon after their arrival here to discuss the rescue and relief operations in the areas affected by the earthquake.Tremors jolted Nepal for the sixth day today as rescuers struggled with disposing off dead bodies and sifting through mounds of rubble for rare survivors after hopes of finding them were rekindled following the miraculous rescue of a teenage boy and a young woman yesterday.International humanitarian bodies called for greater urgency in relief efforts as the death toll from Saturday's devastating temblor topped 6,300 while the number of injured reached around 14,000."One of our teams that returned from Chautara in Sindupalchowk district reported that 90 per cent of the homes are destroyed. The hospital has collapsed, and people are digging through the rubble with their hands in the hope that they might find family members who are still alive," said Jagan Chapagain, Director of Asia Pacific with the IFRC."We can expect the situation to be the same if not worse in many other places where aid has not yet been delivered," Chapagain said.There are estimates that up to 40,000 homes in Sindupalchowk alone have been destroyed, the IFRC said in a statement.The amount of emergency aid needed for such a large-scale disaster outstrips the capacity of Kathmandu's small and the country's only international airport, which is receiving an extremely high volume of aid flights now coming into Nepal, it said.Meanwhile, relief was slowly beginning to reach remote mountainous towns and villages after efforts were earlier hampered due to heavy rains and aftershocks.According to the Home Ministry, 20 helicopters carrying relief have landed in the districts of Sindhupalchok, Dolakha, Rasuwa, Nuwakot, Dhading and Gorkha - some of the worst-hit areas.
