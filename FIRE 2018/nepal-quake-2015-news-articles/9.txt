The Government of Sri Lanka has taken steps to provide emergency relief to those affected by the earthquake in Nepal, the Prime Minister office said.



The statement said:



Immediately after hearing about the tragedy President Maithripala Sirisena and Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe discussed the issue and decided to provide relief. To this end a special committee headed by their two respective secretaries was set up.



Prime Minister Wickremesinghe informed his Nepali counterpart that President Sirisena had decided to offer whatever help was possible to alleviate the suffering of those affected. He also expressed the sorrow of the Government and people of Sri Lanka at the plight of the victims.



The Prime Minister also spoke with the Acting Ambassador of Nepal in Sri Lanka and the Ambassador of Sri Lanka to Nepal to obtain information about the urgent needs of the Nepali people. Accordingly an Air Force plane will leave for Nepal at 2.00 am tomorrow (26th) carrying four doctors, other medical staff and medicines. They are due to arrive in Katmandu at 7.00 am.



In addition a SriLankan Airlines flight carrying dry rations and other essential items will also leave for Katmandu tomorrow afternoon. Arrangements have been made to bring back Sri Lankans including students currently in Nepal in the return flight.
