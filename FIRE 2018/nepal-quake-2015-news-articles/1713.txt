New Haven, Conn. (WTNH)- A Nepalese-American group based in Branford is reaching out to help victims of the devastating weekend earthquake in their homeland.

Ram Hari Bhandari of the Society of Nepalese in America told me he still has not been able to get in touch with some of his relatives int he small village where he grew up about 120 miles away from Katmandu. He also believes the country’s death toll could eventually swell to more than 20-thousand, because so many people living in rural areas, where rescuers are having a hard time getting too.

Hari-Bhandari says ‘A lot of people I couldn’t talk to, they have left the cities. So many, they’re losing families, fathers, sons, mothers, lots of people losing everything. It’s hard to communicate in the place where I was born. In that area all houses were destroyed, there is nothing left there’.

Bhandari also says his wife was in Nepal at the time of the earthquake, but he has been able to speak to her by cell phone and she’s okay. The Society of Nepalese in America is trying to raise money to help send doctors and medical supplies to the earthquake stricken region.
