BOISE, Idaho (AP) — Nepalese students got some support from classmates Tuesday night during a candlelight vigil that brought about 100 students, staff and community members to Boise State University.

KTVB reports the Nepalese Student Association at the university helped organize the event, which included a moment of silence and the singing of Nepal’s national anthem. The group’s president, junior Ujjwal Roy, said the vigil shows what Boise residents really care about.

The students have raised about $3,000 for earthquake recovery in a YouCaring account, and Roy and a couple of Nepalese students at Boise State are headed home next week to help with relief efforts. There are 22 Nepalese students studying at the university.
