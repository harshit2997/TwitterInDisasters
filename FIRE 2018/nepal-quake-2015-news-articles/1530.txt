Update, April 29: Cam and Jacq have made it safely to the American embassy in Nepal and are awaiting transport back to Canada, according to Cam's brother Chris Dobranski.

Original story:

Among the people in the Nepalese mountains when the devastating earthquake struck last week was Calgarian Cam Dobranski, the owner of Brasserie Kensington and Container Bar, who was on a hiking honeymoon.

Cam and his new wife Jacq – married just two days earlier in Nepal – were uninjured by the quake and subsequent avalanches and rock slides, but faced an arduous hike out due to routes being blocked by debris, his brother Chris Dobranski said Sunday.

“There were slides going on all around them and they didn’t know how they were going to get out of there,” Chris said from his home on Vancouver Island, based on a satellite phone call the family received from Cam on Saturday night.

“They said they needed help getting word out to the British Consulate here in Canada because they’re trying to get to a British army base that’s located close to where they’re trying to get out of,” Chris added. “They said again they’re alright, but we don’t know exactly where they are.”

The phone call was brief, he noted, as it seemed as though Cam was sharing a satellite phone with others in his trekking group and the battery power was limited.

The family was still awaiting updates by press time Sunday night.

Chris said it was just a relief to know his brother and new sister-in-law were OK, and even found a bit of humour in the otherwise serious situation.
