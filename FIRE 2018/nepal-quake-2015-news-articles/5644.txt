(JNS.org) Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu thanked Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi for helping rescue Israelis trapped by the earthquake in Nepal.

In a telephone call with Modi on Thursday, Netanyahu expressed gratitude for India providing helicopters to aid the rescue efforts and for permitting Israeli relief planes to land in India.

Modi, in turn, on Twitter thanked Netanyahu “for his kind words on India’s relief & rescue efforts in Nepal, including help extended to Israeli nationals.”

One Israeli citizen, Or Asraf, remains unaccounted for in Nepal. Meanwhile, the Israel Defense Forces field hospital in Nepal’s capital of Kathmandu has treated nearly 250 patients since setting up operations. Israeli doctors have performed 15 life-saving surgeries, the Israeli Foreign Ministry said.

More than 6,200 people have died in the worst earthquake to hit Nepal in 80 years. Search and rescue operations are still underway, especially in remote mountainous regions, where officials fear that the death toll could exceed 10,000.
